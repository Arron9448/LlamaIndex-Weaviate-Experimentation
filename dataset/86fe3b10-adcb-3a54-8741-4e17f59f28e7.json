Everything about it screams style: the rooms are a chic mix of Scandinavian minimalism with a splash European grandeur. There\u2019s a courtyard dotted with greenery and string lights, a lounge with a ping pong table, and a Nordic caf\u00e9 serving open-faced salmon sandwiches and a mean salad ni\u00e7oise. Add the fact that it comes from the team behind the Copenhagen Food Collective, an eco-friendly, farm-to-table enterprise with 14 restaurants in the city, the whole thing was born to bathe in buzz.", "But there\u2019s something else that makes it such a stylish standout: its sustainability.", "When owner Christian Lytje bought the hotel a few years ago, he also bought a solar farm. A substantial one, at that: it\u2019s the size of about nine soccer fields. Why? \u201cTo produce our own energy,\u201d Lytje explains. And then some: the park produces 30 percent more energy than the hotel, and Copenhagen Food Collective\u2019s restaurants, use. As a result, Coco has a negative carbon footprint.", "Their commitment doesn\u2019t stop there. The hotel is almost completely plastic-free. All bedding, and towels, are made from organic cotton. The building is Green-key certified. And, if you book a room via their website, the hotel will donate a tree on your behalf."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["bought", "food", "energy", "thats", "effortlessly", "coco", "copenhagen", "negative", "website", "restaurants", "lytje", "hotel", "carbon", "theres", "cooland"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
