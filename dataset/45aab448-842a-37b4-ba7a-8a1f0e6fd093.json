Kiana Muschett-Owes, the owner of Katie O\u2019s Soul Food, in Brooklyn, says $5 per meal covers only the cost of her ingredients, not the staff to prepare them or the handwritten notes she tucks into each box of catfish and cheesy grits. Rethink is advising her and others on how to manage costs and obtain lines of credit. It is also looking into creating a group-buying program that would lower food costs for all its partners.", "That\u2019s enough for Ms. Muschett-Owes.

To date, Rethink has raised $10 million for its Certified program, and Mr. Jozwiak is in talks with chefs, including Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park, to donate a percentage of sales to support the program. Mr. Humm currently donates 10 meals to Rethink for every one ordered through his EMP At Home service.", "Alkimiah has also raised private donations, and already has enough to keep running at least through summer.
