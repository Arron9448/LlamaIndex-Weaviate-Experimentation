All of the factories that were producing his clothes\u2014mostly abroad, and one in Mississippi\u2014had shut down. At the same time, his sales were decreasing. \u201cIt made me question what I was making, whether what I was making wasn\u2019t good, or if people were spending less money,\u201d he says. Out of options, Peel took time to step back and look at his business model. He found two issues with his business. First, he was outsourcing his pieces to be customized at factories, and second, whenever he needed alterations, like bringing in the sides and sewing on patches, he went to a tailor, which could be quite costly. He also rethought the style of his pieces, as his standard mechanic shirt had become rote. \u201cI reached a point where newness and gimmicks aren\u2019t a thing anymore. If my products aren\u2019t super on point, nothing is going to sell,\u201d he says. \u201cI was watching trends and trying to follow them, instead of putting out what I thought was sick.\u201d", "With limited production available, Peel began embroidering, sewing, and screenprinting himself, all in his tiny Chinatown studio. (Currently, his workspace is so small he has to screenprint in the hallway.) With his rudimentary knowledge of sewing, he bought \u201cthe cheapest\u201d embroidery and sewing machines that he could find. \u201cIt was a lot of trial and error. Anyone can learn how to sew but it takes a lot of time and patience,\u201d he says. \u201cI have sewn through my finger before.\u201d He still works with the factory in Mississippi, a family-owned workwear producer that has since resumed production. Peel takes their classic styles and alters them. But the decision to cut his production abroad has helped him bring all of the customizations in-house. The result is a more DIY punk infusion into his workwear. One of Peel\u2019s early self-made creations was a two-tone shirt composed of striped and blue fabric that didn\u2019t come out quite as polished as he had hoped. \u201cThe imperfections don\u2019t make something bad quality or have a shorter life,\u201d he says. \u201cThey show that the piece isn\u2019t made by a machine.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of Peels", "Currently, Peel\u2019s best-selling piece during COVID-19 is a sweatshirt with an embroidered design of a sinister-looking fairy. He\u2019s also created a black bomber jacket and two-toned sweatshirts, both of which boast embroidery and signature patches with the name \u201cPeels\u201d. Even given the steep learning curve, seeing his business slowly develop has been fulfilling for Peel. \u201cI hadn't really felt connected to the audience for so long,\u201d he says. \u201cSo to do everything again, and be hands-on, and have all this time to think about how we could make it better, it became so much more personal.\u201d"], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["takes", "revived", "point", "shirt", "peels", "label", "quite", "sewing", "workwear", "lockdown", "modelbeloved", "peel", "production", "business"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
