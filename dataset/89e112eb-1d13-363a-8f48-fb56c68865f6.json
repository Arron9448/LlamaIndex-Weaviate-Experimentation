And one of the most charged political contests unfolded in West Bengal, where the polls are being conducted in eight phases between late March and late April. Despite the rising cases, numerous public rallies were held, with tens of thousands of people cramped together without masks. Although precise data on the correlation between political campaigning and the Covid-19 spike is unavailable, the number of cases in West Bengal increased tenfold from early to mid-April \u2014 several times the rates in the crowded cities of Mumbai and Delhi.", "The mass political, religious and sporting events, which are extensively covered by the Indian media, sent mixed messages about the seriousness of the pandemic. Popular impatience to get back to earlier lives made things worse. Indians started mixing widely and playing down the threat also because there is an unfounded sense among a large number of Indians that exposure to pollution and microbes had endowed them with superior immunity.", "It was inevitable the virus would roar back. Indians turned out to be as susceptible to Covid-19 as everyone else. I was one of the researchers for the world\u2019s largest Covid-19 contact tracing study last year, covering over 660,000 people in two southern Indian states. We found that an early lockdown \u2014 it began when there were fewer than 1,000 reported cases \u2014 had kept the virus under control.", "The risk of getting infected through exposure to someone with the coronavirus is no different in India. The proportion of people who died after a Covid-19 diagnosis is lower in Indian compared with many other countries. But that is simply because 65 percent of Indians are under 35 years old.", "Indians with Covid-19 ages 40 to 70 were more likely to have died in India because of the high prevalence of comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and respiratory disorders. Covid-19 patients in our study in their 40s in India were twice as likely to die as Covid-19 patients in the corresponding age group in the United States. The rate was 75 percent higher in India than in the United States when we compared patients in their 50s.", "The first wave of Covid was concentrated in poor urban areas, from which it dispersed to rural population centers. Although we don\u2019t have hard data on the socioeconomic status of those infected during the second wave, cases now seem to have reached the middle class and rural India."], "authors": ["Ramanan Laxminarayan"], "keywords": ["patients", "political", "covid19", "indians", "indian", "states", "wave", "coronavirus", "west", "india", "york", "cases", "overwhelmed", "times"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
