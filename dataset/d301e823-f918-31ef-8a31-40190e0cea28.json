Shoot! this not", "it's not clear enough and players are not gonna", "have fun if they don't know how to", "edit windows or doors in Fortnite.", "So it's that sort of things and you're like, Oh! no", "Yeah, for us I think an interesting one", "was around that Flex mode that we just talked about", "on our Z Flip from earlier in the year", "when we launched it, we found that people were actually", "using the camera functionality within the Flex mode", "which was kind of a surprise to us.", "We didn't anticipate as much usage around that", "and so we started looking into", "where there more ways that we could use the camera", "again within that folded form factor.", "So a couple that we came up with for Fold two", "that are going to be really interesting.", "The first is what we call Rear Cam Selfie.", "So because you can open the device", "and have a full view finder on the back", "it allows you to use the Full Triple Camera System", "for any selfies that you're taking.", "So, you know, that gives you access", "to all the Pro video, Pro camera features", "that we have so much more high end camera system", "to take selfie shots and things like that.", "So it makes it super easy where traditionally", "you're just gonna use the front facing camera", "which is usually not as high performance of a camera.", "And so that's one area", "and then another that's interesting", "for more say a content creator", "again back into that hands-free mode,", "you can actually just set the device", "on a tabletop like this", "and if you had no one around to capture", "this might be for someone who's", "into posting videos on YouTube or Instagram", "you can prop it up like that", "and the camera using software and artificial intelligence", "has what we call Auto-Framing.", "So it'll keep the subject in the center of the frame", "no matter what you're doing", "it'll actually zoom in and out", "and follow the subject within a certain boundary", "and so that allows you to basically have like", "a camera man behind the phone", "but shooting it all by yourself.", "And again, a lot of those are driven by the fact that", "it's such a unique form factor", "that there's cool and new", "interesting things that we can do with it.", "And a lot of that was just driven from that", "surprise finding that that camera", "was really where people wanted to engage", "with that new form factor.", "That's very cool.", "I can't wait to get my hands on one of these.", "So in this discussion, we kind of explored how", "the whole field of design draws upon an understanding", "of people like user perception", "and cognition to make technology work for people", "like make technology work for people", "the way they like to work and think.", "We have also witnessed how some companies", "can use this understanding to manipulate users", "where engagement turns into addiction", "and technology takes over our attention.", "I wanna hear your respective thoughts on this", "and how do you try to strike a balance, if at all?", "Yeah Drew can start now,", "Yeah I'll take this then.", "Yeah, I think there's, a lot of tools", "that we can put in place to really help users", "gauge how they want to engage with their", "own kind of products and environments", "and services and so, a couple that come to mind for me", "are you know, first is around just screen time, right?", "People are concerned around the more time", "they're spending you know, with their smartphones", "that could disrupt sleep patterns, things like that.", "So in all of our products, Fold two included,", "we have a built in blue light filter", "that you can automate and kind of", "customized depending on how you use your own device", "and throughout the day, things like that.", "We also support a full suite of digital wellbeing features", "that are part of the Android ecosystem", "and so those allow you to measure things like", "screen time and even app time", "and if you want to kind of self monitor those,", "it has the tools there to do it", "and then I also think more broadly beyond just phones", "of course, you know, Samsung provides", "a broad ecosystem of products", "and so our wearables for example", "are a great way they're cellularly connected", "so if you wanted to leave the house for a few hours", "and just tune out leave your phone at home", "you can have that connection just in case,", "you know, for emergencies but have the peace of mind", "of not having to look at a screen", "as you're out and about and things like that.", "So we're trying to provide", "a range of different flexible options depending on", "you know, how people want to manage that", "as it relates to their own lives.", "Yeah, so the question about dark patterns", "and addiction, first of all, addiction is", "very specific that when we talk about addiction", "in the common language,", "we mean pathological use and loss of control.", "So hope, you know, I thank goodness,", "this doesn't happen that often.", "But what we want to care about is", "we don't, force your users or your players", "in the case of video games to stay,", "or to come back, or to pay more.", "So that's a really the difference,", "I usually take the analogy of the difference between", "a magician and a pickpocket.", "Both of these people are using cognitive science", "and the knowledge of brain limitations to do their jobs.", "But the magician does that with our consent", "and it's to entertain us.", "So a magician knows very well, for example", "the limitation of our attention.", "They use a lot of tricks", "to make things appear or disappear without us noticing", "but they do that with our consent", "and we want to be tricked.", "We want to have, you know, that that magic feel", "and it's a win-win situation, you know,", "where we're happy", "and the magician did their job and they're happy too.", "A pickpocket is gonna use also", "the knowledge of limitation of our attention", "to just like steal from us.", "So it's not with our consent", "and it's really exploring our, limitations", "to do stuff that is not beneficial for us", "and it's only beneficial for the pickpocket.", "So this is the difference between the two.", "And when you have a UX mindset,", "you do the magic, you put the the user at the center", "of what you're doing and you want to win-win situation.", "You know, the bigger product is working", "and so the people are happy", "and so your product is going to be successful", "because you have that trust relationship.", "In games, the additional complication is that", "people play games to be entertained", "and so we need to be on, you know,", "to be engaging in games so that people can have fun", "and the difference is when we try to force people", "to come back as at a specific time", "otherwise they're gonna lose something", "that they care about", "so it's really sometimes really difficult", "to navigate these gray areas", "and this is a topic that I really care about,", "that's why with a few people", "we launched The Ethical Games Initiative to talk about", "all these gray areas and where would be the line", "when the game is just fun and engaging", "and when does it start when the game is like", "tricking people to come back", "when they did not really want to that day.", "So it's a difficult topic.", "It's very nuance but it's very important", "to make that difference.", "Well, I personally have never played Fortnite", "but I keep hearing about", "how incredibly engaging it is.", "So I also appreciate that you and your colleagues", "are actively thinking about", "the balance and the line between", "engaging and addiction, engagement and addiction.", "So thank you.", "Celia, Andrew, thank you so much for joining us today", "and sharing your insights and your experiences with us.", "We've learned a lot about", "how your respective companies Thank you Irene", "have employed design so thanks so much.", "Yeah,
