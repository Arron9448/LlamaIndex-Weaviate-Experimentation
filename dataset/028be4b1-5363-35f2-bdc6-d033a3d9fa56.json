In one clip, protesters screamed at police that they had been invited to the Capitol by Trump", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t shy away from their crimes, because they thought they were following orders from the commander-in-chief. And so they would not be punished,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came because he told them to.\u201d", "Congressman Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, walked senators through several instances in which Trump had encouraged and sanctioned violence by his supporters.", "Those examples included Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, last year.", "After Trump\u2019s repeated attacks, his supporters, some heavily armed, invaded the Michigan state capitol in Lansing last April, which Raskin said was a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for what was to come on 6 January in Washington.", "Trump did not condemn the attack, Raskin noted, leading supporters to again storm the state capitol two weeks later. The dangerous consequences of Trump\u2019s rhetoric would become clearest in October, the congressman alleged, when 13 men were charged in connection with a plot to kidnap Whitmer.", "\u201cThese tactics were road-tested,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cJanuary 6 was a culmination of the president\u2019s actions, not an aberration from them.\u201d", "Jamie Raskin: \u2018These tactics were road-tested.\u2019 Photograph: Getty Images", "The argument rebuts the point, advanced by Trump\u2019s lawyers in their impeachment briefs, that Trump\u2019s speech during a rally near the White House on 6 January is protected by the first amendment to the US constitution, governing free speech, and that he does not bear responsibility for what the rioters chose to do afterwards.", "House Democrats were expected to focus on Donald Trump\u2019s \u201clack of remorse\u201d and the lasting damage of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol as they conclude their case for convicting Trump in the ongoing impeachment trial.", "The impeachment managers \u2013 House Democrats essentially serving as prosecutors \u2013 will continue to focus on Trump\u2019s role in the attack as well as the deep toll and harm from it, according to senior aides.", "Their presentation on Thursday follows a day when Democrats repeatedly showed harrowing video of the 6 January attack, some of it never publicly seen before.", "The disturbing security camera footage and other video clips came as they laid out a meticulous case for how Trump deliberately fomented the violence on 6 January and then, once it began, abdicated his constitutional duty to protect the United States.", "The footage shown in the session in the Senate on Wednesday included a revelation that the Utah Republican senator Mitt Romney was extremely close to the mob overrunning the Capitol until he was tapped on the shoulder by the Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman and told to turn around.", "Other footage showed Daniel Hodges, another officer, yelling as he was crushed in a doorway \u2013 an image that visibly upset some of the senators watching the proceeding.", "Tommy Tuberville, a Republican senator from Alabama, also revealed on Wednesday that he had told Trump that his vice-president, Mike Pence, had been evacuated from the Senate chamber as the attack was ongoing.", "The disclosure was significant because it suggested Trump was aware Pence was in danger as he attacked him on Twitter on 6 January for not overturning the electoral college vote.", "The disclosure also supports the narrative from House impeachment managers that Trump violated his presidential oath by not doing anything to stop an attack on the US government.", "The Democrats remain unlikely to succeed in getting the Senate to convict Trump and bar him from holding future office. They need to get 17 Republican senators to vote for conviction, a high bar.", "Still, impeachment aides projected confidence it was one they could clear.", "Aides who worked on Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial said there was a notable difference on Tuesday in how the senators responded.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to think of a moment from the first trial where all 100 senators sat at attention and were as rapt and challenged by the evidence as we saw yesterday,\u201d an aide said.", "Senator Bill Cassidy switched his position to vote for the trial to proceed having previously voted not to do so.
