It was March, 2020, and he was touring with his standup show \u201cWhoopsie Daisy,\u201d in which he riffed on, among other things, the loneliness he\u2019d faced after moving from Melbourne to Los Angeles. \u201cI don\u2019t like being alone, but I\u2019m not good at being around people,\u201d he\u2019d told an audience earlier that night, at the SoHo Playhouse. \u201cI asked my friends how I could be better at socializing. I had never considered it before\u2014I was twenty-eight! And they said, \u2018Josh, what you need to do is, you need to ask questions, and then listen to the answers.\u2019 \u201d Glancing around the theatre incredulously, he asked, \u201cHave you guys heard about this?\u201d After the performance, I walked with him to the West Village, eventually ducking into the bar, Julius\u2019, in search of food. Upon entering, Thomas ran into an ex-boyfriend from Australia, who was vacationing in the city. They exchanged a few pleasantries\u2014then, after the ex was out of earshot, he confided to me that the relationship had ended gruesomely. \u201cI\u2019m a bit embarrassed now,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s good narrative for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Thomas, now thirty-three, is the creator of \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d the Australian series that became a queer cult classic, and the American sitcom \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay,\u201d about a teen-ager on the autism spectrum, which is about to begin its second season on Hulu. Whether onscreen, onstage, or off, he speaks quickly and editorializes often. If he decides that an anecdote is insufficiently interesting, he\u2019ll abandon it, refusing entreaties to keep going. If a story is good, his desire to tell it defeats any sense of self-preservation. Thomas said of the ex, \u201cWe had had, like, a proper romance. And he said to me, \u2018I really like you, but I don\u2019t want to have sex with you. I\u2019m not attracted to you. I think it\u2019s better that I tell you the truth.\u2019 \u201d Thomas, who has compared his own face to a \u201cmelted candle,\u201d mimed outrage to me, but he was suppressing a grin. \u201cI said, \u2018Absolutely not! You should have lied! No one wants to be told that. I would so much prefer it were my personality, or anything, than this. This is the worst thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me\u2014but at least it\u2019s so crazy that I can use it.\u2019 \u201d On \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d in which he played a gay twentysomething also named Josh, he restaged the breakup almost word for word.", "As with many contemporary comedians, mining unpleasant experiences for humor\u2014even tragic ones\u2014is second nature to Thomas. On \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d the most striking element taken from his personal history is the first suicide attempt of his mother, Rebecca, who was subsequently given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In the pilot, Thomas re-creates the experience: Josh wakes up late the following morning to a slew of voice mails from his father, which he listens to in reverse chronological order, with mounting panic. His mother, named Rose in the show, survives, but the hospital won\u2019t release her unless she has someone to watch over her. Josh\u2019s parents are divorced, so he moves in. As Rose contends with her mental illness, Josh begins to come to terms with his sexuality.", "As Thomas observes in \u201cWhoopsie Daisy,\u201d fictional characters confronted with bad news tend to \u201creally quickly understand the emotional ramifications, and then show all the emotions on their face.\u201d He goes on, \u201cI don\u2019t do that. I usually feel a bit startled and, honestly, a bit embarrassed I\u2019m not behaving the way I think I should, because of television.\u201d On Thomas\u2019s shows, traumatic events aren\u2019t cleanly processed. Characters routinely stumble and regress; there are no tidy \u201carcs.\u201d According to Thomas\u2019s longtime friend Tom Ward, who appeared on \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d and has written for both shows, Thomas so dislikes sitcom clich\u00e9s that he leans on people around him to supply authentically awkward material. \u201cWe had an unspoken agreement that honesty was the best way to create work,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt was a gift when something terrible happened to one of us.\u201d He described entering the writers\u2019 room for \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d and announcing, with a sigh, that over the weekend an ex-girlfriend\u2019s rabbit had died in his care. Inevitably, the incident was incorporated into a script. Thomas told me, \u201cIt\u2019s nice when bad things happen and there\u2019s a little ray of sunshine\u2014like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gonna get something out of this.\u2019 \u201d", "Thomas, who grew up in Brisbane, began performing at comedy venues in high school. At seventeen, he won the open-mike competition at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Within a few years on the standup circuit, he had risen to national prominence, but started to feel the limitations of the form. In a monologue, he could present only one side of a story, and confessional anecdotes had to be defanged to keep the audience on his side. \u201cThat really annoyed me\u2014having to be cute, and that getting in the way of honesty,\u201d he said. He began developing \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d in consultation with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which eventually commissioned a first season.", "By then, he was in his early twenties, and just beginning to acknowledge the fact that he was gay. As part of this reckoning, Thomas rewrote the pilot of \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d changing the sexuality of his character\u2014and the network found itself in possession of a sitcom with a gay lead. In an early episode, Josh complains that the coming-out ritual feels \u201cso nineties,\u201d and Thomas, in his own life, took the most perfunctory approach possible. He texted his dad, \u201cWhen does your flight get in tomorrow? Also I live with my boyfriend. See ya!\u201d", "When \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d first aired, in 2013, it was refreshingly unconcerned with the respectability politics of the moment. While Cam and Mitch were embodying sexless, just-like-you domesticity on \u201cModern Family,\u201d Josh was meeting guys on Grindr and experimenting with non-monogamy. The show\u2019s millennial-auteur-as-star format, meanwhile, drew comparisons to Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls.\u201d Like Hannah Horvath, Josh was a more flawed version of his creator, prone to impulsive and selfish behavior. He left his mother in the care of her elderly, irascible aunt so that he could go on a date; after a friend ate his truffle mac and cheese, he barricaded him in his room\u2014and turned off the Wi-Fi. Ultimately, though, the show\u2019s tone was forgiving: yes, Josh could be a jerk, but so could everybody. \u201cThe superpower I had with \u2018Please Like Me\u2019 is that the gay person was based on me,\u201d Thomas told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to really justify anything. I could just be, like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I do,\u2019 and no one could really challenge me.\u201d", "Thomas\u2019s onscreen persona, a student whose main passion was cooking elaborate meals, was gentler than that of Larry David, whose character on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d revelled in overstepping social boundaries that Josh seemed not to recognize at all. Larry antagonized people on purpose; Josh was largely an accidental offender. And though the protagonist of \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d was self-centered, the show was a model of empathy. As Josh spun his wheels professionally and romantically, other characters were given ample room to have dramas of their own.", "Partway through the series, a manic episode led Rose to enter a psychiatric clinic, and the show turned much of its focus to the people receiving treatment there. These characters grappled with everything from panic attacks to self-harm, and for many viewers the show\u2019s candid treatment of mental health was a revelation. To portray the patients\u2019 lives convincingly, Thomas decided, research was required. \u201cMy own personal experience didn\u2019t make me an expert,\u201d he explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what was going on for my mum. We were kind of too awkward to talk about it.\u201d He toured a clinic in Melbourne and consulted a psychiatrist there. Thomas recalled \u201can awful day where he ran me through all the ways people have killed themselves in the hospital, in spite of all the measures that they take.\u201d In a conversation with another expert, Thomas\u2019s interest in a romantic subplot for one of the inpatients inspired him to ask, \u201cWhen people have sex in the hospital, where do they do it?\u201d (The answer: the disabled toilets.)", "Some of these characters became more stable, but, late in the series, one died by suicide, leaving behind a note whose contents were never shared onscreen. Thomas told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t show the note because it would have created this moment that, to a lot of people, would\u2019ve looked quite attractive. Instead, we just show her cold corpse in a morgue on a stainless-steel bench. Because that\u2019s the reality of the decision she made.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe real reason why I was thinking about it more strongly than most people is\u2014my mum\u2019s gonna watch that scene. I don\u2019t want her sitting there watching some fantasy. I don\u2019t want it to look attractive to her.\u201d", "Thomas hadn\u2019t blamed his mother for attempting suicide, but neither had he considered the thinking behind it. \u201cMy attitude was always \u2018It\u2019s mental illness,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cTrying to find logic in her actions\u2014I always thought it was fruitless.\u201d He learned from experts that suicidal people often believe that they\u2019ll be \u201cdoing everyone a favor\u201d by freeing their loved ones from the burden of care. Thomas told me, \u201cI absolutely knew, when I heard it, that that\u2019s what was going on in my mum\u2019s head.\u201d He wrote an episode in which Josh\u2019s mother makes such a confession (after insisting that he smoke weed with her). He said, \u201cWriting it helped me understand my mum better, actually. My character got to grow, and I guess I grew as well\u2014but my character kind of led me to do it.\u201d", "In June, 2018, Thomas walked onto the Disney lot, in Burbank, to lay out his plans for a new series, \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay.\u201d He and Stephanie Swedlove, a Canadian producer who\u2019d worked on \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d were meeting with executives at Disney\u2019s Freeform, a channel known for socially conscious programming. As Swedlove acknowledged, \u201cThe log lines of Josh\u2019s shows don\u2019t immediately scream comedy.\u201d At the meeting, Thomas unveiled the show\u2019s first episode, in which a middle-aged man dies, of pancreatic cancer, in a suburb of Los Angeles, and his son\u2014Thomas\u2019s character, a neurotic young entomologist visiting from Australia\u2014moves in to assume care of two half siblings, one of whom is on the autism spectrum. Thomas, aware that he might come off as an enemy of fun, concluded his presentation by shooting a confetti cannon. He ended up on his hands and knees in the meeting room, picking up colorful scraps of paper.", "\u201cFreeform was really chill,\u201d Thomas told me. \u201cThey wanted it to be queer, they wanted it to be progressive\u2014that\u2019s their whole shtick.\u201d He joked, \u201cIt\u2019s, like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re gay, so that\u2019ll be noble.\u2019 \u201d Immediately, he tested the limits of his mandate, by fighting for the right to say \u201cfaggot\u201d onscreen. Thomas\u2019s character, Nicholas, recounts a fight with his sister Genevieve, who used the slur against him as a young child without understanding its meaning. Genevieve, now a teen-ager, is mortified by the anecdote; Nicholas is simply amused. It\u2019s a moment one can easily imagine playing out between siblings in real life, but executives were skittish, and insisted on running the scene by GLAAD, the L.G.B.T.Q. media watchdog.", "\u201cI was, like, \u2018Why are GLAAD better authorities on homosexuality than I am?\u2019 \u201d he told me. He recalled informing Freeform executives, \u201cI am a top-tier homosexual. They\u2019re not more gay than me.\u201d Fortunately, GLAAD signed off, so Thomas didn\u2019t have to battle the network. \u201cI do think it was the first time anything Disney had ever used the word \u2018faggot,\u2019 which I\u2019m really proud of.\u201d", "In a more serious tone, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had guys kick me in the head and call me a faggot\u2014I know how painful that word is. But, by being so scared of it, you add power to it. You give them a tool.\u201d He grinned conspiratorially. \u201cAlso, honestly, I just thought it was a funny story\u2014and I will find a socially conscious reason to justify something that I think is funny to the end of days.\u201d", "Having created twentysomething and middle-aged characters for \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d Thomas took on a new demographic for \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay.\u201d He decided that a cast filled with teens would, among other things, settle \u201call our decisions about tone.\u201d Whereas Josh could mostly get away with dancing around his feelings, Nicholas, as the guardian of two teen-agers, had to learn to communicate, particularly with Matilda, a high-functioning autistic girl who has deeply held convictions about what a high-school experience should entail\u2014the house parties, boyfriends, and underage drinking promised by pop culture.", "\u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay\u201d is the first American show to feature an autistic lead played by an autistic actor. Neurotypical girls had read for Matilda, but, Thomas said, they all slipped into a \u201csort of robot voice.\u201d After meeting Kayla Cromer on the first day of auditions\u2014and seeing her give a spirited, expressive performance\u2014Thomas knew she was right for the role. Matilda is open about her autism, direct about her desires, and confident in her talent as a budding composer. Eager for romance and intimacy but unsure how to secure them, she consults YouTube for advice on flirtation, emerging with a patchwork of ideas that are half old-fashioned, half avant-garde. After trying alcohol for the first time, she concludes a message to her crush with a cheerful sign-off: \u201cThings are getting lit. Best of wishes!\u201d", "Matilda\u2019s difficulty understanding unspoken rules and social cues heightens the challenges of being a teen-ager. Her schooling is overseen by a special-education teacher, who cautions that Matilda\u2019s dream of living alone in New York City probably isn\u2019t attainable, and criticizes Nicholas for failing to prepare her for such limitations. Nicholas, meanwhile, is brutally frank in ways that leave him on equally unstable footing: he disconcerts his siblings by telling them that he\u2019s not \u201cthe best catch\u201d as guardians go, and horrifies his sweet-tempered boyfriend, Alex, with the revelation that there are moments when he doesn\u2019t love him. \u201cI think that\u2019s normal!\u201d Nicholas insists. \u201cI just think other people are better at lying about it.\u201d Though he is indeed ill-prepared to be an authority figure, his unorthodox approach sometimes succeeds where more conventional methods might fail. As Matilda begins asserting her independence, and Nicholas grows into his responsibilities, the central tension between them becomes what Thomas calls \u201ca universal truth to parenting: how much do you step in and stop your kid from making mistakes, and how much do you let them learn for themselves?\u201d", "Thomas insists that the show is not \u201ca blanket comment on autism\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be these very specific characters.\u201d He\u2019s conscious of the awkward broadness of the \u201cautism spectrum\u201d label, which encompasses both people like Matilda, who can pick up unintuitive social skills with practice, and those who may never learn to speak more than a few words, and require extensive, lifelong support. Even among the comparatively high-functioning teens featured in the series, the condition manifests in distinct ways. \u201cWe wanted to show that they\u2019re all pretty different,\u201d Thomas said.", "As he developed plots for Matilda and her friends, Drea and Jeremy, Thomas interviewed people on the spectrum. He would present a scenario for a character, asking, \u201cDo you believe that?\u201d For the first season, he furnished neurodiversity consultants with detailed descriptions of the trio, double-checking his understanding of such traits as Matilda\u2019s tendency toward sensory overload and Drea\u2019s hyposensitivity to touch. By the second season, the process was made easier by the fact that several advisers had become fans of the show. \u201cThey\u2019ll be, like, \u2018I don\u2019t think Matilda would do this,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey have a sense of who she is.\u201d", "At table reads and on set, Thomas was attentive to suggestions from castmates like Cromer and Lillian Carrier, who is also on the spectrum. Although he\u2019d chafed at commentary around the gay characters on \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d which had treated them as if they were part of a P.R. campaign for the L.G.B.T.Q. community, the experience had alerted him to the stakes of representation for more marginalized groups. \u201cOne of the central things that advocates in the neurodiversity space want is for people to have an understanding that not everyone is interacting with the world the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just asking people to be more forgiving of the fact that different people are going to understand things differently, and different people are going to make different kinds of mistakes. Which is a really nice thing to take on board outside of autism or neurodiversity, I think.\u201d", "Shortly after our night out in the West Village, Thomas returned to L.A. for what would be his final performance of \u201cWhoopsie Daisy\u201d before the city went into lockdown. He cancelled a flight to Australia, and sequestered himself in Laurel Canyon with his dog John and a new puppy, named Bilby. \u201cQuarantine kind of snap-froze everyone\u2019s lives,\u201d he told me over Zoom, as Bilby dozed in his lap. \u201cIf you went in with some trauma, or some grief, or not in a happy place, then you got stuck in it. But I was quite happy when it froze.\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay\u201d had been well received, and he\u2019d made some friends in L.A.", "Amid this relative calm, he found time to address something that had begun to nag at him. When people had asked Thomas why he was so interested in autism, he had often cited the 2015 documentary \u201cAutism in Love,\u201d which follows four people on the spectrum at various stages in their lives and relationships: a boy attempting to date after a painful breakup; a couple contemplating marriage but still working to reconcile \u201cparticular routines and rigidities\u201d; a man whose wife of twenty years is terminally ill. Thomas had never seen the emotional lives of people with autism taken so seriously, and now that he had it astonished him that the \u201cRain Man\u201d stereotype of the inexpressive savant still dominated pop culture. He called up Swedlove and asked, \u201cHow didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d He spoke to her about the documentary subjects\u2019 obvious depth of feeling, and said that their frankness about their needs and desires had moved him. Thomas believed that the skills he\u2019d honed through \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d might equip him to tell such a story himself.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not waffles. It\u2019s never waffles.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by David Borchart", "As he worked on \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay,\u201d he began to wonder whether there was more to his sense of kinship. Years earlier, a psychiatrist had warned him about his \u201csocial dysfunction\u201d and frequent obliviousness of the wants of others. (He later recounted the experience in a standup set: \u201cBasically, I give this lady a hundred and eighty dollars, she sits me down, she tells me I\u2019m a cunt, and she follows it up with \u2018It\u2019s incurable.\u2019 \u201d) Though he didn\u2019t exhibit some traits strongly associated with boys on the spectrum\u2014patterns and numbers held no appeal\u2014his research for the series lent other quirks new resonance. \u201cIf you mention autism to someone, they have a pretty specific image of a pretty specific type of person, and I don\u2019t think I fit that,\u201d he told me recently. But some of the stories recounted by people he\u2019d interviewed felt surprisingly familiar. And, as Season 1 aired, Thomas had noticed that, among fans\u2014many of whom are on the spectrum themselves\u2014there was \u201ca lot of chatter about Nicholas being autistic.\u201d They\u2019d been speculating on Twitter since the show\u2019s January premi\u00e8re episode, in which Nicholas becomes so overwhelmed by the news of his father\u2019s cancer that he leaves the room and refuses to engage. As the season progressed, Nicholas\u2019s behavior strengthened viewers\u2019 impressions."], "authors": ["Alex Barasch", "Alex Barasc"], "keywords": ["thomass", "selfdiagnosis", "josh", "really", "nicholas", "shows", "gonna", "thomas", "told", "gay", "think", "comedy", "autism"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
