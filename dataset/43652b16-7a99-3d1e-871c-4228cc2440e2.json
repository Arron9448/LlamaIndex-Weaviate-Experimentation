Here at WIRED, if a pair of earbuds connects to your phone/computer via Bluetooth, and has no cord that connects the left bud to the right, we just call them wireless. Wireless sets typically come with two popcorn-sized buds, each with a battery inside, and a charging cradle that carries extra battery power and keeps them safe when you're not wearing \u2019em. Others have a cable or neckband that connects the two buds together.", "They're liberating, but they do come with issues, such as limited battery life (don't buy any with less than five hours), confusing controls, and reliance on a charging case. They're also a bit easier to lose than traditional earbuds, and replacing one bud can be expensive.", "Our Picks"], "authors": ["Parker Hall", "Parker Hal", "Jeffrey Van Cam"], "keywords": ["buds", "best", "wireless", "hours", "earbuds", "battery", "work", "wired", "mood", "right", "connects", "youre"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
