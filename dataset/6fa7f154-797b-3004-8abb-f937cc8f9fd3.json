China has maintained research bases in the Earth\u2019s southernmost region since the 1980s, but the approach of these vessels (their names mean \u201csnow dragon\u201d) has been described as the start of a \u201cnew era\u201d for the country\u2019s exploration there. Of about 20 countries that have year-round bases on the continent, China\u2019s activities are growing fastest.", "After crashing through 12-foot waves and nearly 200 nautical miles of ice floes, the two ships drew close to one of China\u2019s stations, called Zhongshan, on Antarctica\u2019s eastern rim (they are pictured, led by Xue Long 2). On November 20th members of the mission\u2019s Communist Party committee flew the final stretch by helicopter, bearing fruit and vegetables for the base\u2019s occupants. It was a moment that China relished. Xue Long is a Ukrainian vessel built in 1993. But the newer of the \u201ctwin dragons\u201d, as China\u2019s media calls its only two civilian icebreakers, was launched just last year. It is far more powerful and manoeuvrable. And crucially, as the country\u2019s media keep pointing out, it was made in China.", "The country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, says China should become a \u201cpolar great power\u201d. At the other end of the world, this ambition has long been evident. The country is excited by possibilities in the Arctic as the Earth warms: fish, minerals, oil and gas that will become easier to extract; new shipping routes that will open up and shorten journeys between China and Europe. To facilitate this, China has been mulling the idea of building ports and other infrastructure in the Arctic.", "The Antarctic has fewer obvious potential benefits for China\u2019s economy. But it is abuzz with Chinese activity. Last year China began building its first permanent airport in the region. Chinese tourists have been piling in: between 2015 to 2018, their numbers more than doubled to about 8,100\u2014second only to the number of American sightseers. In July an American air-force general warned that Antarctica was \u201cjust a number of years\u201d away from becoming as competitive an area as the Arctic, where great powers are jostling for economic and strategic advantages.", "Such rivalry is supposed to be absent in Antarctica. It is governed by the 54 signatories of the Antarctic Treaty, which China joined in 1983. One aim of the 60-year-old pact is to keep Antarctica free of military activity (unlike the Arctic, which is teeming with it). China says it supports that.", "But some Western analysts are suspicious. Elizabeth Buchanan of the Australian National University says the treaty has loopholes. It allows countries to use legitimate scientific study as a cover for military and economic projects. China has installed equipment in Antarctica related to its satellite-navigation system, Beidou\u2014which since this year has been operating more satellites than its American equivalent, GPS. The kit boosts the accuracy of weather maps but also improves missile precision, says Anne-Marie Brady, author of \u201cChina as a Polar Great Power\u201d. Some Western military analysts believe that the crew on China\u2019s icebreakers, though dressed as civilians, are really military personnel.", "China has made it clear it wants more say in governing Antarctica. It resents the West\u2019s sway there\u2014evident, as it sees it, in attempts by Western countries to designate protected areas where fishing is limited or banned. China sees these as a bid by Western countries to \u201cre-exert their dominance over the southern ocean\u201d, says Klaus Dodds, who is a co-author of \u201cThe Scramble for the Poles\u201d.", "China has a controversial proposal of its own. It wants to establish an area under its management in Dome A, a region of nearly 20,000 sq km to which Australia has a largely symbolic claim. It includes the highest point on the Antarctic ice sheet\u2014ideal for astronomical observation. China\u2019s plan, however, has no backers.", "Western polar experts are divided over how much to worry about China\u2019s Antarctic moves. Some believe the country\u2019s main aim is to develop \u201csoft power\u201d, such as by co-operating with other countries in scientific research. All agree on one thing, however. China wants a high profile there. \u25a0"], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["voyage", "antarctic", "xue", "chinas", "antarctica", "south", "icebreakers", "long", "heading", "countrys", "countries", "western", "creating", "headlines", "military", "china"], "id": "6fa7f154-797b-3004-8abb-f937cc8f9fd3", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2019/11/28/the-voyage-of-two-icebreakers-have-been-creating-headlines-in-china"}
