The American Revolution was a violent reaction to changes in the British Navigations Acts, as colonialists felt their rights as British citizens violated by the Parliament and the Crown.", "The Whiskey Rebellion was triggered in 1791 when the new federal government unwisely decided to tax some Americans -- frontier farmers who distilled whiskey \u2013 and not others.", "For decades before the Civil War, southerners bitterly complained about tax policies on imports that favored northern manufacturers over southern planters. While the Civil War was fought over slavery, a nasty debate over tariffs contributed to the sectional division that preceded Southern secession.", "But not all tax revolts are violent. In 1978, Californians overwhelmingly voted to limit state property taxes. Proposition 13, as it was called, revealed a national mood hostile toward taxes. Ronald Reagan, the ex-California governor who endorsed Prop. 13, embraced tax cuts as a central campaign promise and won the presidency.", "BIDEN PLOTS TAX HIKE ON WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS TO FUND $3T INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN", "The low-tax consensus of the Reagan years was cemented, especially among Republicans, when politicians saw what happened when President George H. W. Bush broke his \"read my lips, no new taxes\" pledge. \"Revenue enhancement\" \u2013 what the rest of us call tax hikes -- were poison at the ballot box.", "Today the lessons of our tax history seem to be forgotten, at least within the Democratic Party, which has embarked on a tax-raising bender at both the state and national level.", "We\u2019re about to embark on another national experiment to see how Americans react to tax increases.
