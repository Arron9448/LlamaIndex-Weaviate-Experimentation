For me, it\u2019s a bare mouth that is most telling of my mental state. Among the more dire losses in our era of public masking and working from home is one that, though minor, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in feeling: the intimate tie between a woman and her lipstick.", "I\u2019m not a big makeup wearer, but color and my lips have been going steady for decades. To be honest, it was never an exclusively monogamous relationship. I cheated on my go-to reds with afternoon nudes and even an occasional, unsatisfying fling with fuchsia. Then COVID-19 struck. At home in New York City, we hunkered down and stayed put. The gleaming tubes sat untouched on my bathroom shelves for months, as makeup took a back seat to the project of keeping my family\u2019s little ship afloat.", "But when summer turned to fall and the city began awakening from its long slumber\u2014when my local French bistro started putting tables on the sidewalk, with each group of diners enclosed in their very own transparent vinyl bubble\u2014a deep need to mark the passage of time, to create a sense of occasion in my now largely occasion-less world, stirred within me.", "\u201cLipstick is a transparent emotional layer that defines your mood, feeling, confidence, and creates character,\u201d Pat McGrath, the latter-day guru of lip color, confirms via email, writing from the spring collections in Europe, where fashion marched on and designers made it clear that they hadn\u2019t given up on lipstick. In Milan, makeup artist Lucia Pieroni sent dewy water nymphs down the Versace runway, sprayed with actual H2O, their lips sheathed in dazzling, otherworldly shades of orange and coral; there was a strong-mouth moment at Max Mara, too (think dark-lipped, urban warriors), and at Patou in Paris, where Guillaume Henry\u2019s pretaped ode to joy included voluminous floral smocks, Proven\u00e7al collars, and sporadic slashes of deep crimson lip color.", "Life had been unfolding in black-and-white for quite some time. And my lipstick, though invisible to others, had changed something in my body language or my approach to the world", "IN NEW YORK, where we\u2019re hoping Broadway will reopen by next fall, it looks like we\u2019ll be wearing masks in public for a while. \u201cMasks,\u201d a perpetually single male friend sighs over socially distanced drinks on his terrace one evening, \u201cfavor men with beautiful eyes and may conceal a weak chin.\u201d They also render the lips invisible and lipstick prone to smearing. So what is the place of lip color in our lives right now, and what\u2019s an avid lipstick devotee to do?", "Let\u2019s begin with what it did for us in the Before time. \u201cWhat lipstick meant to me was, like, everything,\u201d says Maryam Nassir Zadeh, the New York\u2013based designer and owner of the \u00fcberchic Lower East Side boutique that bears her name. \u201cIt was my security, my identity.\u201d It shares with heels the power to jolt her awake, Zadeh says. \u201cI\u2019m five foot three, and I feel naked when I\u2019m not wearing a little bit of a heel,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo when I have a shoe on, I\u2019m in my body; I feel it in my posture. And it\u2019s the same with lipstick. When I have it on, I\u2019m myself.\u201d"], "authors": ["Leslie Camhi", "Leslie Camh"], "keywords": ["writer", "transformative", "wearing", "york", "lipstickeven", "zadeh", "vogue", "lipstick", "power", "mask", "transparent", "era", "color", "makeup", "lips", "lip", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
