He mercilessly finished on the ground to the delight of a sellout crowd of 19,040 at T-Mobile Arena.", "PETA CALLS OUT CONOR MCGREGOR, 'COWBOY' CERRONE OVER PYTHON JACKET", "\u201cI feel really good, and I came out of here unscathed,\" McGregor said. \"I'm in shape. We've got work to do to get back to where I was.\u201d", "McGregor\u2019s hand hadn\u2019t been raised in victory since November 2016, when he stopped lightweight Eddie Alvarez to become the first fighter in UFC history to hold two championship belts simultaneously. With his fame and fortune multiplying, McGregor fought only his boxing match with Floyd Mayweather in 2017, and he lost a one-sided UFC bout to lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov in late 2018.", "After a year spent out of competition and in repeated trouble with the law, McGregor got back into training and vowed to return to elite form.

Cerrone, who also holds the UFC record with 16 stoppage wins, had fought a whopping 11 times since McGregor's win over Alvarez, and he was in the cage for the 15th time since he lost his only UFC title shot in December 2015.", "But Cerrone\u2019s last two fights were stopped when he took too much damage, and he couldn't block McGregor's decisive kick or recover from the punishment on the ground.", "\u201cI'd never seen anything like that,\u201d Cerrone said. \u201cHe busted my nose, it started bleeding, and he stepped back and head-kicked me. Oh, man. This happened this fast?\u201d", "Although many observers have scoffed, the 31-year-old McGregor believes he can reclaim the fearsome form he showed during his meteoric rise to unprecedented MMA success.
