The ability to digest milk in adulthood without severe gastrointestinal distress (babies, of course, need to be able to process milk) only came with the arrival of farming.", "So here we have what was clearly a hunter-gatherer, exploiting natural resources as the world around her converted to agriculture. You see, the transition from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to sedentary one was a stepwise process, not a sudden transformation of the whole of Europe into an industrialized food economy. \"However, this transition is still not well known and it is being consistently studied,\" says Emrah K\u0131rd\u00f6k, a paleogeneticist at Mersin University, who wasn\u2019t involved in this work. \"So according to our knowledge, farming was introduced to different parts of the world progressively, and some cultures could have remained as a hunter-gatherer society for some time.\" Our gum chewer was one such holdout.", "Now, about that mouth microbiome. Here we have the tricky matter of bacteria and viruses drifting all over a given environment, so some of the microbes could have landed on the pitch after she spit it out. Luckily, scientists have built a database of known species compositions of microbiomes around the body, including gut, skin, and mouth. The pitch-chewer, these researchers found, had an oral microbiome not all that different from our own. They even found standouts types, like the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can lead to pneumonia, and Epstein-Barr virus, a variety of herpes and one of the more common human viruses. Same woes, different millennium, it seems.", "Also intriguing is the woman\u2019s phenotype, or physical characteristics, as suggested by her genome. In recent history, the European north has been populated by a lot of folks with lighter hair and skin and blue eyes\u2014the idea being that from an evolutionary perspective, fairer skin would help humans in colder, darker climes manufacture enough vitamin D, whereas in hotter climes peoples would need more dark melanin to protect them from the sun. But while this woman had blue eyes, her genes suggest she had darker hair and skin. \u201cThat means that this combination of phenotypic traits was probably fairly common until recently,\u201d says Schroeder. \u201cThat\u2019s only really evolved in Europe in the last 5,000 years, which is interesting.\u201d", "So a tiny piece of chewed-up pitch reveals not only a heap of information about this ancient woman, but also adds a layer to the larger story of human evolution.
