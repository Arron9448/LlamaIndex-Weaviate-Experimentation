The former officer, who has been fired from Minneapolis Police Department, is accused of pressing his knee on or close to Floyd\u2019s neck for what prosecutors have said was 9 minutes and 29 seconds, while Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the pavement on his stomach.", "DEREK CHAUVIN TRIAL: LACK OF OXYGEN KILLED GEORGE FLOYD, NOT DRUGS, EXPERT SAYS", "Police were arresting Floyd outside a neighborhood store, Cup Foods, for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.", "When questioned about his finding that police \"subdual, restraint and neck compression\" led to Floyd\u2019s death, Baker said Floyd had severe underlying heart disease and an enlarged heart that needed more oxygen than normal to function, as well as narrowing of two heart arteries.", "Baker said being involved in a scuffle raises adrenaline, which asks the heart to beat even faster and supply more oxygen.", "\"And in my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of that, those heart conditions,\" Baker said.", "Baker testified that Floyd\u2019s \"use of fentanyl did not cause the subdural or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdural or the neck restraint.\"", "He agreed with prosecutor Jerry Blackwell, who asked: \"These are items that may have contributed, but weren't the direct cause?\"", "Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson has argued that the now-fired white officer did what he was trained to do and that Floyd's illegal drug use and underlying health conditions, not Chauvin's knee, killed him. An autopsy found fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system.", "Baker testified that neither Floyd\u2019s heart problems nor drugs caused his death: \"Mr. Floyd\u2019s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\"", "Under cross-examination, though, Baker agreed with Nelson that Floyd\u2019s heart disease and drug use \"played a role\" in the death.", "Dr. Martin Tobin, an expert witness on Thursday said a healthy person subjected to what Floyd endured would also have died.", "Nelson asked Baker whether he has certified deaths by fentanyl overdose at levels lower than that seen in Floyd\u2019s blood, and Baker said yes. But Baker also noted that levels of fentanyl must be considered in the context of how long someone had used the drug, any tolerance built up to it, and what other substances may be involved", "Baker testified that his examination of Floyd\u2019s heart found no \"visible or microscopic previous damage\" to the heart muscle. The medical examiner also said he did not note any pill or pill fragments while examining Floyd's stomach contents.", "At the beginning of his testimony, Baker said he did not watch the viral video of Floyd\u2019s encounter with police until after he had completed his autopsy.", "\"I did not want to bias my exam by going in with any preconceived notions that might lead me down one pathway or another,\" he said.", "Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist who retired in 2017 from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office and did not work on Floyd\u2019s case, testified earlier Friday that she agreed with Baker\u2019s findings, but appeared to go further, saying the \"primary mechanism of death\" was asphyxia, or insufficient oxygen.", "Thomas said she reached that conclusion mostly from video that showed Floyd struggling to breathe.", "\"This is a death where both the heart and lungs stopped working. The point is, it\u2019s due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression,\" Thomas said.", "During cross-examination, Nelson asked Thomas about what could cause a heart to suddenly stop beating, noting that Floyd\u2019s bigger heart needed more blood and was working hard in a moment of stress and adrenaline, and that one of his arteries had a 90% blockage.", "Thomas said any blockage over 70% to 75% could be used to explain death, in the absence of another cause. But she also said some people can live just fine with an artery that is fully blocked.", "The defense attorney pressed Thomas by posing a hypothetical question.", "\"Let\u2019s assume you found Mr. Floyd dead in his residence. No police involvement, no drugs, right?. The only thing you found would be these facts about his heart. What would you conclude to be the cause of death?\" Nelson asked.", "\"In that very narrow set of circumstances, I would probably conclude that the cause of death was his heart disease,\" Thomas replied.", "In response to another hypothetical posed by Nelson, she agreed that she would certify Floyd\u2019s death as an overdose if there were no other explanations.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "But during re-questioning, Blackwell ridiculed the defense attorney\u2019s hypotheticals and quickly got Thomas to repeat that the cause of Floyd\u2019s death was the restraint by police.", "\"Aren\u2019t those questions a lot like asking, \u2018Mrs. Lincoln, if we take John Wilkes Booth out of this ...\" Blackwell began, before Nelson objected.", "Also on Friday, Judge Peter Cahill called in a juror and questioned her about whether she had been subject to any outside influences. She replied that she briefly saw TV coverage with the sound off and said that her mother-in-law had texted her, \"Looks like it was a bad day\" but that she didn\u2019t reply.", "The judge allowed her to remain on the jury.", "The Associated Press contributed to this report."], "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones", "Stephanie Pagones Is A Digital Reporter For Fox Business", "Fox News.
