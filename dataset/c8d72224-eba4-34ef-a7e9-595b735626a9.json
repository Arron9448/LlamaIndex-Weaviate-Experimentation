Zuboff coined the term \u201csurveillance capitalism,\u201d half a decade ago, to describe the \u201cunique logic of accumulation\u201d\u2014recently pioneered by Google and Facebook and now practiced by every app that secretly scrapes your phone for loose data\u2014in which \u201csurveillance is a foundational mechanism in the transformation of investment into profit.\u201d Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, has insinuated itself through colonialist logic; tech companies wave flags of social improvement while plundering the land of human identity and experience to extract as much value\u2014for themselves\u2014as they possibly can. We get some rewards from this process, of course, and we are constantly being reminded of them: the Internet connects us, the Internet gives us access to information, the Internet makes life convenient. And so, as the Internet becomes essential to social and economic participation, we are forced to accept the specific, monstrous asymmetry that it allows for, in which all accessible human behavior is converted into data and harvested in a process that was designed to be invisible to us, its value accruing only among a small group of technology capitalists. Under surveillance capitalism, we are alienated not just through the way we are forced to express our labor but through the way we are asked to express our lives. \u201cThese new architectures,\u201d Zuboff writes, \u201cfeed on our fellow feeling to exploit and ultimately to suffocate the individually sensed inwardness that is the wellspring of personal autonomy and moral judgement.\u201d But \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d reminds us that the Internet\u2019s central profit model isn\u2019t inevitable, any more than it was inevitable that we allowed our country to be permanently blanketed by pesticides. Surveillance capitalism can be curbed through sustained outrage and regulation, and it\u2019ll have to be, or else. \u2014Jia Tolentino", "\u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming,\u201d by David Wallace-Wells", "You may remember David Wallace-Wells\u2019s article \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth,\u201d which was published in New York magazine in 2017\u2014a piece so widely shared and hotly debated that it required its own Wikipedia article. The story rendered the abstract threat of climate change in concrete, even cinematic, terms, informing the reader without surrendering an ounce of high-level drama. \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming\u201d is Wallace-Wells\u2019s book-length expansion of the piece, and it\u2019s just as potent, if infinitely more depressing. At its worst, it could be described as apocalypse porn. At its best, it\u2019s perhaps the richest inventory of climate-change research yet published. Wallace-Wells makes clear, through a stream of startling factoids, that individual consumption choices can never make the difference that policy changes can. (Our smug organic-produce shopping, in others words, is virtually meaningless.) And yet the tidbit that struck me most was a fairly mundane one. Wallace-Wells writes that higher pollution levels have been strongly linked to premature births and low birth weights\u2014and that the \u201csimple introduction of E-ZPass in American cities reduced both problems, in the vicinity of toll plazas, by 10.8 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, just by cutting down on the exhaust expelled when cars slowed to pay the toll.\u201d Though a grim testament to the danger of carbon emissions, the fact that something as simple as E-ZPass could help is also encouraging. There may not be a silver bullet for climate change, but, as Wallace-Wells argues, there\u2019s still far too much potential for change for hope to be lost. \u2014Carrie Battan", "\u201cInside Out: A Memoir,\u201d by Demi Moore", "The celebrity memoir is very often a noisy thing: from shocking tales of hardscrabble childhoods to juicy, behind-the-scenes dirt on the rich and famous, it\u2019s not a genre that is known for its subtlety. And, on the face of it, Demi Moore\u2019s recent autobiography (which she wrote in collaboration with my colleague Ariel Levy, a New Yorker staff writer) could serve as a prime example of the category\u2019s melodramatic contours. Growing up in an emotionally and economically unstable home, the daughter of two charming but shifty narcissists, who were more often than not on the run\u2014from debt, from the law, from the very notion of parental responsibility\u2014Moore, by sheer force of will, fought her way to become, for a time, Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actress. She also raised three daughters and entered into and then left two high-profile marriages\u2014with the action star Bruce Willis and, later, with the famously younger TV heartthrob Ashton Kutcher\u2014all while battling addiction, health and body-image issues, and a persistent sense of self-doubt that left her, as she writes, \u201cafraid to be in myself, convinced I didn\u2019t deserve the good and frantically trying to fix the bad.\u201d I love a good lurid celebrity autobiography as much as\u2014and maybe even more than\u2014the next guy, but as I read Moore\u2019s I was surprised that what I liked about it wasn\u2019t, in fact, its gossipy revelations but the window it provided into the sensitive, reflective interiority of a woman who, for all her worldly success, has always been searching for the self-acceptance that eludes so many of us, whether we\u2019re famous or not. By the end of the memoir, in a final section titled \u201cSurrender,\u201d Moore writes, of this quest, \u201cThe truth is, the only way out is in.\u201d It is a tribute to the psychological acuity of this book that I felt the earned honesty of these words deeply. \u2014Naomi Fry", "\u201cHow I Became One of the Invisible,\u201d by David Rattray", "The fearless poet, translator, and scholar David Rattray died shortly after the original publication of \u201cHow I Became One of the Invisible,\u201d in 1992. He was fifty-seven, but he seemed to have lived many lifetimes, taking in as much of the world as he could. Trained at Harvard and the Sorbonne, he had an astonishing gift for language, mastering most of the Western ones and also Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek. He became famous at a relatively young age when, as a poetry-obsessed undergrad at Dartmouth, in the fifties, he went to visit Ezra Pound, who was then at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital, in Washington, D.C. He published an account of the visit, in The Nation, in which he managed to humanize Pound without letting him off the hook for his hatefulness. (One of Pound\u2019s former confidants, H.D., said that reading Rattray\u2019s article was the first time in more than a decade that she had laughed with affection about the confined poet.) This, in essence, was Rattray\u2019s great skill: to extend his zealous, compassionate intellect toward anyone, even those who may not have deserved it. This sensibility drove his work as a translator, bringing the works of Artaud or H\u00f6lderin to American readers as an act of empathy. \u201cHow I Became One of the Invisible,\u201d which was reissued this year, by Semiotext(e), is the best kind of autobiographical writing, true to the eccentric digressions and mystical interludes of a life propelled by curiosity. Rattray\u2019s own spirit shines through his incredible stories about all the fringe-dwellers he befriended along the way\u2014thieves, radicals, artists. \u201cVan,\u201d his marvelous account of his friendship with the poet Alden Van Buskirk, opens with their first encounter: Rattray shaking Van Buskirk awake from a drunken slumber so that they could talk about poetry. \u2014Hua Hsu", "\u201cHow to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy,\u201d by Jenny Odell", "Nearly everyone I know who\u2019s read Jenny Odell\u2019s \u201cHow to Do Nothing\u201d had told me that it inspired something akin to a personal crisis. The book, Odell\u2019s first, is equal parts philosophical self-help and environmentalist tract, and it offers a fresh mode for thinking about life under technocapitalism\u2013\u2013and also some suggestions for what might be done. Odell is particularly interested in questioning the assumptions and incentives of the digital economy. The perversions that spring from productivity culture (to say nothing of attention as a currency and a resource) are corrosive not only on the individual level, she argues, but on a larger, social scale. She draws comparisons between the Internet and the natural world, making a case for the long-term maintenance of self, community, and place, both online and off. (\u201cI see little difference between habitat restoration in the traditional sense and restoring habitats for human thoughts,\u201d she writes.) Self-care, in this model, is not commodified self-indulgence; it\u2019s a form of preservation enacted by reclaiming and reallocating one\u2019s attention. Odell is an artist, and her medium, often, is context\u2014historicization, depth, analysis. This seems fitting. In a year in which the boundaries of cruelty and indifference stretched and expanded, there was also, among a certain set, a quieting or refocussing. In my own circles, some people disappeared periodically from Twitter and Facebook. A few grew more knowledgeable about plants and birds, or listened, with great conscientiousness, to non-algorithmic public radio. Most importantly, they began to ground themselves locally and socially and to reconsider where they placed value. The personal crises, it seems, had been productive. \u2014Anna Wiener", "\u201cGo Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest,\u201d by Hanif Abdurraqib", "\u201cGo Ahead in the Rain\u201d is ostensibly a book about A Tribe Called Quest\u2014a hip-hop group that formed in Queens, in the mid-eighties, and recorded six extraordinary albums before Phife Dawg, one of its founding members, died, in 2016\u2014but it\u2019s ultimately more concerned with the furtive and inscrutable ways that music can rearrange a person\u2019s insides. Hanif Abdurraqib is a dexterous and elegant critic, but he understands that the spiritual exchange between artist and fan is sometimes too mysterious to be parsed objectively. So he takes a different approach: between passages detailing Tribe\u2019s musical evolution and its significance to black Americans coming of age in the nineteen-nineties, \u201cGo Ahead in the Rain\u201d contains a series of letters from Abdurraqib to members of the band, in which he unpacks his devotion. \u201cI, too, have an interest in that which can be felt more than heard,\u201d he writes to Q-Tip, one of the band\u2019s M.C.s. Abdurraqib is a poet, and he writes with a precise, gorgeous rhythm that makes a reader want to linger on each line. (My copy of the book is dog-eared and highlighted into oblivion.) But what kills me the most is Abdurraqib\u2019s empathy\u2014for the people who make the music that sustains us, and also for us, for being sustained. \u2014Amanda Petrusich", "\u201cA Woman Like Her: The Short Life of Qandeel Baloch,\u201d by Sanam Maher", "Sanam Maher\u2019s latest book, which is already out in South Asia and the U.K., and which is being released in the U.S. by Melville House in February, is a remarkable account of the life and death of Qandeel Baloch, a Pakistani entertainer who became famous through her bold social-media presence. She was then murdered by her brother, in 2016, for bringing \u201cdishonor\u201d to the family. Powerfully written and narratively creative, \u201cA Woman Like Her\u201d is less a conventional biography than it is an examination of modern-day Pakistan. By tracing Baloch\u2019s brief life\u2014she was only twenty-six at the time of her death\u2014Maher, a Karachi-based journalist, provides illuminating glimpses into Pakistan\u2019s entertainment, modelling, and news industries, and deftly charts the combination of attraction and repulsion with which Baloch\u2019s fascinating online persona was greeted by Pakistani society. \u2014Isaac Chotiner", "\u201cMunicipal Dreams: The Rise and Fall of Council Housing,\u201d by John Boughton", "I moved to London a little more than a year ago, and one of the books that has best helped me understand my new home is \u201cMunicipal Dreams,\u201d a history of council housing in Britain, by the historian John Boughton. (Though published in 2018, the book was reissued in paperback form this year.) Boughton, who is also the creator of a long-running blog of the same name, provides a deeply informed account of the ways in which local and national governments in the U.K. have or have not sought to provide affordable housing for their citizens. His narrative begins by outlining the political and social idealism that underlay the very first council estate in Britain, the Boundary Estate, a well-planned village of Arts and Crafts\u2013style tenements built upon cleared slums in Shoreditch, in London\u2019s East End, in 1900. It ends with the tragedy of Grenfell Tower, a high-rise in West London in which seventy-two people lost their lives, in 2017, when the building\u2019s cladding went up in flames. On the way, Boughton narrates the glory years of council-housing construction, in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, when as much as a third of Britain\u2019s population rented their homes from their local authorities, and when some of the country\u2019s most thoughtful architects experimented with new styles of living. He also charts the right-to-buy schemes instituted in the nineteen-eighties\u2014whereby residents could go from renters to owners, with mixed results for the urban fabric\u2014and takes note of the diminishing commitment in recent decades to building affordable homes. Boughton makes a strong case that public housing\u2014like Britain\u2019s public health service\u2014is a valuable good that merits greater investment, both financial and imaginative. He writes, \u201cThe form and nature of public housing has been unfairly blamed for problems entrenched in our unequal society and exacerbated by the politics which reflect it\u201d\u2014an observation as true in the United States as it is in the United Kingdom. \u2014Rebecca Mead", "\u201cStill Here: The Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch,\u201d by Alexandra Jacobs", "In 1964, the actress Elaine Stritch\u2019s blazing path through the New York theatre scene hit a rough patch: she was drinking too much champagne; she was lonely; she wasn\u2019t booking Broadway jobs like she used to. So she decided to take a year off. According to Stritch\u2019s biographer, Alexandra Jacobs, her first plan was to unravel her reputation as a lush by finally, at thirty-nine years old, taking up hobbies that were healthy\u2014bicycling, learning to play piano. But the call of New York night life was too loud. When a scene-y restaurant named Elaine\u2019s opened on the Upper East Side, Stritch began to haunt it; several show-biz folk began to joke that it was named for her. (The actual namesake was the proprietress, Elaine Kaufman.) One night, a bartender called in sick, and a customer ordered a brandy stinger. Stritch, announcing that this was her specialty, leapt behind the bar, where she stayed on for several months, razzing celebrity guests (Shelley Winters, Toots Shor, Jackie Gleason) and regaling patrons with the kind of warts-and-all backstage tales that she would later turn into the bravura monologue \u201cElaine Stritch: At Liberty.\u201d Sparkling details such as these clink around Jacobs\u2019s biography, \u201cStill Here,\u201d like ice in a rocks glass. Stritch, who died in 2014, was a true character, \u201cfull of piss and vinegar,\u201d as Gleason said. It would be possible to write a serviceable book about her life by simply quoting her many one-liners, or by describing her habit of wearing only tights on stage. But Jacobs, an editor of the Styles section of the New York Times, doesn\u2019t rely on Stritch\u2019s charm to fuel the narrative. Instead, she uses hundreds of interviews and years of research to portray the actress in all her complexity. Stritch was a star but a pill, a life force with a self-destructive streak, a mesmerizing presence who also tended to push away those closest to her. The one time I met her, she yelled at me. I considered it an honor. \u2014Rachel Syme"]}
