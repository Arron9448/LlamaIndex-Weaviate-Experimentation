Both immune responses help provide lasting protection after vaccination, but antibody responses are easier to measure.", "William James, a professor of virology at the University of Oxford, and his colleagues took blood samples from people who had recovered from Covid-19, and health workers who had received either one or two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. They also obtained isolates of the B117 and B1.351 virus variants first identified in Kent and South Africa, and of an older variant similar to those circulating a year ago. Antibodies and T cells from the individuals were then tested against these viruses to see how well they performed.", "The study, which has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, found that people\u2019s antibodies were moderately effective against the original virus after their first dose of vaccine, less effective against the Kent variant, and were unable to neutralise the South African variant.", "However, they had strong T-cell responses against all known variants after the first jab. \u201cIt may not necessarily protect you against infection, but it\u2019s very likely that this first dose will make it much easier for your immune system to make a good response the next time around,\u201d said James. \u201cWe think this is why that second dose produces such a good strong antibody response, because the T cells are already there, ready to react.\u201d", "The discovery that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and those who have received at least one dose of vaccine possess T cells capable of responding to the new variants is encouraging, because it suggests the T cells are recognising different regions of the spike protein to the antibodies. It could imply they will be more resilient to future variants. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t promise you won\u2019t get ill from the new variants, but it does suggest there\u2019s something to work from and that your immune system can respond to them,\u201d said James.", "People\u2019s antibody responses were also boosted by the second Pfizer jab. \u201cIn more than 90% of cases, the antibodies that people are generating after the second dose are up at the sort of level that neutralises the virus and which we would expect to protect them from infection,\u201d said James. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that they\u2019ll be protected from infection by the South African strain and the Kent strain, as well as the [original] strain of the virus.", "\u201cThis virus hasn\u2019t finished evolving, but I think that as long as the vaccines get rolled out, and people get those second doses, we\u2019re going to be in a much better position by the summer than we are now,\u201d said James.", "Deborah Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cIt does look like good news and suggests it is really important that people go back for their second dose of vaccine.\u201d", "Prof Paul Morgan, the director of the Systems Immunity Research Institute at Cardiff University, said: \u201cI was supportive of the pragmatic decision to delay second doses to get more people immunised as quickly as possible and I still am. However, this work shows that the broad immune response needed to deal with current and future variants of concern is really dependent on boosting.", "\u201cI think that the message is to get the second doses going as soon as possible \u2013 perhaps as soon as the high-risk groups have all had first doses, which means pretty soon.\u201d", "The findings also shed light on the risk of reinfection with new variants for people who have already recovered from Covid-19. T-cell activity was detected in all of them, but there was widespread variation in their antibody responses. \u201cIn the best responders, you could still measure some neutralisation against even the South African strain, but those who had rather weaker responses had no neutralisation activity,\u201d said James. \u201cIt shows it\u2019s really important to get vaccinated, even if you\u2019ve think you\u2019ve recovered from the virus.\u201d", "Although they did not look at immune responses from people injected with other types of Covid-19 vaccines, James suspects they will generate similar immune responses.", "Morgan said: \u201cThe findings add to the growing confidence that the current vaccines will have a large impact on the course of the pandemic, whether by completely protecting from or markedly ameliorating disease.\u201d"], "authors": ["Linda Geddes"], "keywords": ["variants", "dose", "immune", "antibodies", "doses", "vaccine", "strong", "south", "second", "covid", "cells", "pfizer", "responses", "response"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
