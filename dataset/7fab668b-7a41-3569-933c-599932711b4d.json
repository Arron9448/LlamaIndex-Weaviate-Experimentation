There\u2019s no way we can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel safe doing that, because there are so many people travelling to the same place from around the world. We have our place in Bristol and live alone. I think it\u2019s completely necessary to quarantine and I don\u2019t mind doing it there at all. But I\u2019m a student \u2013 there\u2019s no chance we can pay.\u201d", "She was supposed to return to the UK from visiting her family in mid-January, but her flight was cancelled due to the ban.", "\u201cThere are no flights for the next two weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no idea when we\u2019ll be able to go back home. The UK put Chile on a list with the rest of South America, assuming the whole region had the Brazilian variant, but Chile has only detected a few cases. We were shocked when we were placed on the high-risk list.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d she added. \u201cOur families are great and we\u2019re lucky to have a place to crash, but the anxiety level is quite high not knowing when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d", "\u2018We\u2019ve spent the savings we would have used for our honeymoon\u2019", "Steven Fleck with his fiancee and their son. Photograph: Steven Fleck/Guardian Community", "Similarly Steven Fleck and his family have been stuck in Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands, since the start of the third UK national lockdown in early January because their airline has repeatedly cancelled their return flights.", "\u201cThe most recent flight on 2 March has just been cancelled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next one, fingers crossed, is the 6 March. I\u2019m not holding my breath for it to be honest.\u201d", "Fleck, his fiancee, Libby, their son and his parents-in-law arrived on the island for a five-week holiday on 6 December, just six days before the Canary Islands were removed from the UK government\u2019s safe travel list, meaning travellers would have to self-isolate on their return.", "The extended stay has incurred substantial costs. \u201cWe\u2019re in our third hotel now because the other ones have closed until the summer months. For just myself and my partner, staying in this apartment, and two villas before that has got to be about \u00a34,000. Food on top of that I\u2019d estimate to be another \u00a31,000. We are penny watching for sure.", "\u201cIronically, we were due to get married last year, and that was cancelled twice. So we\u2019ve spent the savings we would have used for our honeymoon to help fund staying here longer.\u201d", "Fleck said travelling back to the UK indirectly was both too expensive and too risky, especially when their airline has not addressed whether they might be compensated for the additional costs incurred from their already cancelled flights.", "He is also concerned about his business in the UK. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own events company. I\u2019ve only got one employee left now who\u2019s working remotely, and myself. It\u2019s harder to plan ahead harder when you\u2019re in another country. It\u2019s demoralising. We\u2019ve got to get back to our lives.\u201d", "\u2018Travel is almost a privilege now: you have to be rich enough to pay for quarantine\u2019", "Maria, 29, was due to fly back from Portugal, where she has been visiting her family, on 27 January, before her flight was cancelled at short notice. Since then, she has booked another two flights, only for them to be cancelled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty awful experience,\u201d said Maria, who lives in Cambridge. \u201cMy flight was days from departing when the UK suddenly put a ban on flights from Portugal because of the Brazilian variant. The UK government has said that if you have residency you can fly back, and I have pre-settled status, but the flights keep being cancelled.\u201d", "Now, she is considering flying back via a third country if rules allow, but is concerned about the cost of a hotel quarantine should that be necessary.", "\u201cI\u2019m just constantly anxious because I feel like I\u2019m stuck,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any options available to me that don\u2019t require quite a lot of money. I travelled in the summer, and did everything right with the full self-isolation for 14 days. It frustrates me, because travel is almost a privilege now: you have to be rich enough to pay for quarantine.\u201d"], "authors": ["Molly Blackall", "David Batty"], "keywords": ["uk", "quarantine", "overseas", "dont", "costs", "return", "residents", "impossible", "flight", "pay", "flights", "cancelled", "hotel", "rules", "trapped", "stuck"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
