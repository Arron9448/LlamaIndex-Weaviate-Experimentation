machines in the US?\nAnd that's another area where we need voting equipment.\nWe need that for security, sorry,we need it for accuracy and speed,but should we really trust the computer,to tell us who won the election?\nYou have to run an election well,but if the people don't believein the outcome of an election, it's a problem.\nplease register to vote, vote, vote early if you can,but don't amplify messagesthat reduce people's trust in elections.", "paragraphs": ["Transcript", "Hey everyone my name is Lily Hay Newman.", "Can't get rid of me that easily,", "I'm a security reporter with Wired.", "Thanks for being here.", "I'm here with Ben Adida,", "he's the Executive Director of VotingWorks.", "And they're a nonprofit developer", "of open source voting machines and audit software.", "So this is the guy we all really wanna talk to today.", "How are you doing Ben?", "I'm doing really well, how about you Lily?", "I'm good, thanks.", "So you all are developing open source voting machines.", "Why is that important?", "Why is that different?", "What's going on with voting machines right now?", "Yeah I think the really important thing is to start with,", "why do we even need voting machines in the US?", "Why can't we just have a piece of paper,", "circle a candidate, put in the box,", "at the end of the day we make some piles,", "we count them done, right?", "There's two big reasons for that, that are really, yeah.", "[laughing]", "There's two big reasons for that,", "that are really important to highlight.", "The first one is that,", "we need to count ballots in the US,", "that are particularly complex.", "Whereas in France for example,", "you might vote on one contest.", "In the US you vote on 20, 40, sometimes as many as 90,", "and for that we need computers for the speed and accuracy.", "Humans just can't do the job as fast or as accurately.", "And then the second reason,", "so we need equipment to count ballots.", "And then we also need equipment to help", "many millions of voters produce their paper ballot,", "because many millions of voters can't read 10 point font,", "or fill out tiny bubbles.", "And that's another area where we need voting equipment.", "So you asked what do VotingWorks do?", "Well who makes these machines, right.", "These are the foundation of democracy,", "they're the operating system of democracy.", "VotingWorks is the only nonprofit election equipment maker,", "and we think that elections are the foundation of democracy,", "and that foundation should be publicly owned.", "It's for us a question of trust and transparency.", "So what are some other efforts this year", "or things that are going to be different", "in the 2020 election,", "that are sort of other movements in this direction", "of verifiability and accountability?", "I think the most important", "election security story of 2020,", "is not the one you're thinking of,", "it's risk-limiting audits.", "And I know that's a mouthful,", "but I wanna explain it", "because it is a giant success of election security", "and we should be talking about it more.", "And that is, I just mentioned,", "we need computers to tabulate our votes, right.", "We need that for security, sorry,", "we need it for accuracy and speed,", "but should we really trust the computer,", "to tell us who won the election?", "And of course answer is no, we need to audit it in some way.", "And we want the speed and accuracy of computers,", "and we want the trust and verifiability,", "of the multi-parts and group of humans,", "checking individual balance.", "Risk-limiting audits square that circle,", "they allowed us to get both.", "The computers do the tabulation quickly and accurately,", "and then humans get together,", "and through a rigorous statistical method,", "look at a small sample of those ballots", "to confirm the work of the tabulators.", "A state can typically do this in one or two days,", "so before results are certified", "and get a much higher level of security", "and integrity for that election.", "The crazy thing about risk-limiting audits is,", "we haven't done this kind of rigorous statistical stuff.", "We never did it until 2017,", "that's the first time that happened.", "Which means this election, 2020,", "is the first time we're running", "this kind of rigorous statistical audit,", "in a presidential election in the US.", "And the wonderful news is, that we expect to see", "five to eight States this year,", "up from zero, four years ago,", "do this kind of rigorous statistical audit,", "and VotingWorks is really proud to be making the software", "that's going to run almost all of those audits", "for states this year.", "Yeah well, up from zero, it's a really impressive number", "and it sounds like it's gonna be a big contribution", "in this election when there's so much going on,", "we could say.", "So on that note, you know I think we should talk about", "vote by mail a little bit.", "Yeah.", "You know, we're just hearing", "so much conflicting information", "about vote by mail and absentee by mail voting,", "and all these different phrases,", "including in the presidential debate last night.", "Can you talk a little bit about fraud in vote by mail?", "What's the concern there?", "So the bottom line is that if you talk", "to election security experts,", "including me but not just including me,", "vote by mail fraud is simply not a major concern.", "If you look at the data,", "it happens occasionally, it usually gets caught,", "it doesn't happen at the scale", "that would ever come close to impacting", "the outcome of an election.", "And so the discussion of vote by mail fraud", "is much to do about nothing.", "I think the more important conversation about vote by mail,", "is how COVID has obviously forced states", "to significantly step up their game on vote by mail.", "And for many states it's a pretty significant change.", "And that change means we're gonna see some hiccups, right.", "Expect to see some hiccups around this,", "just like you're seeing hiccups", "in every other aspect of your life around COVID-19.", "But the thing to remember,", "is the election officials around the country", "from both parties, are working so incredibly hard", "to make this work, they're are the true heroes here.", "Just remember that, when you're criticizing elections", "or how they're run like they're your friends,", "they're your neighbors, they're helping democracy", "and they're working seven days a week,", "long days to make this work.", "There will be some small hiccups,", "but vote by mail is safe.", "If that's how you wanna vote, request your ballot,", "vote at home, send it in.", "If you prefer to drop it off,", "if your state allows that, go ahead and drop it off.", "do it as early as you can", "that will help your election officials", "process all the ballots,", "in states where they're allowed to process them early,", "that's what you can do to help.", "And if you wanna vote in person, do that too.", "Sorry, don't do that too,", "do that or vote by mail, don't do both.", "And come in, vote, wear a mask, socially distance,", "follow the instructions, make sure your voice is heard.", "And don't worry about vote by mail fraud,", "it's not a significant concern.", "And to your point about all the hard work", "that election officials put in,", "if and when there's a delay in getting results", "on election day and after election day,", "what should we assume is happening during that time?", "You know is that all election officials", "just like forging all the ballots and going on vacation,", "or what's gonna be happening in those weeks.", "First of all, election officials", "aren't gonna be going on vacation", "until probably late December", "between all the work they're doing,", "because what they're gonna do after election day", "is what they've done every year,", "which is make sure they got all the ballots,", "make sure all the ballots are counted,", "make sure that if there's any close election", "they follow any auditing procedure they have.", "For some of the States,", "they're gonna be running", "those risk-limiting audits we talked about.", "And so, the thing to understand is,", "while we are accustomed to election results", "declared on election night,", "although as we know, not all the time right.", "Election 2000 was one recent example", "where the result wasn't known on election night.", "The official results have never been known,", "until three weeks after the election.", "The time it takes to make sure all the ballots are counted,", "including military ballots", "that sometimes come in a little bit later, right.", "But also including vote by mail ballots", "that are coming in a couple days after the election,", "in states where you're allowed to send them", "up until the day of the election.", "These are valid votes and we should count them all,", "and it might take a few days", "and because there's so much more vote by mail this year,", "there might be enough unknown on election night", "because those ballots are still coming in", "and being counted,", "that maybe we won't declare a winner", "on election night and that's okay.", "That's not any different", "than anything we've ever done before,", "it's just we have a little bit more vote by mail", "and so getting those votes counted,", "will take a few more days and that's okay.", "But your election officials", "are not gonna be on vacation for a while,", "they got work to do.", "Yeah definitely not.", "My last question for you Ben is,", "you know, why is misinformation", "or all this confusion about the voting process", "so problematic, and why is it so important", "for us to talk about?", "So two days ago, it's a great question,", "it's a really important question.", "Two days ago the FBI and the Department of Homeland security", "issued a warning about election security and integrity.", "And it wasn't about hacked voting machines,", "and it wasn't about vote by mail.", "It was specifically about disinformation", "that reduces people's trust in election integrity.", "And the reason that's important", "is because democracy only works if we believe in it.", "You have to run an election well,", "but if the people don't believe", "in the outcome of an election, it's a problem.", "And so the biggest attack", "and the biggest concern I have this year,", "is not around any of this", "vote by mail fraud, that isn't a problem,", "hacked voting machines", "which we should be worried about", "but also there's no evidence it's happening.", "The biggest concern I have", "is that a lot of well meaning folks out there", "who care about democracy,", "are gonna see an alarmist story on their Twitter feed,", "or in their Facebook feed", "or I don't think they have it on Instagram", "but maybe on Instagram too,", "and they're gonna say,", "I need to tell my friends about this,", "this is important, I'm gonna retweet or share,", "and in the process become an unwitting participant", "in this misinformation game,", "of reducing people's trust in an election outcome.", "please register to vote, vote, vote early if you can,", "but don't amplify messages", "that reduce people's trust in elections.", "Because if you do, if we lose faith in democracy,", "we lose democracy.", "All right it's a chilling warning.", "Thank you so much for joining us Ben.", "Thanks lily great to chat."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["wired25", "trustworthy", "theyre", "adida", "really",
