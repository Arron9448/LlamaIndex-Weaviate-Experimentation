They are later joined by Monica\u2019s mother, portrayed by industry veteran and national treasure Youn Yuh-Jung, whom Han affectionately refers to as sunsaeng-nim, the Korean word for \u201cteacher.\u201d \u201cAmong the crew, there were non-Korean immigrants and children of immigrants,\u201d Han recalls. \u201cThey said that even though they couldn\u2019t understand a thing\u201d\u2014much of the film is in Korean\u2014\u201cthey still understood everything.\u201d", "Of the five main characters, Monica struggles the most with life in Arkansas. \u201cJacob found his dream in America. Monica didn\u2019t have a dream; she simply came with him because of love,\u201d Han says. She drew from stories of immigrant wives in the \u201970s and \u201980s, particularly of Korean women who left their own families behind, never to rejoin them, and were expected to be subsumed by their husbands\u2019 families. The character initially existed only as loose brushstrokes in Chung\u2019s script. But with Chung\u2019s encouragement, Han fleshed out the role into something powerful yet restrained, calling upon the shape of her mother, her aunt, and her grandmother. \u201cShe is so talented and honest, and was able to communicate the depth, resilience, and power of Monica,\u201d says Yeun. \u201cShe was always truthful as an actor, and I had ultimate trust in her.\u201d The film, which is based partially on Chung\u2019s life growing up on a farm in Arkansas, took home both the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and the U.S. Dramatic Audience Award at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. But it was Chung\u2019s father\u2019s appreciation of her performance that stuck with Han. \u201cThat was the most meaningful,\u201d she says.", "Yeri Han in a scene from Minari.

When asked if she plans to capitalize on Minari\u2019s success and shift her own home to the States, she shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to plan too much.
