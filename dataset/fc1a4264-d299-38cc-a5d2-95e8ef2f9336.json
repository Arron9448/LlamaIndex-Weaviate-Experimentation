What would normally have been a dry, corporate affair was being watched more closely than usual: SoftBank\u2019s technology-investing arm, the Vision Fund, had recently seen some of its investments turn sour. Son, who wore a dark suit and a mauve tie, sat poker-faced during the introductory remarks and then walked to a lectern. \u201cThe earnings-results announcement is not good at all,\u201d he said, in the words of a translator. \u201cIt\u2019s a big negative.\u201d The conglomerate reported that the value of its investment in WeWork, the office-sharing company, had decreased by more than eight billion dollars. \u201cI want you to look at this picture,\u201d he said, pointing to a screen that depicted an image of churning ocean waves. \u201cWe are, actually, in a rough sea.\u201d", "Since 2017, SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund\u2014which has a hundred billion dollars, making it the world\u2019s largest tech fund\u2014has been making aggressive, market-altering investments in some of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known companies. (Two of its largest investors are the governments of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.) Its portfolio includes some successes, such as the Indian Internet-commerce company Flipkart and the medical-testing company Guardant Health. But recently, the high points have been overshadowed by several major setbacks. The fund invested several billion dollars in Uber, in 2018, but, in the months since the company went public, in May, its stock value has quickly declined. Slack, another Vision Fund investment, went public in June and is also trading well below its initial valuation. The company\u2019s highest-profile disaster is WeWork, which, in September, withdrew its plans for an I.P.O. after its founder, Adam Neumann, resigned amid scandal.", "The Vision Fund\u2019s investment approach is somewhat unique. Son\u2019s plan had been to pour so much money into his target companies that they were practically drowning in capital; this would equip the companies, the thinking went, to overwhelm their competitors and achieve primacy in their markets. In one instance, recounted in the Wall Street Journal, the Vision Fund insisted that a dog-walking-app company called Wag accept a three-hundred-million-dollar investment, even though it had only been seeking seventy-five million dollars in funding. (The investment has not worked out as Son hoped, and Wag\u2019s executives are now trying to find a buyer for the company.) Son attempted to employ this strategy on a much larger scale with WeWork; the Vision Fund invested more than ten billion dollars in the company ahead of its planned I.P.O.", "The company\u2019s I.P.O. filings became public in August, exposing it to intense public scrutiny. The documents revealed ethical lapses and problems with governance, all of which SoftBank had apparently overlooked. Neumann appeared to have been running the company largely for personal enrichment, installing family members in key positions and buying buildings on his own and then leasing them back to WeWork. In one of the most egregious examples, which occurred after he changed the firm\u2019s name to the We Company, Neumann trademarked the word \u201cWe\u201d and then directed the company to compensate him with nearly six million dollars in stock to use it. (He later reversed the transaction in response to public criticism.) The I.P.O. was withdrawn, and the company was on track to run out of money, when, in October, SoftBank agreed to invest an additional nine and a half billion dollars in order to keep it alive.", "Much attention has been paid to Neumann\u2019s frat-boy behavior, and how he was able to persuade sophisticated bankers and venture capitalists such as Son to give him huge sums of money with few conditions. But the larger story may be the far-reaching economic effects of SoftBank\u2019s investment strategy. The fact that the Vision Fund flooded its companies with capital made it difficult for other startups or traditional companies with even a modicum of fiscal discipline to compete. \u201cWhat SoftBank is trying to do is basically break the rules of capitalism,\u201d Matt Stoller, the author of the recent book \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\u201d told me. \u201cThey finance entities that provide goods and services for lower than their cost. That was the model Amazon used, with the idea that at some point in the future they would be able to raise prices or find some other way to make money to cover their losses. That\u2019s what you do when there are no rules against predatory pricing\u2014you\u2019re pricing to acquire market power.\u201d The problem for these companies and their investors is that, often, a time arrives when making a business out of selling your products at a loss no longer works. As Stoller put it, \u201cInvestors realize, either you turn it into a monopoly, and you start harvesting, or you realize you can\u2019t turn it into a monopoly, because there are no barriers to entry.\u201d", "In the nineteen-seventies, the U.S. had rules against predatory pricing. \u201cThe laws were designed to protect the functioning of capital and markets,\u201d Stoller said. When a company operates normally, \u201cpeople take a bunch of inputs and combine them into something that is worth more than the initial inputs. Take rubber and metal and other materials, and you turn it into a car, and the car is worth more than the initial materials. That\u2019s why in the aggregate we get wealthy; we take stuff and make it into something that is worth more.\u201d In the nineteen-eighties, the push for deregulation and the weakening of predatory-pricing laws gained momentum. This encouraged executives to try to grow their businesses first and worry about whether they might be profitable later. \u201cWhat ends up happening is you take a bunch of inputs and you\u2019re turning it into something less than your inputs,\u201d Stoller said. Like Amazon, Netflix and Uber were granted enormous leeway by investors, and have posted losses for years while trying to kill off competitors. In the case of Amazon, the strategy worked, and the company now holds a de-facto monopoly on online retail. For Netflix and Uber, the outcome isn\u2019t yet known. But the widespread use of this strategy has prompted experts to worry that we are in the middle of a tech bubble.", "Son is now faced with the task of taking WeWork\u2019s inputs and trying to combine them into a more valuable output. \u201cMy judgment was not right in many ways,\u201d he said in Tokyo, looking into the cameras. \u201cI regret it.\u201d The near-collapse of WeWork came at an inopportune time for Son, who recently announced plans to raise money for a second, similarly ambitious Vision Fund that would rival the size of the first. Whether or not he succeeds, the imprint that Son has left on the broader economy will remain."]}
