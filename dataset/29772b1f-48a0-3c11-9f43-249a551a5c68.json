Number 63 rue de Monceau had belonged to a banker called Mo\u00efse de Camondo; his wife Ir\u00e8ne, the daughter of another banking family, had as a girl been painted by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, her red hair tied with a blue ribbon. In wealthy middle-age Camondo had torn down the house his parents built when they emigrated to Paris from Constantinople, and sold or given away everything they brought with them, even the precious Judaica.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

He bequeathed the building and all its contents to the nation, with instructions that it be opened as a museum, and that nothing inside should be lent or changed, nor anything added.", "Camondo\u2019s daughter, B\u00e9atrice, was given Renoir\u2019s portrait of her mother as a wedding gift. She was among those who gathered in 1936 for the museum\u2019s grand opening. The Mus\u00e9e Nissim de Camondo was named after her brother, who had been killed fighting for his country in the first world war. It proved so popular that soon the opening hours were extended.", "In \u201cThe Hare with Amber Eyes\u201d (2010), Edmund de Waal recounted how his father\u2019s family, the Ephrussis, had built their own house on rue de Monceau, a few doors from their friends, the Camondos. In a series of imaginary missives to Mo\u00efse, Mr de Waal\u2019s slim new book, \u201cLetters to Camondo\u201d, brings to life the milieu of 19th-century upper-middle-class French Jewry, with its peculiar mix of inner wariness and dynastic chutzpah. In \u201cThe House of Fragile Things\u201d, James McAuley sets the aesthetic created by the Ephrussis, Camondos, Reinachs and their Rothschild cousins in historical context. Together they form a moving portrait of a glittering, doomed world\u2014of which both the house and Renoir\u2019s painting are poignant emblems.", "Children of the revolution", "During its revolution France became the second European nation (500 years after Poland) to emancipate its Jewish population. Sophisticated families like the Camondos may have had relations across Europe and the Mediterranean, but many embraced the republic and French citizenship with passion. They served in parliament or supported France\u2019s most beloved cultural institutions. As Mr McAuley puts it, they were \u201cthe careful architects of an identity that sought to present Frenchness and Jewishness as symbiotic, and perhaps even as natural extensions of each other\u201d.", "The revolution had prised France\u2019s great art holdings out of the hands of the king and the aristocracy, so that in the 19th century collecting became a bourgeois affair. The collections of well-off Jewish families \u201cbore special significance\u201d, Mr McAuley says. They filled their homes with quintessentially French objects: Savonnerie carpets, Chardin engravings, the opulent cabinet-making of the master \u00e9b\u00e9niste Jean-Henri Riesner. Camondo had a weakness for anything of royal provenance, especially from the reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. \u201cThese collections function as self-portraits,\u201d Mr McAuley writes.", "Yet these same collectors might have known an ominous Yiddish phrase: Frankraykh frest yidn (\u201cFrance devours Jews\u201d). The republic may sometimes have upheld the revolution\u2019s values and embraced ardent adherents like the Camondos, but prejudice always shadowed the idealism. Anti-Semitism, sometimes a whisper, sometimes a shout, was perennial\u2014not only among the rabid pamphleteers who supported the bogus conviction of the Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus, but among the very artists who numbered these families among their greatest patrons. Of the substantial payment he received for painting Ir\u00e8ne and (separately) her two sisters, Renoir wrote: \u201cI have to say I find it stingy.\u201d", "For French Jews, Mr McAuley says, the story\u2019s ending \u201chas always overshadowed the beginning and the middle\u201d. Within weeks of France\u2019s fall in 1940 Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring was determined to seize as much of its great art as he could for himself and Adolf Hitler. One of the first paintings he took was Renoir\u2019s portrait of Ir\u00e8ne, by then hanging in her daughter B\u00e9atrice\u2019s apartment in Neuilly. As Mr de Waal explains\u2014in a book that blends historical research with literary ruminations\u2014Frau Emmy G\u00f6ring found the picture enchanting. The Reichsmarschall chose it for his private collection.", "G\u00f6ring appointed Bruno Lohse, one of \u201cthe most prodigious art plunderers in history\u201d, in the words of Jonathan Petropoulos in \u201cG\u00f6ring\u2019s Man in Paris\u201d, to oversee the wholesale theft and redistribution of more than 30,000 other art works, mostly from the private collections of French Jews.Not since Napoleon\u2019s foray into Italy had so much European art been stolen to order. After the war it would take decades to be restituted, notes Mr Petropoulos, in a book that underscores the vulnerability of France\u2019s Jewish collectors. Some works have never been found.", "Although the Camondos and other 19th-century Jewish immigrants could not foresee the future, hindsight imbues their anxieties about belonging with tragedy. Ir\u00e8ne survived the war (as did the museum named after her son). Eventually she recovered, then sold, the portrait of her much younger self. As Mr de Waal notes, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, France\u2019s collaborationist leader during the Occupation, personally intervened to save a friend of B\u00e9atrice\u2019s\u2014along with just two other French Jews.", "With the help of some of their compatriots, around 80,000 others were murdered. B\u00e9atrice herself was among them. A convert to Catholicism, she wanted to believe that her wealth and dedication to the republic and the Virgin Mary would save her family. Yet less than a decade after the Mus\u00e9e Nissim de Camondo was left to the country, she, her two children and their father were arrested and sent to Auschwitz; they all perished. Her death certificate says she died for France. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["collectors", "tragedy", "waal", "house", "frances", "camondos", "jewish", "art", "french", "camondo", "mcauley", "mr", "paris", "prewar"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
