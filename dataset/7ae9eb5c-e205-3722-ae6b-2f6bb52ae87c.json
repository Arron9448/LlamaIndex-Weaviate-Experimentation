I've been backpacking for 20 years now and the sense of connection, humanity and curiosity never ends no matter how old I get.\"", "One of the many appeals to this type of travel is affordability. Backpackers can bed down in hostel dormitories for a fraction of the price of hotels, and the growth of low-cost carriers helped to open things up for those who had previously seen travel as out of their reach financially.", "But with airlines set to see combined losses of $157 billion in 2020 and 2021, according to the International Air Transport Association, the cheap flights that many backpackers rely on could soon become a thing of the past.", "Such requirements will likely end up being rather costly for those planning to visit multiple destinations where tests aren't provided free of charge.", "Related content We went backpacking with suitcases in Italy and it was a mess", "The backpacker buck", "Around 45 million backpacking trips are taken every year according to WYSE Travel Confederation.
