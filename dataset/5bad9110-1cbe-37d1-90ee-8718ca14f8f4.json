The symbols help the dozens of participating parties to differentiate themselves from one another, while making it easier for voters to make their choice in a country where around a quarter of the population is illiterate.", "But although it's common for party symbols to represent values or ideologies, India's system differs in an important way: Rather than designing logos themselves, parties must instead choose from a pre-existing list controlled by election officials.", "An attendee wearing clothing featuring the Indian National Congress (INC) party logo at an event in New Delhi, India, on March 11, 2019.
