It didn't stay modest for long.", "From the opening a new three-story main building in 1899 to a huge overhaul in 2019 (and numerous makeovers in between), Raffles Hotel has become the signature example of colonial architecture in Singapore.

It is now a peaceful oasis by day and a bustling entertainment center at night.", "But the standout structure is the complex's Gothic chapel, which features a five-story spire and flying buttresses.
