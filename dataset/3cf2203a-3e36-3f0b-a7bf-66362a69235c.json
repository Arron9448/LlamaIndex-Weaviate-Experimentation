They head back north and stay off the coast of California in spring and summer to feed on anchovies, sardines and krill before continuing on their northerly migration to cool, food-rich Arctic waters.", "In 2019, at least 13 dead whales washed ashore in the Bay Area and scientists said they feared it was because the animals were starving and couldn\u2019t complete their annual migration from Mexico to Alaska. Biologists have observed gray whales in poor body condition during their annual migration since 2019, when an \u201cunusual mortality event\u201d was declared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).", "Malnutrition, entanglement in fishing gear, and trauma from ship strikes have been the most common causes of death found by the center\u2019s research team in recent years.", "Gray whales in Baja California, where they mate and give birth before heading north.
