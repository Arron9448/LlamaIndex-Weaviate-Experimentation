Photograph: Beth Garrabrant", "\u201cI\u2019ve decided to add songs from the vault, which are songs that almost made the original Fearless album, but I\u2019ve now gone back and recorded those so that everyone will be able to hear not only the songs that made the album but the songs that almost made it \u2013 the full picture.\u201d", "The artwork to the original release of Fearless. Photograph: PR Handout", "The original recording of Fearless won the Grammy award for album of the year in 2010, at the time making Swift the youngest recipient of the prize. Fans have deduced from one of the star\u2019s cryptic social media posts that the rerecorded version will be released on 9 April.", "Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) is faithful to the sound of the original production, a representative said. No personnel have been confirmed. The original album was produced by Nathan Chapman.", "It is assumed that Swift\u2019s hardcore fanbase will forsake the original recordings of her first six albums in favour of the new versions, as a show of support for her battle to own her own music.", "In November 2018, the musician announced that she had left Big Machine, the label where she started her career, for Universal Music Group, in a deal that would give her ownership of any music she recorded for the label.", "The following year, Big Machine sold Swift\u2019s first six albums to music manager Scooter Braun. The deal \u201cstripped me of my life\u2019s work\u201d, Swift said at the time, claiming that she was not given the same option to buy back her recordings that was offered to Braun, whom Swift said had subjected her to years of \u201cincessant, manipulative bullying\u201d as manager of Kanye West, her longtime antagonist.", "Big Machine CEO Scott Borchetta said that Swift had been offered the chance to own the masters of her first six albums \u2013 from her self-titled 2006 debut to 2017\u2019s Reputation \u2013 if she had signed a new 10-year deal with the label.", "In November 2020, Braun put Swift\u2019s catalogue up for sale. She said that Braun had asked her to sign a non-disclosure agreement before she was allowed to \u201cbid on my own work\u201d, leading her lawyers to raise red flags.", "\u201cMy legal team said that this is absolutely not normal, and they\u2019ve never seen an NDA like this presented unless it was to silence an assault accuser by paying them off,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would never even quote my team a price. These master recordings were not for sale to me.\u201d", "Investment firm Shamrock Holdings bought Swift\u2019s catalogue for a rumoured $300m. The pop star indicated that Braun was still involved with Shamrock, which prevented the possibility of her collaboration. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame to know that I will now be unable to help grow the future of these past works and it pains me very deeply to remain separated from the music I spent over a decade creating, but this is a sacrifice I will have to make to keep Scooter Braun out of my life.\u201d", "She said at the time that she had already begun rerecording her old music, which had \u201calready proven to be both exciting and creatively fulfilling\u201d. She has promised \u201cplenty of surprises\u201d across the rerecorded albums.", "It remains to be seen whether industry giants such as streaming platforms, radio programmers and music supervisors for film and television will follow Swift\u2019s fans in supporting the newly released music over the original recordings. Swift is an industry unto herself: her eighth studio album, Folklore, was the biggest-selling album of 2020 in the US, and the only album to sell more than 1m copies.", "But Braun represents fellow industry behemoths Ariana Grande, J Balvin and Justin Bieber as well as West, and Big Machine is home to leading country artists Florida Georgia Line, Sheryl Crow and Tim McGraw, raising the stakes in these already heavily weighted industry relationships.", "In a statement posted to Twitter, Swift wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken a lot about why I\u2019m remaking my first six albums, but the way I\u2019ve chosen to do this will hopefully help illuminate where I\u2019m coming from. Artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really knows that body of work.\u201d"], "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "keywords": ["braun", "version", "fearless", "swift", "album", "taylor", "recordings", "start", "releasing", "albums", "original", "music", "swifts", "songs", "versions"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
