He gets English football. He always has done. You only have to see that from the teams he has put out in the League Cup and the FA Cup. It would have been very easy for him not to bring Gareth Bale on but he did it because he respects what we have achieved in the competition. I have so much respect for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Tottenham Hotspur as a football club from this.", "\u201cHe has done what he said he would do with his team selection, he brought on players he could have easily left on the bench and Tottenham as a club have supported us wholeheartedly. Over 30,000 virtual tickets have now been sold for this match which is just phenomenal. I want to give a big shout out to the whole football community for that. The Tottenham fans have got right behind that so a big thank you to everyone from Marine Football Club. This will set us up for a long time. I have so much admiration for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club after today.\u201d", "The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.", "Mourinho was impressed by Dele Alli\u2019s display at Rossett Park and insisted Marine had done themselves proud with their display. The Spurs manager said: \u201cSince 2004 I have been in England and I\u2019ve never played against a side at this level in the pyramid but many times played against League One or League Two sides. I\u2019m not English but I know what this means for everyone so I brought a good team, not just for the result but also for the meaning of the Cup. For them I think it is incredible to have Gareth Bale playing here, Moussa Sissoko and all these guys. I think it is an incredible feeling for them. They compete and the result is not one to be ashamed of so everyone goes home happy.\u201d", "Crawley's second-half treble stuns Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds in FA Cup Read more", "Hundreds of people gathered outside the stadium before kick off in defiance of social distancing measures.
