But the country's total was at its lowest since 2013, according to the CTBUH's annual report on global building trends.", "The data presents a stark contrast to 2018, when China set a new record for the most skyscrapers ever built by a country in a single year.", "Rather than singling out one reason for the drop, editor-in-chief of the CTBUH's journal, Daniel Safarik, pointed to myriad shifts in the country's political and economic climate.", "\"Through the course of the year, everyone's been talking about storm clouds forming over Asia, particularly China,\" said Safarik, who co-authored the report, in a phone interview. \"That has been on the cards for a little while.

Take Tianjin, for instance, which is responsible for this year's tallest skyscraper -- the 530-meter (1,739-foot) Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, now the world's eighth highest. Here, there is a city-wide office vacancy rate of over 44%, according to data published by the real estate and investment firm CBRE, although the firm's head of research for Greater China, Ada Choi, said in an email to CNN that there is \"great variation in vacancy\" around the country.", "This year's drop in new completions may also reflect changing official attitudes towards tall building projects. It could, Safarik suggested, signal less appetite for using landmark skyscrapers to put smaller cities on the map or spread investment away from dominant coastal areas.", "Given that tall buildings take years to complete, the fall may even represent the belated impact of Xi Jinping's ascent more than six years ago. As early as 2014, the Chinese president has indicated that his government is concerned with the size and shape of buildings emerging from China's construction boom, later calling for an end to \"oversized, xenocentric, weird\" structures.", "\"There may have been some effort from the top to say 'let's cool things down a bit,'\" Safarik said, adding that many tall buildings in China are \"constructed by or developed by -- or, in some cases, both -- state-owned or heavily state-controlled companies.\"", "Slowing the rate at which towers are built may, therefore, represent a welcome development after years of record-breaking growth, suggested Choi.", "\"Mainland China has already dominated the list of the tallest buildings in the world ... and all of them were completed in the past four years,\" she said.", "\"Considering the time needed to plan, construct and promote a super-tall building, I don't see an issue of having (fewer of them) in the coming years for those cities that already had one recently.\"", "This year, China still completed four times as many 200-meter-plus buildings than the United States, which ranked a distant second.", "The Ping An Finance Center South in Shenzhen, a Chinese city that bucked the national trend to complete 15 new buildings measuring 200 meters or above.
