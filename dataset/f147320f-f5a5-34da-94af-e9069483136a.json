The campaign is about making people aware that if we do this together, we can actually make a huge difference,\" she said.", "A passenger's footprint from an individual flight depends on a number of factors, including how far they fly and how full the plane is, but also on what class they travel in: First class passengers are given more space than economy passengers, meaning they're responsible for a bigger proportion of the plane's emissions.", "Emissions from train travel also depend on many factors, including how the train is powered.
