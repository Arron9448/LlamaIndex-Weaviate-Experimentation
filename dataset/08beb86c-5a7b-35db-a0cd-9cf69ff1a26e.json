Instead, Fox spent the night describing an upside-down world where the president\u2019s enemies had spun a web of lies about Trump and Ukraine, even as Horowitz blew open the base corruption that has driven every attack on the president since 2016.", "Sean Hannity, who had long trumpeted the forthcoming inspector general report and expected a thorough indictment of the behavior of former FBI director James Comey and other members of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d had a simple message for his viewers during Fox\u2019s Monday night prime time: \u201cEverything we said, everything we reported, everything we told you was dead-on-center accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all there in black and white, it\u2019s all there.\u201d", "Except they weren\u2019t right and it wasn\u2019t there. But Fox News\u2019 viewers evidently were not to be told those hard truths\u2014they were to be kept thinking that everything in their self-selected filter bubble was just peachy keen.", "Over on Fox Business, Lou Dobbs said the mere fact that the IG found no political bias in the FBI\u2019s investigation of Trump and Russia in 2016 was de facto proof of the power of the deep state.", "John Harwood, long one of Washington\u2019s most respected conservative voices in journalism, summed up Fox\u2019s approach Monday night simply: \u201cLunacy.\u201d", "It\u2019s worse than lunacy, though. Fox\u2019s bubble reality creates a situation where it\u2019s impossible to have the conversations and debate necessary to function as a democracy. Facts that are inconvenient to President Trump simply disappear down Fox News\u2019 \u201cmemory hole,\u201d as thoroughly as George Orwell could have imagined in 1984.", "The idea that Fox News represents a literal threat to our national security, on par with Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency or China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, may seem like a dramatic overstatement of its own\u2014and I, a paid contributor to its competitor CNN, may appear a biased voice anyway\u2014but this week has made clear that, as we get deeper into the impeachment process and as the 2020 election approaches, Fox News is prepared to destroy America\u2019s democratic traditions if it will help its most important and most dedicated daily viewer.", "The threat posed to our democracy by Fox News is multifaceted: First and most simply, it\u2019s clearly advancing and giving voice to narratives and smears backed and imagined by our foreign adversaries. Second, its overheated and bombastic rhetoric is undermining America\u2019s foundational ideals and the sense of fair play in politics. Third, its unique combination of lies and half-truths has built a virtual reality so complete that it leaves its viewers too misinformed to fulfill their most basic responsibilities as citizens to make informed choices about the direction of the country.", "In the impeachment hearings, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill and other witnesses made clear how those who, like Fox News hosts and the president, advance the false narrative that Ukraine meddled in the US election are serving the Kremlin\u2019s interests. Russia is playing a weak hand geopolitically\u2014its economy is sputtering along and its population shrinking\u2014and so its greatest hope is to stoke internal discord in the West. Robert Mueller warned of this; James Clapper has warned of it; and now Fiona Hill has done the same. \u201cOur nation is being torn apart,\u201d she said. \u201cTruth is questioned.\u201d Yet Fox, and the GOP more broadly, has warmly embraced almost every twist of Kremlin propaganda, up to and including the idea that Russia never meddled in the 2016 election to begin with."], "keywords": ["fox", "election", "2016", "ukraine", "threat", "viewers", "russia", "trump", "president", "security", "national"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Garrett M.
