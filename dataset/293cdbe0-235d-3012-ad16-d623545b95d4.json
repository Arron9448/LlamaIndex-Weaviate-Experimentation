We assume kids should play, but adults? Aren\u2019t we supposed to be mature, responsible grownups?", "That\u2019s how so many of us live, but researchers are now documenting the benefits of play for adults and finding that \u201cplay isn\u2019t just about goofing off; it can also be an important means of reducing stress and contributing to overall well-being,\u201d according to Lynn Barnett, a researcher and professor of recreation, sports and tourism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.", "She added: \u201cHighly playful adults feel the same stressors as anyone else, but they appear to experience and react to them differently, allowing stressors to roll off more easily than those who are less playful.\u201d", "LINK SEEN BETWEEN ADHD AND DIGITAL MEDIA: STUDY", "Barnett's study concluded that playfulness in adults contributes to their resilience, one of the great attributes needed to cope with 21st century demands and stress.", "Let\u2019s be honest: playing feels childish, to me anyway. But I\u2019ve come to see that the practice of play is critical.", "Why? Because it forces us to give up control. Our tendency is to push against the release of control \u2014 control of work, control of relationships, control of family, control of logistics, control of fear, control of whatever.
