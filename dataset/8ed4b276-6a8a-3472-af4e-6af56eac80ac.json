The commission would be tasked with listening to people in crisis and grading the quality of agencies\u2019 work.", "At present, he will say, the stated needs of those requiring help is not sufficiently part of the discussion of humanitarian agencies with the result that bothh people do not get enough of the help they say they want and the money could be more efficiently used. The UN this year hopes to raise $35bn (\u00a325bn).", "\u201cIn Chad and Cox\u2019s Bazar [in Bangladesh] and other places too, people in dire humanitarian need are frequently selling aid they have been given, to buy something else they want more \u2013 a clear indication that what is being provided does not meet people\u2019s needs and preferences.", "\u201cAfter the central Sulawesi earthquake in 2018, almost half of displaced households reported shelter as one of their most important and immediate priorities. Yet only a small fraction of people got immediate help with that.", "\u201cUnfortunately, these are not isolated examples. Last year, more than half the people surveyed in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda said that the aid they received did not cover their most important needs.", "\u201cIn Chad, only 12% of people surveyed were positive about the aid they received.\u201d", "Lowcock admits the need for agencies to be more sensitive to the views of those in need of aid has been part of the development reform agenda for two decades. But there has been limited \u201cpiecemeal\u201d progress, he will say, owing to the lack of any incentive structure for aid agencies to respond.", "\u201cIn many places, we have information on what people want and how they want it. The problem is we are not consistently acting on that information.", "\u201cUltimately, organisations or decision-makers can choose to listen to people and be responsive, or they can choose not to. There are no real consequences for the choice they make. There are weak incentives to push them in the right direction.\u201d", "He will propose an \u201cindependent commission for voices in crises\u201d to hold the system to account and judge whether agencies have listened to those in need.", "\u201cIf we hold such a mirror up to the system, humanitarian agencies collectively will see that we are simply not adequately listening and responding to what people say they want.\u201d", "The results would provide donors with powerful levers with agencies, he will say.", "While his blunt criticism will draw the most attention, Lowcock will stress that transparency is the best route to shoring up confidence in the aid sector. He will argue that humanitarian relief is an absolute necessity, especially as UN appeals have been underfunded by 40% on average over the last five years.", "Lowcock will say this level of underfunding is unsustainable unless the causes of humanitarian need \u2013 famine, displacement, conflict and climate change \u2013 are addressed at the source.", "\u201cToday one in 33 people worldwide needs humanitarian assistance or protection \u2013 more than at any time since the second world war. Almost 80 million people are displaced by conflict and violence.
