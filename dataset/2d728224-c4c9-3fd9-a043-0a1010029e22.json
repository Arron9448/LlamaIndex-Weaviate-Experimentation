On September 28th, in the sweltering heat of the Shizuoka Stadium, the hosts, Japan, beat Ireland, then the second-best team in the world, for the first time ever. The result sparked raucous celebrations around the country. Japanese TV presenters bowed in front of images of the victors before reading the news. The commissioner of the Japan Sports Agency boasted that his country had rewritten sporting history.", "The sport\u2019s bosses are hoping that such standout events will attract more than its usual followers. Rugby and other games are increasingly concerned about their commercial future. Technology allows fans to watch any game at any time from anywhere. That, combined with a growing world population, means that in terms of sheer numbers, sports audiences are bigger than ever. But growth in revenues has slowed, according to P w C , a consultancy. Attention spans are shrinking. The \u201cstickiness\u201d of viewers\u2014the number of minutes of a game that they watch\u2014is dwindling, says Kevin Alavy, the head of Futures Sport, another consultancy. An annual decline of 3% in the number of minutes watched per game per sport per year is common. Sports that drag on for hours, if not days, such as cricket, are particularly vulnerable, as viewers impatiently resort to alternative entertainment on their smartphones\u2014including clips of the highlights. Cricket sells the rights to show such clips separately from those to screen whole matches.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "This pressure is leading to increasingly intense competition between sports for fans\u2019 money and attention. The stakes are high. Sport is a serious business, generating around $90bn a year, reckons Victor Matheson, a sport economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts.", "In America major sports are still extremely valuable to advertisers and pay- TV providers because almost every other type of entertainment offered on television has suffered far worse declines in viewership. MoffettNathanson, a research firm, found in a recent survey of 5,000 Americans that half watched sports at least once a month, and that of those, 90% still subscribe to pay- TV . Only 67% of the respondents who do not watch sports have pay- TV . So while Netflix has eroded pay- TV viewership, the live sporting match remains a draw that is less replaceable\u2014except by other live sporting matches.", "Football remains indisputably the world\u2019s favourite sport. It generates revenues of around $40bn a year, says Mr Matheson, almost twice as much as the next most lucrative sport, American football, five times as much as basketball and 20 times as much as cricket (see chart). Its overall market share has grown since 2000, according to Futures Sport. It is simple to play and easy for fans around the world to follow. FIFA , the sport\u2019s governing body, has invested huge sums of money in emerging markets. The women\u2019s game has galvanised the sport still further; this year\u2019s women\u2019s World Cup was watched by more than a billion viewers. And football\u2019s popularity has soared in China and America, especially among young people.", "No sport will dislodge football. But others can learn from its success. Three big lessons have become apparent. Sports need to adapt to modern viewing habits. They need to break into new markets. Doing so involves more than simply staging matches in new countries\u2014it means finding home-grown stars from these markets.", "No game has reinvented itself for a time-poor age as successfully as cricket. In 2003, a marketing survey saying that people wanted shorter matches led to the launch in England of professional Twenty20 ( T 20 ) cricket. Games last just three hours compared with eight hours for \u201cone-day\u201d cricket and as long as five days for Test matches. T 20 now is the most watched version of cricket worldwide. It appeals to a much younger fan base, explains Mr Alavy. Cricket\u2019s success has been inspirational. Rugby sevens, in which matches consist of two halves lasting seven minutes, compared with the usual 40 minutes, featured in the Olympic games for the first time in 2016. Three-a-side basketball, in which games last ten minutes as opposed to 48 minutes for National Basketball Association ( NBA ) matches, will make its Olympic debut next year.", "Cricket\u2019s reinvention has paid off. Mr Matheson reckons that over the past decade its revenues have grown faster than those of any other big sport. Much of that is thanks to India. The Indian Premier League, the T 20 domestic league in India, is by far the fastest growing major league of any sport, says Mr Matheson. Sports can hope to increase their revenues either by gaining new fans or by relying on existing fans becoming wealthier. Cricket is betting on the latter. India will overtake China as the most populous nation in the world sometime in the 2020s and its middle class is growing fast.", "So central is India to cricket\u2019s calculations that its elimination early in the 2007 cricket World Cup led to the decision to cut the number of teams in the tournament in future from 16 to ten, the lowest of any comparable men\u2019s competition. The team\u2019s premature exit meant that it played just three matches that year. The restructuring means it is guaranteed to play nine in the group stage, a crucial factor in generating cash from broadcasters and advertisers.", "Cricket is unusual in relying so heavily on one market for revenue growth. Most other sports must look farther afield. To start, they can open international tournaments to new players. Since 2002 basketball has doubled the number of teams in the men\u2019s World Cup to 32. Rugby is considering boosting its cup from 20 countries to 24. The rationale is simple: viewership in countries is inevitably higher when they compete in a world cup. \u201cThe more inclusive you make sports, the wider the market is going to be,\u201d says Dave Berri, a sports economist from Southern Utah University. Football is, once again, the world leader in this regard. It recently expanded its World Cup to allow 48 teams to compete. The next women\u2019s cup will include 32 countries, compared with 24 in the most recent one.", "Game on", "Holding such competitions in new markets also helps. Rugby has been cautious, but after taking the 2019 World Cup to Japan\u2014the first time the event has been staged outside the sport\u2019s traditional strongholds\u2014it now intends to hold either the 2027 or 2031 tournament in America. \u201cIt would certainly accelerate some possibilities in that part of the world, which would be good for everyone because the revenue would go back into the game,\u201d Brett Gosper, World Rugby\u2019s boss, recently mused. Basketball\u2019s next World Cup will be held in Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines.", "Sports can venture abroad even without a world cup. The major American leagues in American football, baseball and basketball are all playing regular season matches in London in 2019. They are already attracting crowds beyond homesick Americans. The National Football League says that it sold tickets to one game played in London to every neighbourhood in Britain.", "Such efforts can go alongside squeezed sports\u2019 third gambit\u2014spotting star players in the markets they are eyeing up. These athletes are a powerful recruitment tool, keeping new fans watching. The success of basketball in China\u2014which hosted this year\u2019s World Cup\u2014is a slam-dunk example.", "Basketball\u2019s achievements in China are partly down to one man. In 2002 Yao Ming became the first Chinese player to be the top pick in the NBA draft. That marked the start of a brilliant career in America. Finding a star always involves luck. But the NBA improved its chances through its grassroots work in China. It established offices there as far back as 1992. It has played exhibition games in China since 2004, long before any other professional American sports league.", "The NBA has capitalised on Mr Yao\u2019s popularity and used it to expand basketball\u2019s reach still further. It now has three academies in China, as well as others in Australia, Mexico, India and Senegal. In the past, the league has been \u201cmore passive in terms of the development of that next generation of international players,\u201d said Adam Silver, the head of the NBA , last year. He reckons that if the organisation can nurture outstanding players in such markets, it will increase interest in basketball hugely. The Basketball Africa League, which includes teams from nine African countries, will launch next year as a collaboration between the NBA and FIBA , the global governing body for basketball.", "Such investment helps explain why basketball players in America have become a markedly more international bunch. In 1980 the league had only four foreign players, from just four countries beyond America. By 2000 the league had 36 non-American players, from 24 different countries. It now boasts 108, representing 42 nationalities. The figure remains well short of Premier League football in Britain, whose players hailed from 64 countries last year. But it comfortably outstrips similar leagues in other sports.", "Yet perhaps the biggest lesson of all from the NBA \u2019s success is the extent to which playing a sport makes people watch it. According to its research, the NBA reckons that in newer territories, people who participate in a particular sport are 68 times more likely to be committed fans. There are now 600,000 basketball courts in China, giving players plenty of places to dream of becoming the next Mr Yao.", "Increasing audiences in new markets requires commitment, time and money, says Mr Alavy. Sports that put on one-off matches and hope to gain devoted followers as a result will probably be disappointed. In 2015 a set of T 20 matches between teams captained by Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne, two cricket legends, were staged in America. The organisers claimed these would spark interest in cricket there. In fact, once the tickets had sold, little serious investment went into developing American interest in the sport."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2019/10/05/competition-between-sports-for-fans-money-and-attention-is-increasingly-fierce", "title": "Competition between sports for fans\u2019 money and attention is increasingly fierce", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["attention", "basketball", "money", "world", "competition", "mr", "league", "fierce", "cricket", "matches", "fans", "players", "nba", "increasingly", "sport", "cup"]}
