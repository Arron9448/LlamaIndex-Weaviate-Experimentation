She was shown riding a bus along the Amalfi coast before catching the eye of a passing hunk in a convertible. In 2016 Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, reprised his role as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin in the Star Wars film \u201cRogue One\u201d. Such resurrections are not new, but they are still uncommon enough to count as news. Yet advances in special effects\u2014and, increasingly, in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014are making it ever easier to manufacture convincing forgeries of human beings.", "", "In recent months this has led to concern that propagandists will use the technology to generate videos in which political figures appear to say compromising things. A video created by BuzzFeed, a news website, in April shows Barack Obama apparently saying \u201cWe\u2019re entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time,\u201d for example. In May a Belgian political party produced a fake video of Donald Trump saying implausible things about Belgium\u2019s climate policy. In both cases the video looks slightly off, and the voice is provided by an impersonator. But the technology is improving fast, prompting a dozen AI researchers to place bets on whether a fake video will disrupt America\u2019s midterm elections later this year. (Tim Hwang, a Harvard academic, is overseeing the wager.)", "Whatever happens in the arena of fake news, the same techniques are sure to revolutionise fiction of a different kind, in the form of film and television. In future, actors need not be creatures of flesh and blood, but could, like so many other things in an increasingly digitised world, exist as nothing more than long strings of 1s and 0s. Such digital actors would sit quietly in digital storage systems until their services were needed\u2014there would be no need for luxury trailers, chefs and make-up people.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Actors would be able to star in 100 different films in the same year, and carry on full and productive careers decades after their deaths. They would never age, and versions of them at different ages could appear in different films. (In the month of her death in 2016, a digitally rejuvenated Carrie Fisher appeared at the end of \u201cRogue One\u201d, reprising the role of Princess Leia from the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d in 1977.) Directors would also be able to tweak the casts of their films to match the tastes of their audiences, suggests Darren Hendler at Digital Domain, a visual-effects company. Donnie Yen might play the leading role in the Chinese release of an action film, say, while Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson stars in a version for the American market. Actors need not even be based on real humans at all, but could be focus-group-approved composites, or designed by committee.", "My fair CGI lady", "Hepburn was resurrected thanks to the efforts of Framestore, a special-effects company based in London. She was not the first actor to be brought back in this way. In 1993, for instance, Brandon Lee\u2014son of Bruce\u2014died during the filming of \u201cThe Crow\u201d. The film was eventually completed with a mix of script rewrites, body doubles, existing footage of Lee and an early form of the digital trickery used by Framestore on Hepburn. Over the years a trickle of other stars, from Oliver Reed in \u201cGladiator\u201d to Marlon Brando in \u201cSuperman Returns\u201d, have returned to the screen thanks to the power of special effects based on computer-generated imagery (CGI).", "But doing that well is hard work, says Tim Webber, Framestore\u2019s head of visual effects. For the Hepburn ad, Framestore employed two actors to work as doubles, one whose body looked like Hepburn\u2019s, and one whose face bore a general resemblance. Teams of digital artists then used historical footage of Hepburn and painstakingly replaced the real actor\u2019s head with a computer-generated replacement. Close-ups are especially tough, says Mr Webber, because humans are hyper-sensitive to even small imperfections in how computer-generated faces look.", "All this is hugely labour-intensive. But this year\u2019s fake videos of Mr Obama and Mr Trump were made in a different way that is much cheaper and faster. They are so-called \u201cdeepfakes\u201d, created using a technique that, as the name suggests, uses a form of AI called deep learning to create fake videos. Essentially, a multi-layered (ie, \u201cdeep\u201d) neural network is shown images of a particular face, taken from different angles and with different expressions. Given enough such examples (ideally, hundreds or thousands) the network learns what the face looks like, and how to redraw it from any angle and with any expression. It is then just a matter of picking a video to edit, and instructing the network to replace a face in the video with the one it has been studying.", "This technique first came to prominence in 2017, when an anonymous user uploaded a pornographic video to the internet in which the original actor\u2019s face had been replaced (without permission from anyone involved) with that of Gal Gadot, an actor best known for portraying Wonder Woman in a series of superhero films. This led to the creation of an entire sub-genre of porn videos, as well as a cavalcade of comic face-swapped clips, as people downloaded the necessary software, which is available free online. The quality of this amateur face-swapping varies enormously; getting good results takes some fiddling, a powerful PC and a large selection of images of the face being superimposed. But none of those would be a problem for a Hollywood studio. As deepfake technology is incorporated into professional video-editing tools, face-swapping will surely become much faster, cheaper and more convincing than it is today.", "Looks aren\u2019t everything, however. So deep learning is also being applied to copying voices, not just faces. In this case, a neural network is trained using recordings and transcripts of someone speaking, so that it learns how they map words onto sounds. Given new text, the network can then generate convincing audio. Earlier this year CereProc, a Scottish company, used this technique to synthesise the voice of John F. Kennedy making the speech he was due to give on the day of his assassination in 1963. Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, an image-manipulation tool, has developed a program called VoCo, which has been called \u201cPhotoshop for voice\u201d. It can simulate someone\u2019s voice saying almost anything, given 20 minutes of their speech to analyse. In 2017 Baidu, a Chinese technology firm, published details of a similar voice-cloning system called Deep Voice, which works with as little as three seconds\u2019 worth of training data. Other technology firms, including Google DeepMind, are doing similar work.", "Digital rights and wrongs", "What happens when faces and voices can be manipulated as easily as text, images and video? Low-paid actors who roughly match the proportions and appearance of big stars might work as human puppets, their features and voices digitally replaced after filming. Hollywood itself has speculated on where the trend might end up. In \u201cThe Congress,\u201d a film released in 2014, Robin Wright plays a washed-up actor (also called Robin Wright), who allows herself to be digitised, signing over the rights to her likeness to MiraMount, a fictional film studio.", "One advantage is clear from the film: Ms Wright\u2019s character is notorious for being demanding and fickle and generally hard to work with. Her digital doppelganger throws no tantrums and requires no pay; meanwhile, she gets a pile of cash and a quiet life. But the price is a loss of control over what her likeness does and how it\u2014and therefore she\u2014is perceived. In the film, the contract is a one-off sale, meaning all rights go to the studio forever. Ms Wright specifies that her likeness will not appear in porn films, nor any movies to do with the Nazis. But it ends up starring in a schlocky but wildly popular science-fiction series that she would never have agreed to herself.", "The question of who owns the rights to an actor\u2019s digital likeness has already arisen in reality. Framestore had to negotiate with Hepburn\u2019s family in order to make its advert. But a star\u2019s fans often feel a sense of ownership, too. In 2013 a computer-generated version of Bruce Lee was used in an advert in China for Johnnie Walker, a brand of whisky. Johnnie Walker says it consulted with Shannon Lee, Bruce\u2019s daughter, who approved the idea. But many fans were cross, pointing out that Lee had been teetotal for much of his adult life, and asserting that, had he still been alive, he would never have appeared in such an advertisement.", "The advent of deepfakes has heightened legal concerns. SAG-AFTRA, an American actors\u2019 union, says it is taking steps to protect its members from unauthorised use of their digital likenesses, whether in advertisements, marketing, \u201cfake news\u201d propaganda, movies, video games or pornography. Meanwhile, a bill being considered by the New York state assembly, which would restrict the creation of \u201cdigital replicas\u201d of individuals without their permission, came under fire in June 2018 from both Disney, the studio behind \u201cStar Wars\u201d, Marvel and other franchises, and the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents entertainment companies. Disney said that while the bill was \u201cpresumably well-intended\u201d because it could prevent the use of celebrity images in unauthorised pornography, it would make it difficult for \u201ccompanies like ours to tell stories about real people and events\u201d, for example in biopics. The MPAA said that although \u201cthe emerging \u2018deepfake\u2019 problem deserves attention\u201d, the bill\u2019s vague wording would result in \u201cunintended, harmful consequences and is likely unconstitutional\u201d. Hollywood, it seems, is opposed to today\u2019s unauthorised face-swapping, but wants to ensure it has a free hand to use such technology itself in the future.", "It is easy to see why actors\u2019 unions might be worried about digital actors, and why studios might wish to protect their ability to create and use them. Digital actors could make life much easier for movie studios, while making things much harder for actors\u2014or at least, the majority of them. Acting is already a winner-takes-all game, in which a small number of participants take the lion\u2019s share of the rewards. Being able to clone themselves, in effect, might allow big stars to take an even bigger share of the pie. Meanwhile, up-and-coming actors will find it much harder to catch a director\u2019s eye while working as an extra. \u201cBen Hur\u201d famously had a cast of thousands. But these days, the swarming crowds and clashing armies seen in blockbuster films consist of computer-generated characters instead.", "I\u2019ll be back, and back, and back", "The rise of digital actors could also entrench the film industry\u2019s existing conservatism. Movies, especially blockbusters, are expensive to make, which is why studios are so keen on sequels and remakes: the low-risk strategy is simply to give viewers more of what they already know they like. There have been five \u201cTerminator\u201d films since the first one was released in 1984, and Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2014or his computer-generated likeness\u2014has been in every one. There is no reason he could not appear in five more over the next 34 years. Similarly, there have so far been 20 films set in Marvel\u2019s Cinematic Universe, which is based on that firm\u2019s comics. Comic-book characters are infamous for never ageing, never staying dead and being available for endless reboots or side-stories. Virtual actors offer all the same benefits.", "Those fed up with watching their hundredth Hugh Grant romantic comedy might have other options, however, if face-swapping technology can be made to work on the fly. Why not let viewers pick the actors they would like to see swapped into particular roles\u2014or even let viewers splice themselves and their friends into their favourite films? Not everybody watches films for the acting; sometimes the communal act of viewing is just as important, and could be extended onto the screen.", "This may all be decades away, and it may never happen. Auteurs will no doubt refuse to use digital actors in their films on principle (though some might prefer them, since they will uncomplainingly follow even the most tyrannical director\u2019s every command). But the rise of immortal digital actors is the logical outcome as today\u2019s effects-heavy film-making techniques embrace the versatility of artificial intelligence. A trick that is currently resorted to only rarely could easily become a standard cinematic tool, like matte shots, green screens and CGI before it. Digital actors open up new possibilities in storytelling. But they also raise many new questions\u2014and they will be able to answer them using any face, or voice, you like."], "pubDate": null}
