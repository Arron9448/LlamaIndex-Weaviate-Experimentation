To enjoy the simpler things in life (i.e. a blank page to fill), start by grabbing one of the best planners for 2021. Having a place to jot down your notes and ideas will not only give you a much-needed break from all of your devices, but it\u2019ll also make you feel a bit more organized, whether you\u2019re recording home improvement plans, fitness goals, important dates, or motivational quotes.", "Vogue\u2019s fashion news editor Sarah Spellings relies on the dotted version of Leuchtturm planner, which will help anyone stay on top of the nitty-gritty details of each month, week, and day. \u201cI use the medium-sized Leuchtturm notebook (the best part is selecting a color),\u201d says Spellings. \u201cThe pages are great quality, and pre-numbered.

It comes with a coordinated gold-trimmed pencil that\u2019ll make you feel luxuriously studious while you\u2019re taking notes. You could also grab a reusable agenda cover by your favorite fashion designer.
