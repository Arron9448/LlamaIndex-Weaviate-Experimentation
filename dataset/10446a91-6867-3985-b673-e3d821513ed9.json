Ultimate, series creator Masahiro Sakurai released a special Smash Bros. Direct this week.", "Sakurai began the stream by stating the fans' complaints had \u201cdeeply affected\u201d him on an emotional level, and he solemnly swore to never add another sword user.", "\"You all have been politely screaming at me for a while to stop adding sword characters to Smash,\" Sakurai explained, his eye twitching. \u201cI realize actions speak louder than words, so I figured it\u2019s best to show you how committed I am to pleasing the lot of you.\u201d", "He pulled out a photo of Crono, the hero of Chrono Trigger and a long-requested Smash Bros. fighter. \u201cAh yes, Crono. I had big plans for this one but I realize he is both a sword wielder and an anime man. All of you have made it abundantly clear that you want no part of him in Smash for this reason, so consider your wish granted.\u201d Sakurai then held the photo up to the camera and slowly tore it down the middle.", "Sakurai didn\u2019t stop there. He then opened a small safe containing a rough sketch of Halo\u2019s Master Chief battling Mario, remarking, \u201cIt took years to pull this one off. Oh wait, doesn\u2019t he use a laser sword?\u201d He then crumpled the drawing and tossed it out the window of his corner office.", "This went on for a surprising 57 minutes. At one point, Sakurai ordered his secretary to feed a sheet of move-lists for Ninja Gaiden\u2019s Ryu Hayabusa into a nearby shredder. Around the 32-minute mark, he brandished a real-life sword and sliced a big \u201cX\u201d into Zagreus from Hades. \u201cIt\u2019s uncanny how some of the coolest characters use sword weapons. Oh well!\u201d laughed Sakurai as he grinded his heel into a photo of Kingdom Hearts\u2019 Sora while \u201cSimple And Clean\u201d played in the background.", "Sakurai ended the video in dramatic fashion: by setting fire to a photo of Waluigi holding what appeared to be a crudely Photoshopped picture of Excalibur."], "authors": ["Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Darth Clark Is The Totally Real Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Which Appears Annually In Game Informer", "Usually Around April Fool S Day .
