The AS2 is a sleek business jet which will cruise at Mach 1.4, or 1,000mph, and bring routes like London to New York, Dubai or Beijing closer by hours.", "Ambitiously, it's being designed to run completely on biofuels. Boeing's provision of engineering, manufacturing and flight test resources should see it fly in 2023.", "The AS2 is aimed at business travelers, with a 12-passenger capacity suited to capturing the biz jet market.", "Likewise, Boston-based Spike Aerospace is developing the Spike S-512 supersonic business jet, which could hold up to 18 passengers.", "Meanwhile, another aircraft in development is planning to bring back commercial travel by supersonic airliner.", "The Boom Supersonic is a sleek 55-seat jet with delta wings reminiscent of early Concorde designs.
