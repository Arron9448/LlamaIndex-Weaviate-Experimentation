How would the way fashion is made, and the way that we all interact with it, change in the face of urgent calls for racial equity, an ongoing climate crisis, and the devastating effects of a global pandemic? We divided the answers into five chapters, which we have titled Creating Fashion, Sustainable Fashion, Buying Fashion, Responsible Fashion, and Viewing Fashion. Taken together, they reveal a wide-ranging portrait of our time while also pointing the way forward\u2014to a different fashion calendar, a different protocol for production, and an altogether different relationship with clothes. Here, 12 celebrities, photographers, and leaders from tech weigh in on the future of Viewing Fashion.", "Big Freedia, Musician", "I want fashion that\u2019s colorful, joyful, and risky\u2014from head to toe, from the hair to the makeup to the jewelry. It plays a big part in my everyday life\u2014I\u2019m always trying to push the boundaries in every direction. Especially now, I\u2019m looking forward to supporting more Black-owned businesses and Black designers. Charles Sterling is one\u2014he\u2019s from New Orleans, a young guy, really talented\u2014and I love Pink Lucy\u2019s work. But I also just ran into a girl at the gas station who was a designer; she was like, \u201cOh my God, I would love to make you some jeans.\u201d I love creating opportunities for other people to get their name and their work out there. I just want to see more Black faces everywhere.", "Derek Blasberg, Head of Fashion and Beauty Partnerships, YouTube", "The past nine months, though, have forced the whole industry to rethink absolutely everything: At the outset of COVID-19, YouTube helped our partners create content that encouraged their community to #stayhome to save lives. When the disparity in social justice emerged, we created a fund dedicated to amplifying Black creators and artists. Later, when it was time to think about Fashion Week, we worked closely with brands to evolve their runway struts into digital footprints. Going digital allows designers to share stories, elevate designs, and entice their audiences. Yves Saint Laurent once said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful about my art is that dream and reality become one.\u201d Lately, this industry is forcing itself to confront a tough reality of its own. But it\u2019s important we let it dream too.", "Bibi Borthwick, Photographer", "I\u2019m 29 years old, and this is the first time in the life of my generation that we\u2019ve had the space and the time to go inward to look at ourselves and try to figure out why we\u2019re even in the fashion industry. Now, more than ever, I want it to slow down. I love so many things about this industry, but there are also things I don\u2019t relate to and don\u2019t necessarily agree with. Fashion has become so competitive because of how saturated it is, and sometimes that brings out the worst in people. They\u2019re not necessarily saying something that is representative of who they really are inside\u2014but maybe they\u2019ve never had the chance to figure out who they are inside.", "I remember my father [photographer Mark Borthwick] telling me stories about he and his friends just sitting at home, and someone would come up with an idea for styling, someone would do the makeup, and then their friend would be the model. That sense of collaboration and unity\u2014that needs to come back."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "As Told To", "Jason Duzansk", "Rinaldi Parunga"], "keywords": ["things", "black", "different", "viewing", "ghesqui\u00e8re", "future", "really", "industry", "stallion", "love", "work", "nicolas", "thee", "way", "megan", "fashion"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
