White explains: \u201cIt is easy to look at the scale of the challenge we face and think that it is insurmountable. We want to challenge that.\u201d He cites its annual Love Food Give Food campaign, in which restaurants across the UK add an optional \u00a31 donation to your bill during autumn. Although that\u2019s a small amount for most of us, this sum can provide a malnourished child with a day\u2019s worth of life-saving food. \u201cA pound isn\u2019t a massive amount of money, but they quickly add up,\u201d he says.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Action Against Hunger\u2019s Love Food Give Food campaign sees restaurants add an optional \u00a31 to bills: \u2018A pound isn\u2019t a massive amount of money, but they quickly add up.\u2019", "Based in London, with a second site recently opened in Birmingham, the Bike Project also transforms lives through a seemingly small change: the chance to own a bike. The charity takes abandoned or donated bicycles, reconditions them and gives them to refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. \u201cWe believe no-one seeking asylum in the UK should be forced to choose between taking the bus and their next hot meal,\u201d says national operations manager Nicola Hill.", "Currently, most asylum seekers receive just \u00a337.75 to live on each week. \u201cWhen a weekly bus pass can cost \u00a321, this leaves many people destitute and socially isolated, unable to access vital services or the many opportunities that the UK has to offer in order to start rebuilding their lives,\u201d says Hill. That\u2019s where the bikes come in. \u201cWe take an unwanted item, in the form of a bike, and use it to achieve social change. Over the past six years we\u2019ve been pioneering in what we do, striving to deepen our impact with the refugees we support.\u201d As well as giving recipients the confidence and skills they need to start cycling, the charity also sells good-as-new bikes to support its work.", "Whether these organisations are donating their 5,000th bike or persuading more than 500,000 diners to part with that all-important pound, both are milestone-driven \u2013 and success wouldn\u2019t be possible without their teams. So, how does everybody stay on track? \u201cWe have a clear purpose and strong brand values which all our staff rally behind,\u201d says White at Action Against Hunger, while Hill says: \u201cOur mission is very clear \u2013 there\u2019s no ambiguity about what we\u2019re all striving to achieve on a daily basis.\u201d", "A solid core means their influence can radiate out and inspire new changemakers, from Action Against Hunger\u2019s Michelin-starred chefs to the Bike Project\u2019s cyclists and upcyclers. \u201cWe harness support from the cycling community, people who want to show solidarity with refugees and those who don\u2019t want to see a perfectly good item (in this case, a bike) go to waste,\u201d says Hill. \u201cWe never stop learning and are conscious that we\u2019re only just scratching the surface of what we and our supporters can collectively achieve.\u201d Both charities nurture collaboration internally and externally, keeping ideas fresh and horizons broad.", "The blogger championing refugees: 'We all have a story that deserves to be heard\u2019 Read more", "\u201cThere are an estimated 160,000 refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, and so we are acutely aware that there is so much more to be done,\u201d says Hill, whose sights are set on expansion across the UK. They\u2019ve already upscaled considerably, which can cause practical problems for some charities, but the Bike Project benefits from provable results and a source of revenue from bike sales. To support their growth they also use Salesforce.org\u2019s customer relationship management (CRM) system for non-profit organisations. It\u2019s helpful for \u201ckind of everything\u201d, says Hill, from tracking the lifecycle of a bike as it passes through the mechanics, to automated SMS appointments when it\u2019s ready to be given away.", "The real driver of big change, however, is big passion. \u201cWhatever our job title, we are all involved directly in our core work of bike donations,\u201d says Hill, whose charity accepts unwanted bikes at 25 locations across London, Oxford and the west Midlands. \u201cThis means everyone has first-hand experience of how what we do has an impact on the lives of refugees,\u201d she continues.", "\u201cWe try to find and attract the people who want to make a difference,\u201d says White of Action Against Hunger. \u201cOnce you show someone who wants to make a difference the impact we can have together, change is inevitable.\u201d", "To learn more about Salesforce.org \u2018Changemaker Correspondents\u2019, visit Salesforce.org/changemaker"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["food", "change", "uk", "organisations", "support", "inspiring", "cyclists", "white", "chefs", "refugees", "charities", "hill", "bike", "action"], "id": "3ea3f69c-6c80-3cc6-9fa9-479966bccd0a", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Abi Smith"], "title": "From chefs to cyclists: how inspiring charities make a change"}
