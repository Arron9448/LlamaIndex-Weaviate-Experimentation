It appeared on November 30th on a post published by the States Times Review, a blog which delights in hectoring the Singaporean authorities. The post alleged that the country\u2019s elections are rigged and that the next one could \u201cpossibly turn Singapore into a Christian state\u201d.", "The idea that the ruling People\u2019s Action Party is trying to turn Singapore into a theocracy is absurd\u2014even \u201cscurrilous\u201d, as the government put it. (The contention that it rigs elections is more defensible, although it does so not by stuffing ballot boxes, but by making life difficult for its critics and threatening adverse consequences for areas that vote for the opposition. It has won every general election in the past 60 years.)", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "The government, deeming the post false, asked its founder, who lives in Australia, to publish a correction notice under the Prevention from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act ( POFMA ), which came into effect in October. He refused, noting that the Australian authorities had not asked him to remove anything, but thanked the Singaporean government for boosting traffic to his site. Officials had more luck with Facebook, which made the notice visible to users in Singapore. States Times Review\u2019s website is blocked in Singapore, so Facebook is its chief means of reaching people there.", "The episode was not POFMA \u2019s only outing in recent weeks. The finance minister, Heng Swee Keat, who is widely expected to become the next prime minister, decided to invoke it against an obscure opposition politician, Brad Bowyer, who had questioned the independence and investment nous of Singapore\u2019s sovereign-wealth funds. Mr Bowyer\u2019s post had indeed contained errors, on which the authorities seized. But its main contention\u2014that the government\u2019s investments were not as well managed as they could be\u2014is clearly a subjective matter.", "The hubbub over the two orders relates more to the display of POFMA \u2019s powers than to the details of the posts themselves. The law aims \u201cto prevent the electronic communication in Singapore of false statements of fact\u201d and \u201cto suppress support for and counteract the effects of such communication\u201d, among other things. It allows any minister, upon declaring a particular statement to be false, to order its removal or correction. A special POFMA office advises ministers on how best to act. It also offers codes of practice to digital platforms.", "The accused can only seek recourse at the High Court after the minister in question has rejected an appeal (which costs about $150). The court can then rule on whether the original statement was indeed misleading. Individuals found guilty of ignoring correction orders or of deliberately spreading lies face criminal penalties, including prison terms of up to ten years, fines of S$100,000 ($73,000) or both. Social-media firms face fines of up to S$1m.", "Human rights groups, a UN Special Rapporteur and a cluster of tech firms have all opposed POFMA . Its vast scope\u2014from private group messages to online videos and beyond\u2014is a particular concern. And it joins a host of other legislation which already keeps critics in check. The country\u2019s constitution limits free speech with \u201csuch restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient\u201d. Contempt-of-court law has been used to target the odd journalist, cartoonist or blogger. Defamation cases trouble other outspoken figures.
