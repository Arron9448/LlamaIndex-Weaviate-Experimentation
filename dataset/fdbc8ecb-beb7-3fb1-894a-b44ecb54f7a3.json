It was so cute.\u201d", "She\u2019s in a cropped North Face puffer, stretch Zara jeans, and worn black riding boots, and looks like neither a harried mother of a 10-week-old nor a paparazzi-ducking supermodel. With her hair roped into a smooth bun, bare face, and tiny gold hoop earrings, she resembles mostly her teenage self, an equestrienne who show-jumped competitively while growing up in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California.", "\u201cWhat I really wanted from my experience was to feel like, Okay, this is a natural thing that women are meant to do.\u201d She\u2019d planned to deliver at a New York City hospital, but then the realities of COVID hit\u2014particularly sequestering here, 90 minutes from Manhattan, and the limits on numbers in the delivery room, which would have precluded Yolanda and Bella from being present. Then she and Malik watched the 2008 documentary The Business of Being Born, which is critical of medical interventions and depicts a successful home birth. \u201cWe both looked at each other and were like, I think that\u2019s the call,\u201d Gigi says.", "They placed a blow-up bath in their bedroom and sent their three cats and border collie away when the midwife expressed concern that the sphynx and Maine coon felines might puncture the tub with their claws. Malik asked Gigi what music she wanted to hear, and she surprised him by requesting the audio of a favorite children\u2019s novel, The Indian in the Cupboard. He downloaded the film because it was one of his favorites too, and they spent the early hours of labor watching it together. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019d never talked about but in that moment we discovered we both loved,\u201d Gigi says bashfully. She then tells me that Malik, the former One Direction star turned solo artist, who is famously press-shy (Gigi\u2019s publicist declined on his behalf to an interview), likened his own experience of her birth to a lion documentary he\u2019d seen in which a male lion paces nervously outside the cave while the lioness delivers her cubs. \u201cZ was like, \u2018That\u2019s how I felt! You feel so helpless to see the person you love in pain.\u2019\u201d", "Full Spectrum", "\u201cIn high school I used to Xerox Steven Meisel\u2019s pictures and color them in with pencil. When asked to do a cover story for Vogue\u2019s creativity issue, I thought back to that first creative output. It was a way to play with the idea of fantasy in fashion,\u201d says Ethan James Green of his inspiration for this digital cover.", "Gigi\u2019s Zoom doula, Malibu High classmate Carson Meyer, had prepared her for the moment where the mother feels she can\u2019t go any longer without drugs. \u201cI had to dig deep,\u201d Gigi says. \u201cI knew it was going to be the craziest pain in my life, but you have to surrender to it and be like, \u2018This is what it is.\u2019 I loved that.\u201d Yolanda and the midwife coached Gigi through the pain. \u201cThere definitely was a point where I was like, I wonder what it would be like with an epidural, how it would be different,\u201d Gigi says frankly. \u201cMy midwife looked at me and was like, \u2018You\u2019re doing it. No one can help you. You\u2019re past the point of the epidural anyway, so you\u2019d be pushing exactly the same way in a hospital bed.\u2019\u201d So she kept pushing."], "authors": ["Chloe Malle", "Chloe Mall", "Ethan James Gree", "Gabriella Karefa-Johnso"], "keywords": ["gigi", "looked", "malik", "hadid", "thats", "midwife", "wanted", "life", "modeling", "way", "yolanda", "motherhood", "pushing", "youre"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
