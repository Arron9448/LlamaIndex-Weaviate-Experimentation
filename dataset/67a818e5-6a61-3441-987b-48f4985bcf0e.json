The Federal Reserve\u2019s policies that have brought down mortgage interest rates have also pumped up home prices, making the purchase of houses less, not more, affordable.", "To be sure, that\u2019s not how most economists see things. Housing has been a plus for the economy along with overall consumer spending this year, which should extend into 2020.", "\u201cU.S. housing had a rough 2018 as the sector felt the lagged effect of four years of rate hikes and rising interest rates. That was reversed in 2019, and the lagged effects should last in 2020,\u201d write Don Rissmiller and Erica Halie Comp, economists at Strategas Research, in a research note.", "That\u2019s a good thing for the overall economy given that housing has been a key swing factor for the economy. Until the financial crisis, housing starts and U.S. gross domestic product growth have been tightly coupled, according to Julian Brigden, chief economist at Macro Intelligence 2 Partners. But housing has lagged behind during the long expansion after the bust that followed the previous boom.", "\u201cThe good news is that after a decade of crawling higher from the depths of the crisis, housing starts are again within spitting distance of GDP growth. The question is, where do we go from here?\u201d he writes in a client note.", "Housing will continue to be a plus for the economy in the new year. With 30-year fixed mortgage rates around 3.75%, they are up from their low of about 3.5% in early September, but well below the peak over 5% in 2018.", "There are a few problems beneath the surface, however, Brigden points out. Thanks to years of easy Fed policy, house prices have been driven to \u201cnose-bleedingly expensive levels,\u201d up by about a third from their cyclical lows, to $316,000 for new homes and $270,000 for existing homes. Higher housing prices means a bigger down payment since the days of zero-down mortgages are long gone. Between lower mortgage rates and higher prices, it\u2019s about a wash in terms of the monthly nut.", "For instance, on a $200,000 30-year fixed-rate loan at 5%, the monthly interest and principal payment would be $1,073.64. A $240,000 loan at 3.5% would cost $1,077.71 in monthly principal and interest. (That doesn\u2019t include the taxes most homeowners pay with their mortgage each month, however. Given the $10,000 limits on the federal deductibility of state and local taxes, plus the increased standard deduction of $24,000 for married couples, the after-tax cost for that mortgage payment is higher for many homeowners than before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.)", "The result, Brigden continues, is that even with the dip in mortgage rates, \u201chomes are so expensive that affordability remains a crucial issue.\u201d Looking at the big picture, mortgage applications remain in the broad range where they\u2019ve been for the past several years, even a blip up of 7% since the summer.", "That, in turn, will likely mean housing activity will plateau, at best. In which case, the current 30% rise in home sales from a low base could roll over, and eventually turn negative.", "That would spell bad news for home building stocks as they would face tough earnings comparisons. They\u2019ve been among the stock market\u2019s stars in this year\u2019s rally. Brigden points to the SPDR S&P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund (ticker: XHB), which he notes has outperformed the S&P 500 by about 20% year to date.", "After getting hit badly in the fourth quarter of last year, the home builders ETF rebounded spectacularly in 2019, gaining 50% and getting close to its January 2018 and 2006 pre-crisis highs. But that relative outperformance seems to have ended in late October, Brigden observes. After facing easy earnings comparisons from the depressed results of the fourth quarter of 2018, those comparisons get tougher next year.", "\u201cIndeed, given the risks that in the spring the [year-on-year] rate of change drops to zero, or even negative, we can\u2019t help but think about the performance of this index in 2018. Back then, after a euphoric peak in January, it went straight down for 11 months till Christmas. A fall of 35%, wiping out all its 2017 gains and more in the process,\u201d Brigden writes.", "\u201cThis brings us to the fundamental problem: the weakness of the Fed\u2019s policy, which boils down to merely pumping up asset prices. While it\u2019s theoretically possible to inflate financial assets like equities infinitely, for real-world assets, gravity applies in the form of affordability,\u201d he concludes.", "Higher stock prices make everybody richer, but more expensive housing is a two-sided coin. Higher house prices make owners richer but place formidable barriers to those seeking homes in high-cost areas. Just ask people in the San Francisco, New York, or Vancouver areas.", "The market will do its job to ration less affordable housing, with unavoidable social consequences. Home builder stocks are unlikely to be able to avoid the fallout, however. At the same time, one of the economy\u2019s props to growth may falter.", "Write to Randall W.
