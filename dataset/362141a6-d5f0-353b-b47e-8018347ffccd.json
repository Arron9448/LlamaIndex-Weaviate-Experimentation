Several federal trust funds, including those for Social Security and for the nation\u2019s highways, are expected to remain solvent for years longer than projected in September. Credit... Lucy Nicholson/Reuters The federal budget deficit is on course to reach $2.3 trillion for the 2021 fiscal year even if Congress does not pass another economic rescue bill, an amount slightly lower than the $3 trillion level it topped last year but still the second-highest deficit since World War II, the Congressional Budget Office said in new forecasts released Thursday. Yet the updated projections show an improving fiscal picture for the government than what the budget office forecast last fall. The budget office now sees the U.S. economy recovering faster than it previously expected, buoyed by stimulus and the ability of American businesses to adapt to the pandemic. The 2021 deficit projection has grown compared to the office\u2019s September forecasts, largely as a result of a $900 billion economic aid bill Congress passed in December. But projected deficits for the ensuing several years have shrunk by even more as a result of faster-than-expected economic growth, which is projected to increase tax and other federal revenue. Those projections are likely to fuel efforts by President Biden and congressional Democrats to speed passage of a $1.9 trillion aid package, which includes money to fight the coronavirus and help for struggling households and businesses. Republicans have objected to the size of the package, saying it is not necessary to spend that much at this point in the recovery and that it will further bloat the federal deficit. But Democrats, who are preparing to pass as much of the package as they can without Republican support, are likely to point to the C.B.O.\u2019s forecasts as justification for approving more aid. Still, the report highlights just how much money the United States is borrowing to finance all its spending. The budget office now expects the total amount of federal debt to reach 105 percent of the size of the nation\u2019s economy by 2030, down slightly from its September forecast of 109 percent. The total debt grew to larger than the size of the nation\u2019s economic output last year as a result of the pandemic recession and trillions of dollars in federal spending to combat it. Officials at the budget office said that another set of reports to released on Thursday afternoon would show that several federal trust funds, including those for Social Security and for the nation\u2019s highways, were now expected to remain solvent for years longer than the office projected in September. The report also now forecasts that the deficit will dip briefly below $1 trillion in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, before rising again in the second half of the decade. From 2021 through 2031, the deficit is forecast to average $1.2 trillion per year.", "Who\u2019s hiring? Job postings show demand in many fields despite the pandemic. A nurse updated patient information at a Santa Maria, Calif., hospital this week. The health care field is among those seeing an increase in hiring. Credit... Daniel Dreifuss for The New York Times Wanted: Health care workers, delivery drivers and technology professionals. Even as the job market struggles to find a footing, employers are putting out the welcome mat in certain fields, according to economists from two of the country\u2019s biggest online job sites, ZipRecruiter and Indeed. \u201cThere are clear differences between different industries,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. Besides the strength in industries that benefit from the stay-at-home trend, like warehousing and deliveries, hiring in tech and professional and business services has been showing signs of life recently. \u201cBusinesses are looking to the future and are somewhat optimistic,\u201d Ms. Pollak said. AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, added that demand for pharmacists is up 23 percent from a year ago while openings for drivers have jumped 18 percent. \u201cIt all ties directly back to the pandemic,\u201d Ms. Konkel said. Nevertheless, there have been important regional differences in hiring. In cities where many people are working remotely, like Washington, Seattle, Boston and San Francisco, there have been fewer postings in some fields than in places where more workers are back in the office. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t popping into their local coffee shop on their way to work or stopping into a store to pick something up when they work at home,\u201d Ms. Konkel said, and that affects hiring. Openings at restaurants are down from a year ago, she added, as are positions in arts and entertainment as well as hospitality and tourism. At ZipRecruiter, the energy industry has shown an increase in job postings after steep losses when the pandemic struck. Manufacturing, too, has recorded more openings lately. \u201cSome of the losers are finally coming backing a bit,\u201d Ms. Pollak said. \u201cBut so many industries can\u2019t possibly resume while the pandemic is going on.\u201d", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Unemployment claims remain high but decline as pandemic restrictions ease. A closed restaurant at Grand Central Market in Los Angeles. Workers in leisure and hospitality industries have been hit especially hard by job losses during the pandemic. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times Even as layoffs remain extraordinarily high by historical standards, unemployment claims have shown a recent decline as coronavirus cases and restrictions on activity recede. New claims for unemployment benefits declined last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, and were significantly below the level seen in most of December and early January. Last week brought 813,000 new claims for state benefits, compared with 850,000 the previous week. Adjusted for seasonal variations, last week\u2019s figure was 793,000, a decrease of 19,000. (Because of revisions to previous data, it was not the fourth straight weekly decline, as this briefing stated earlier.) There were 335,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federally funded program for part-time workers, the self-employed and others ordinarily ineligible for jobless benefits. That total, which was not seasonally adjusted, was down from 369,000 the week before. New coronavirus cases have fallen by a third from the level two weeks ago, prompting states like California and New York to relax restrictions on indoor dining and other activities. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck at this very high level of claims, but activity is picking up,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist with ZipRecruiter, an online employment marketplace. Indeed, job postings at ZipRecruiter stand at 11.3 million, close to the 11.4 million level before the pandemic hit. The improving pandemic situation has eased the strain on restaurants and bars, Ms. Pollak added. More generally, however, the leisure and hospitality industry is still under pressure. Plenty of other signs of weakness remain. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added just 49,000 jobs in January, underscoring the challenges for the nearly 10 million unemployed. President Biden cited the weak showing to press for approval of his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. It would send $1,400 to many Americans, provide aid to states and cities, and extend unemployment benefits that are due to expire for millions in mid-March. Ms. Pollak said postings by employers at ZipRecruiter in recent days offered hope. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen employers smash all of our expectations and show a great deal of exuberance,\u201d she said.", "Bloomberg News is laying off nearly 100 journalists as it restructures its newsroom.

The company will cut about 90 newsroom positions globally, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Most of those to lose their jobs will be editors, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information was not public. \u201cThis was not a step that we took lightly,\u201d Mr. Micklethwait wrote. \u201cBut we have always sought to make the newsroom better \u2014 to make us more nimble, to improve our content, and to help us \u2018chronicle capitalism\u2019 in an even more comprehensive way.\u201d He said that the new system would mean most editors would now report to managing editors, who would allocate them to individual stories, and would also get rid of \u201cunnecessary back-reading or re-editing.\u201d Mr. Micklethwait said that despite the layoffs, the company was looking to hire in priority areas like data journalism, and was aiming to end the year with as many journalists as it had before the pandemic. Bloomberg News has more than 3,100 editorial and research employees, making it one of the largest news organizations in the world. It has largely avoided the mass layoffs that have plagued the media industry in the past year. Bloomberg L.P., its parent company, has about 20,000 employees.

Microsoft\u2019s call for internet regulations is the latest example of fracturing within the tech industry as it comes under greater scrutiny. Credit... Carlo Allegri/Reuters", "", "Microsoft on Thursday called for the United States to adopt competition laws that would force tech platforms like Facebook and Google to share more revenue with news publishers, drawing a brighter line between itself and the tech giants who oppose the idea. Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said tech companies must do more to support independent journalism. He said some executives were motivated to speak out because of the misinformation that spread widely around the U.S. election and the decline of news organizations over the last two decades. As a guide to the kinds of laws the company had in mind, he pointed to Australia\u2019s proposed legislation for news publishers to negotiate jointly for higher fees from digital platforms. \u201cPublishers are left with nowhere else to go, so at the end of the day, they are forced to accept scraps on the table without any compensation for the fact that they produce a substantial portion of the meal on the other side of the table,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. Microsoft\u2019s call for internet regulations is the latest example of fracturing within the tech industry at a time when it is undergoing increased scrutiny. Google and Facebook have fiercely fought the Australian proposal and have threatened to abandon all or part of their services in the country should the news publishing law go into effect. Salesforce.com, Apple, and IBM have pushed for regulations over the business models of Facebook and Google that mine user data for advertising. Bills in the Senate and the House of Representatives have already been introduced to help news publishers jointly negotiate on fees for publishing their material on platforms like Google and Facebook. The coordination would most likely violate antitrust laws against collusion, but lawmakers have called for an exemption to address the emergency in local news, where 2,000 news organizations have shuttered since 2000. Mr. Smith said he and Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, recently called Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and praised the proposed competition legislation for internet platforms as a meaningful attempt to shore up journalism. They added that even if Google left the country, Microsoft would not.

Mr. Griffin\u2019s firm, Citadel, was a central player in the GameStop drama both because of its investments and the role of its sister company, Citadel Securities, as a market maker in stocks. It was asked to make an executive available for the Feb. 18 hearing scheduled by the House Financial Services Committee, this person said, but the company is still waiting to hear whether the committee will call Mr. Griffin or another executive. Steve Huffman, Reddit\u2019s chief executive said on Thursday that the social-media network also planned to participate.

A conceptual design of a new $20 note that was produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing depicting Harriet Tubman. The effort to make Harriet Tubman the face of the $20 note got a bipartisan push this week as two senators urged Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen to prioritize the planned redesign that stalled during the Trump administration. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, sent a letter to Ms. Yellen this week making the case that America\u2019s currency should reflect the diversity of the country. They lamented that the plan put in place by the Obama administration in 2016, to unveil a $20 note design in 2020 with Ms. Tubman\u2019s image on the front, was not carried out by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201cWe hope sincerely that is no longer the case, and encourage the prioritization of Ms. Tubman before working on other redesigns,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe stand ready to offer any support for your efforts to ensure this towering figure in our nation\u2019s history receives the recognition she has deserved for so long.\u201d The Biden administration said last month that Ms. Yellen would be studying ways to speed up the process of adding Harriet Tubman\u2019s portrait to the front of the $20 bill. \u201cIt\u2019s important that our money reflect the history and diversity of our country,\u201d Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said. A Treasury spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment about whether the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which the department oversees, had resumed the redesign featuring Ms. Tubman. Work on the redesign had started under the watch of former President Barack Obama\u2019s Treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, but Mr. Mnuchin said that enhancing the security features of the new notes took priority over changes to the imagery. Mr. Trump had previously expressed his disapproval of the idea of replacing President Andrew Jackson, a fellow populist, with Ms Tubman, a former slave and abolitionist. The Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence Steering Committee laid out plans in 2013 for the redesign of the $10 and $5 notes to occur before the $20. Ms. Shaheen and several House Democrats have been vocal supporters of the initiative to replace Mr. Jackson with Ms. Tubman as the face of the $20.

At Hormel, Planters will be added to a growing collection of food brands, including the peanut butter brand Skippy, which Hormel acquired in 2013, and Justin\u2019s nut butter, which it acquired in 2016. The pandemic has been a sales boon for Kraft Heinz, which had some of its factories working three shifts during periods in the past year to meet high demand for products like its Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. On Thursday, Kraft Heinz reported that net sales in the fourth quarter rose 6.2 percent to $6.9 billion. For the full year, Kraft Heinz said net sales rose 4.8 percent to $26.18 billion. The company said it expected to see flat-to-positive growth in net sales in 2021. Kraft Heinz, the result of a 2015 merger that created one of the largest food companies in the world, was struggling ahead of the pandemic. Its stock had slumped, underperforming other food companies, as sales and profits sank, in part because consumers had begun to favor less-processed, healthier foods in recent years. But during the pandemic, consumers, who were now cooking and consuming more meals at home, sought comfort foods and gravitated toward many old-school brands within Kraft Heinz and other food companies. Pepsico, a rival of Kraft Heinz, also reported a jump in fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. The snack giant\u2019s revenue rose 8.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, to $22.46 billion, powered by consumers munching on Cheetos and Doritos during the pandemic. For Kraft Heinz, the food boom has provided a good opportunity to shed businesses. Last September, it sold its natural cheese business to France\u2019s Groupe Lactalis for $3.2 billion. The nuts business, which contributed roughly $1.1 billion in net sales to Kraft Heinz for the past year, had been neglected inside the company and had lost market share to competitors, including private-label brands.

The jet was originally designed with a focus on performance by William Lear, an engineer. It entered service in 1963 and went on to play a key role in ushering in an era of luxury private flight. Mr. Sinatra reportedly bought his in 1965, using it for trips to and from Las Vegas and making it a symbol of ultimate luxury for the rich and powerful. More than 3,000 Learjets have been sold since its inception. But the jet has struggled in recent years because buyers of private jets considered it cramped and not as luxurious as other planes.
