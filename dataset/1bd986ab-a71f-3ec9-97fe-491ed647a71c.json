As children, we looked up to the flag and were proud of what it symbolized and what it stood for \u2013 freedom, opportunity and promise. Back then, we knew both parties \u2013 despite their political differences \u2013 shared the same values.", "Like so many other Nevadans, I registered with the Democratic Party because Democrats seemed to be the party of the working class. As a dishwasher who joined the Culinary Union, that\u2019s what was \u2013 and still is \u2013 important to me.", "But like President Ronald Reagan and President Donald Trump, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how the Democrat Party has changed \u2013 radically, and not for the better. They\u2019ve embraced a socialist, extremist agenda that is not the party of JFK, or of my parents. Their ideas hurt working-class families, restrict freedom and extinguish opportunity for millions of Americans \u2013 particularly working-class minorities who deserve the chance to give their families a better life.", "NIKKI HALEY: BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS \u2013 HERE ARE LESSONS HE CAN LEARN FROM TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION EXAMPLE", "As the Democratic mayor of North Las Vegas, I have the great privilege of leading our city, both in times of prosperity and through incredibly trying times, much like we\u2019ve seen this past year. We Nevadans, and we Americans, are resilient. We live in the greatest country in the world, made possible thanks to the values we hold dear. Today, these values are under attack.", "Here in Nevada, we\u2019ve seen the full takeover of the Democratic Party by admitted socialists. Their goal is clear \u2013 ending the America we know and love, and replacing it with a culture of socialist conformity that erases freedom, opportunity and liberty from the American canvas.", "I will not let the America I love be hijacked by an extremist left-wing mob that blacklists, bans, shouts down and cancels anyone who disagrees with them.", "That is why I am switching to register as a member of the Republican Party. Though I\u2019ve been a registered Democrat on paper, I made the switch in my heart a long time ago, because on some things, there\u2019s simply no compromise.", "That\u2019s why I voted for President Trump twice. That\u2019s why I had an A-plus rating from the NRA and their endorsement in my time in the state Senate. I refused to compromise my pro-life, pro-Second amendment values.", "There used to be a place in the Democratic Party for conservative voices like mine. Today, that\u2019s no longer the case.", "There used to be a place in the Democratic Party for conservative voices like mine. Today, that\u2019s no longer the case. Their party demands a senseless devotion to cancel culture, socialism and anti-American values I simply do not share.", "I\u2019m not the only former Democrat who feels abandoned by the modern Democrat Party. I know there are countless others who want to make the switch, because it means the difference between hope and despair for their children and grandchildren. And I want them to join me in making that switch.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER", "The Republican Party that has emerged from President Trump\u2019s leadership is a working-class party of opportunity, freedom and hope.
