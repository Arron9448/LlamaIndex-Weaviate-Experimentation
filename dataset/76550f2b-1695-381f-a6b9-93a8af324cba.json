So loved, in fact, that a few weeks later Mengniu Dairy, China\u2019s second-biggest producer of milk products, said it wanted to buy Bellamy\u2019s for A$1.5bn ($1bn). On December 5th its shareholders voted in favour of the deal.", "At first Bellamy\u2019s seemed to be milking it, not Mengniu. An Australian government committee that reviews foreign acquisitions set out conditions: Mengniu must keep headquarters and most of the board Australian, and pour A$12m into local factories. Mengniu offered a 59% premium on the firm\u2019s share price, which had shed three-fifths in the 18 months before the offer (it has rebounded a bit since). Mr Cohen blamed falling Chinese birth rates, a regulatory hold-up on imports and competition in China\u2019s thirsty infant-formula market.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Now Mengniu looks like the cat that got the cream. It wasted no time in making another bid on November 25th to buy Lion Dairy & Drinks, Australia\u2019s second-largest milk processor, for A$600m. The pair of acquisitions would hand it a rich vat of organic and premium brands that China\u2019s middle class covets, including Farmers Union yogurt and licences to the Yoplait franchise. Mengniu can tap high-quality Aussie milk. And it is one in the eye for Yili, its bigger cross-town dairy rival in Hohhot, the regional capital of Inner Mongolia.", "The two firms control about half of China\u2019s dairy market. If it wins Lion, Mengniu stands a chance at surpassing Yili by revenue next year, reckons Song Liang, an independent dairy analyst (both want to make sales of 100bn yuan, or $14bn). They are expanding in South-East Asia, where Bellamy\u2019s and Lion are already popular. Last year Yili acquired Thailand\u2019s biggest ice-cream maker. In August it bought Westland Milk Products, a New Zealand co-operative. It envisions \u201ca vast dairy bridge crossing the Pacific Ocean\u201d.", "In a decade Chinese milk production will meet only half of domestic demand, says Terrance Liu of CLSA , a broker, down from around 70% today. And, as Mengniu and its rival move overseas and upmarket, they need better ways to keep products chilled through production and transport, which rich-world firms can teach them. At home spending on formula per infant is rising thanks to declining rates of breast-feeding in many cities. A deadly tainted-milk scandal in 2008 has put shoppers off local products. CLSA estimates that four-fifths of Bellamy\u2019s products have ended up in China thanks to a flourishing informal trade by so-called daigou, who buy products overseas and resell them online."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "Mengniu Dairy gulps down two Australian milk producers", "pubDate": null, "summary": "So loved, in fact, that a few weeks later Mengniu Dairy, China\u2019s second-biggest producer of milk products, said it wanted to buy Bellamy\u2019s for A$1.5bn ($1bn).\nIt wasted no time in making another bid on November 25th to buy Lion Dairy & Drinks, Australia\u2019s second-largest milk processor, for A$600m.\nThe two firms control about half of China\u2019s dairy market.\nIn August it bought Westland Milk Products, a New Zealand co-operative.\nCLSA estimates that four-fifths of Bellamy\u2019s products have ended up in China thanks to a flourishing informal trade by so-called daigou, who buy products overseas and resell them online.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/12/05/mengniu-dairy-gulps-down-two-australian-milk-producers"}
