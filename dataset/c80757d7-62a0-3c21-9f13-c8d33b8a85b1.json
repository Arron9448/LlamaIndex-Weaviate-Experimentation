Workers often view AI as an enemy designed to destroy jobs and decimate livelihoods. By looking at AI as more of a partner, however, companies and their employees can actually create more value.", "Superteams: How to put AI in the group", "", "According to Erica Volini, Global Human Capital Leader at Deloitte, combining people and machines can create \u201csuperteams\u201d that work together to solve problems and gain insight. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting AI into the group and it\u2019s part of the evolving relationship between technology and people at work\u2014going from expanding the work potential of an individual\u2019s job to creating new approaches for those individuals to work together and create new possibilities,\u201d she explains.", "Through these superteams, companies can let humans focus on what they do best. So, instead of apprehensively focusing on how automation and AI technologies will change traditional business functions, adoption should be viewed in a different light. \u201cWhat has not been discussed as often is how these game-changing technologies will evolve the workers\u2019 mindset in evolving their skills to using technology as an augmented and collaborated strategy,\u201d says Nitin Rakesh, CEO at Mphasis.", "\u201cAs we stand on the threshold of preparing the 21st century workforce for a rapidly-changing enterprise, organisations are redesigning departments, adapting to this seismic shift, and preparing for an era of hyper-personalised needs and demands for customers.\u201d Rakesh says disruptive changes in AI are leading to changes in the workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s driving organisations to actively modernise jobs functions that create work environments where digital mindsets are embraced and upskilling becomes more habitual.\u201d", "Expanding the scope of AI", "", "But are organisations ready to fully embrace AI in this capacity? Deloitte\u2019s 2020 Human Capital Trends report found that only 12% of respondents said their organisations were primarily using AI to replace workers and 60% were using AI to assist workers.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re fully embracing AI\u2019s potential, however. \u201cThe way in which AI is being used to assist points to a bigger problem,\u201d Volini says. That\u2019s because over half of respondents said they were just using it to improve consistency and quality. To be clear, these are metrics that should always be improved upon.", "Volini explains that limiting AI to this narrow scope is problematic. \u201cIt minimizes the impact AI can have when it\u2019s part of the team,\u201d she says. \u201cOrganisations have to look at AI as a way to provide insights that can improve the way humans do their jobs\u2014that is how superteams will be formed and provide transformative value.\u201d", "Practical applications", "One example of AI\u2019s incredible potential can be found within healthcare. AI tools can accurately detect patient deterioration. \u201cThis allows health teams to be notified of clinical changes hours before a patient becomes critical,\u201d says Matt Johnson, CEO of EarlySense. \u201cBy identifying these risks early, health staff can take preventative action to mitigate the risk of an adverse event, such as code blue events that can result from cardiac or respiratory arrest, preventable ICU transfers ... and hospital readmissions.\u201d", "AI and machine learning are also being used to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) to help medical professionals identify and intervene when early detection and prevention measures could make a significant difference. \u201cBy leveraging existing, ordinary data with precision and speed, these organisations are able to prioritise patients that may show risk for conditions like lower GI and colorectal disorders, diabetes, lung cancer, flu and even COVID-19 complications,\u201d explains Dr. Jeremy Orr, CEO of Medial EarlySign. This can help to improve patient outcomes, but he says it can also alleviate the human and financial costs of disease.", "AI can be incorporated into other areas as well. \u201cUtilities companies are using AI, along with remote sensing and data analytics to manage infrastructure,\u201d Volini says. \u201cChatbots are being used in various industries not only to deliver rote responses, but in companies like HubSpot, they\u2019re also being used to qualify leads before connecting potential customers to a human salesperson.\u201d", "These are just some of the ways that AI can work with teams if companies are willing to view AI as a way to help humans do their jobs. \u201cOrganisations that build workforce security through reinvention will be those that are well-positioned to capitalise on AI\u2019s potential to drive enterprise value and create meaningful work,\u201d she concludes.", "Browse leadership courses for executives", "--", "Terri Williams is a freelance writer who covers leadership topics for The Economist Careers Network."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["ai", "winwin", "creates", "create", "human", "companies", "using", "organisations", "work", "potential", "collaborating", "used", "way"], "pubDate": "2021-02-26T11:40:08Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
