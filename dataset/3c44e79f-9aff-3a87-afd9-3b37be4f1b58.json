In the video, Schall doubles over with laughter as she recounts erstwhile aspirations like \u201ctravel more,\u201d \u201cbe more social,\u201d and \u201ccry less.\u201d", "The video caught fire for its relatability\u2014in a year when most of us are barely keeping it together, the idea of aspiring to any sort of self-improvement seems genuinely hilarious, if not utterly futile.

After nearly a year of attempting to work out without classes or gym onlookers to motivate me, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s best to start small. So rather than attempt a 90 minute at-home cardio kickboxing class (during which I will undoubtedly stop to look at my phone 12 times), I\u2019m committing to short, 10-ish minute classes from Ob\u00e9 Fitness. While the platform offers classes at every length and difficulty, I\u2019ve discovered I just don\u2019t have the attention span (or the stamina) for anything more than a bite sized yoga flow.

Unplug", "With nowhere to go and not much to do, I can\u2019t be the only one who\u2019s spent more time with my screens this year. I take a break from my laptop, only to check my phone. When I finally manage to sign off for the day, I inevitably start watching Netflix. The reflex to check my phone is so powerful, I need to physically remove it from my immediate surroundings to avoid mindless scrolling.

Mark the Passage of Time", "When someone asked me the date during a Zoom call last week, I was off by four days. Four days! Before the pandemic, I carried two calendars with me at all times: the Google calendar on my phone and a print planner that lived in my work bag. I\u2019d review both while drinking my coffee each morning, just to make sure I prepared for the day ahead. Now, I roll out of bed five, maybe ten minutes before my first virtual meeting, and I haven\u2019t touched my planner since March.

Learn Something New", "Many of us entered lockdown with ambitions of learning a new language, taking up needlepoint, or starting to paint. If you managed to do one of those things, I congratulate you! I, on the other hand, was disappointed to find that the adult coloring books I ordered were too challenging for me. When it comes to furthering my education, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to build on established interests.
