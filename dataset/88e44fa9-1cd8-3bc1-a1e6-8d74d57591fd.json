Despite the progress, they are still struggling to find enough people to staff their plants. The worker shortages are choking supply chains and delaying delivery of everything from car parts to candles just as demand is picking up.", "Among Covid-19\u2019s weird effects: Despite high unemployment levels, many employers are having trouble hiring enough workers. The unemployment rate held steady in December at 6.7%. Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits from state programs, a marker of layoffs, have also been steady at around 790,000. That\u2019s down sharply from a peak of nearly 7 million in March, but still around four times the pre-pandemic average.", "For manufacturers, staffing shortages have been caused by factors including a surge in new jobs tied to e-commerce\u2014many of which offer better pay than factory work\u2014and absences caused by Covid or family obligations such as child care.", "The worker crunch is creating shortages of some products and, in some cases, contributing to higher prices. That\u2019s because when items sell out faster than companies can make them, they don\u2019t need to use deals and discounts to stoke demand.", "Companies are taking extraordinary measures to keep their lines running. At a Wisconsin dairy plant, managers have been asking employees to cancel vacation and the company recently asked a maintenance worker to help make cheese. An Ohio auto-parts maker advertised jobs on city buses and is considering adding a graveyard shift for working parents. A generator maker is so backed up on orders due to absenteeism that it has raised starting pay 25%.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll do anything we can to get people in the door,\u201d said Scott Seaholm, president of Universal Metal Products Inc., which employs about 325 workers making clips and other metal parts at factories in Ohio and Texas. \u201cThat is what the game is right now.\u201d", "The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic has prompted a hiring push at warehouses and fulfillment centers that often compete with manufacturers for workers. Amazon.com Inc. said in September it would add 100,000 new employees with jobs paying at least $15 an hour. Another factor: Executives say rising absenteeism is largely due to a new surge in coronavirus infections and stricter protocols for workers who have had contact with an infected person.", "\u201cPeople feel like they aren\u2019t getting paid enough to put their life in danger,\u201d said Martez Williams, a former contract worker at Procter & Gamble Co.

The 36-year-old now has a contract job at a plastics factory. It pays less than the $16.25 he was making at P&G, but the plant feels safer, he said, because he doesn\u2019t work in such close proximity with others and fewer of his new coworkers appear to skip temperature checks.", "A P&G spokeswoman said the company has seen no evidence of community spread at its plants. \u201cHowever, as we\u2019ve all learned this year, ultimately it\u2019s up to each of us to follow the guidance put forth by scientists and medical professionals,\u201d she said.

(In November, its measure of production-worker absenteeism was 2.3%, falling in line with the overall industry for the first time since February.) A year ago, production-worker absenteeism was 1.8%, compared with 1.9% for the overall job market.", "The unemployment rate would be even higher if more people were looking for work. But the labor-force participation rate\u2014the proportion of working-age Americans with a job or actively looking for one\u2014is at low levels not seen since the late 1970s, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The U.S. labor force lost roughly 3.8 million workers since February as fewer people are working or looking for a job and the pandemic has pushed many baby boomers out of the workforce.

That is still about double the rate before the pandemic. Besides those who test positive for the coronavirus, employees who come in contact with infected people are told to call off work and quarantine.", "The manpower shortages are disrupting operations when the company can least afford it. Orders for generators are 2 \u00bd times as high as a year ago, according to Generac Chief Executive Aaron Jagdfeld, because homebound workers want to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a hurricane in every state,\u201d Mr. Jagdfeld said of demand.", "Meanwhile, Generac is facing a shortage of parts from suppliers without enough labor and materials or efficient transportation.

Its Whitewater, Wis., plant operates with as many as 14 different shifts to accommodate employees who can\u2019t work standard times. To attract students from the University of Wisconsin campus in Whitewater, Generac is offering three, 12-hour shifts over weekends.

With restaurants and schools closed, orders for milk have declined. That has left companies like Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery to boost production of cheese, which can be stored longer.", "The co-op has been hiring more workers as jobs are left vacant by sick or quarantining staff on packaging lines and in warehouses, said CEO Paul Bauer. But some positions require months of training.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t like I can pull someone off the street to make cheese,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ramifications of all of this are just so taxing.\u201d", "In December, roughly 20% of Mr. Bauer\u2019s workforce was absent on any given day at the main plant. To keep up with orders, and a surge in milk deliveries from the co-op\u2019s 300 farmers, Mr. Bauer has shut whey-packing lines to staff cheese-production lines, and asked employees to cancel vacations or work double shifts. One-fourth of Mr. Bauer\u2019s plant managers were recently out at the same time.", "\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with more milk and less-skilled people than ever before,\u201d Mr. Bauer said. He recently tapped a maintenance employee with cheese-making experience to work a shift making cheese.", "Car-parts breakdown", "Auto sales roared back far more quickly than analysts anticipated following assembly-plant and dealership shutdowns in the spring. That has forced the industry into overdrive to meet pent-up demand.", "While big car makers like General Motors Co. have faced worker absences, they say they have been able to lean on larger, more flexible workforces, recruit temporary workers and offer relatively high wages. The companies supplying the industry\u2019s parts, which had difficulties finding workers before the pandemic hit this spring, are struggling to keep up.", "New orders for autos and parts over the past few months exceed those booked in the months leading up to the pandemic, government data show. But staffing levels for auto-parts suppliers have yet to recover to similar levels. At roughly 563,000, the number of nonsupervisory workers on supplier payrolls in November was about 25,000 less than in the first quarter, according to data from the BLS.", "Gary Grigowski, co-owner of Team 1 Plastics Inc. in Albion, Mich., which supplies plastic switches and filters, said persistently high unemployment hasn\u2019t translated into a bigger worker pool.

When those weren\u2019t enough, they tapped the salaried workforce. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Well, whatever they are working on now isn\u2019t as important as making the product,\u2019\u201d Ms. McCarthy said.", "CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "Pandemic-related shutdowns in the early spring halted candle production when Newell would have been building inventory for the holidays. When the facilities reopened in May, the company\u2019s contract workforce had largely fanned out to other companies that hadn\u2019t closed, and there were few applicants for new jobs. Executives say they believe potential new hires stayed away due to a combination of since-ended unemployment benefits and health concerns.", "Filling jobs is easier now, but rising coronavirus cases mean more employees are missing work. Absenteeism is two to three times higher than normal levels as workers stay home either because they are infected, have potential Covid symptoms, or because they have come in contact with an infected person, said Daily Gist, vice president of R&D for the company.", "\u201cA lot of us haven\u2019t slept, thinking, \u2018How do we get people out here?\u2019\u201d Ms. Gist said, standing in front of the sprawling Whately factory as masked workers filed past her into a lobby that smelled like salted caramel.", "The company requires employees who have been exposed to the virus to stay home until they can be tested, even if they have no symptoms. Workers must stand 6 feet apart, get their temperature checked and wear a mask inside.

Workers don\u2019t receive additional pay and must fit the factory work around their regular jobs. Shifts are generally four hours.", "Ms. McCarthy, the Newell fragrance president, has worked several Yankee factory and warehouse shifts. She said the work can be repetitive, physically taxing and fast-paced.
