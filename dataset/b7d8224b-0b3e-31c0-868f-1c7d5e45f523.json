The law is part of a pattern of persecution of Muslims carried out by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, who seek to transform India from an avowedly secular, pluralistic country into a Hindu one. This past August, Modi revoked the autonomy of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, Kashmir, and flooded it with troops, in an ongoing siege. In Assam, another state with a large Muslim population, the government implemented the National Register of Citizens, which forced people to prove or lose their citizenship status. Immigrants whose citizenship was stripped by the state are already being sent to detention camps; last month, the government declared that the citizenship registry would soon cover the entire country. The cumulative effect of these moves has been to throw India\u2019s democratic character and future into a precarious state not seen since the mid-nineteen-seventies, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency and imprisoned her political opponents.", "In response to the Citizenship Amendment Act, demonstrations have broken out across India. Many of them have been met with violence from authorities; several protesters have been killed. To help understand the legislation and the widespread backlash against it, I spoke by phone with Niraja Gopal Jayal, a professor at the Center for the Study of Law and Governance at Jawaharlal Nehru University and the author of several books on Indian democracy, including \u201cCitizenship and Its Discontents.\u201d During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed India\u2019s uneven history of religious tolerance, how Modi was able to exploit religious chauvinism, and the greatest challenges facing those who care about the future of liberalism in the country.", "Is India facing the most dire threat to its democracy in its seventy-two years of existence?", "I am not sure I would say it\u2019s the biggest threat to India\u2019s democracy. I think it\u2019s the biggest threat to India\u2019s self-definition as a nation\u2014the definition that India adopted at independence, which was informed by the values of the movement for freedom from British rule and embodied in the Indian constitution. I think that vision of India, as a secular, inclusive, plural, multicultural democracy, is certainly under threat more than at any previous time.", "What specifically is worrying to you about this citizenship legislation? And what might be coming next?", "It introduces, for the first time, a religious criterion as a test for citizenship. Obviously, someone who supports it could argue that it only applies to people who are refugees or illegal migrants\u2014it doesn\u2019t apply to existing Indian citizens. That argument has indeed been made, but I think that it is a threat to the idea of Indian citizenship per se. It is, in some senses, a body blow to the constitutional ideal of equality of citizenship regardless of caste, creed, gender, language, and so on. Ours is a secular constitution, and the worry is that the introduction of the religious criterion will yield, effectively, a hierarchy of citizens, a kind of two-tiered, graded citizenship.", "The even bigger worry is the introduction of religion as a criterion of citizenship in India, because then you open up the floodgates. Like you said, what\u2019s next? If this gets validated in the courts, the next step is that there will be a national register of Indian citizens, for which the law has existed for several years now. That will be activated, and the promise has been made that it will be completed by 2024, which is the next general election. If the Citizenship Amendment Act, which was just passed the other day, is actually enabling some religious groups to become naturalized citizens, leaving out only one major religious group\u2014that is, Muslims\u2014what the National Register of Citizens would do would be to essentially disenfranchise people, including existing Muslim citizens, but Hindus as well who cannot establish, as per the list of documents that may be required, that they are, in fact, Indian citizens.", "In a country like ours, there are very large numbers of poor people who are not lettered, who are undocumented. As has happened in Assam already, you will have large numbers of people, Hindus, Muslims, and others, who are nationals, whose ancestors have lived in this land forever, but who would not have the documents to prove it. You could actually, at the same time, have immigrants who have come in and acquired documents, because that\u2019s the first thing they need to do. You could have non-nationals who have documents and get citizenship, and you could have nationals who are undocumented and are stripped of citizenship. The worry is that the burden of this would fall largely on poor people, and on poor Muslims, because the others could get regularized under the Citizenship Amendment Act. That, in fact, is the sequence of this thing.", "What you\u2019re arguing is that we will see what\u2019s happening in Assam start to happen on a nationwide level.", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct. That\u2019s the plan that\u2019s been announced, partly also to correct what happened in Assam. It turned out very differently than had been anticipated. 1.9 million people were excluded finally in the last round, and a very large proportion of that 1.9 million actually turned out to be Hindus rather than Muslims. Even those people who have championed the National Register for Citizens in Assam, in a sense, were disappointed and surprised by the outcome. Assam is going to go through this whole exercise yet again when the all-India register takes place.", "Some of the people defending the government will say, \u201cLook, in Assam, it wasn\u2019t just to go after Muslims. There were Hindus who were on the list, too. This is about illegal immigration. It\u2019s not about creating a Hindu state or anything like that.\u201d How do you respond to that?", "The people who are saying that would have to acknowledge that not all illegal migrants are being treated equally. There is only one group of illegal migrants, the Muslims, who are to be excluded from the language of this amendment. Everybody else is being given fast-track citizenship.", "The National Register actually starts with the assumption that all of us, 1.3 billion of us, have to prove that we are citizens. The onus of proving that you\u2019re a citizen lies upon you, and the assumption is that, until proven, you are not a citizen, basically. People of my generation didn\u2019t have birth certificates back in the day. I don\u2019t have a birth certificate. They are a fairly recent invention, and not everyone even today has a birth certificate, unless you\u2019re born in a good hospital in a city. If you\u2019re born in a village, often people are still born at home. Lots of people don\u2019t have the kind of documentation that is needed.", "All those who are not Muslims but who are illegal immigrants get regularized and covered by the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be left, then? The residue is going to be Muslims, right? Once you have sifted and sorted citizens in this rather malevolent way, the Citizenship Act will cover all illegal migrants except Muslims. The two things go together. What will be left will be simply Muslim immigrants and not others, because others will then have got citizenship through this amendment.", "Yes, I was trying to understand the connection between this law and then this larger registry.", "The connection is sometimes denied, and some political parties are, in fact, closing their eyes to it. The ruling party in the state of Bihar voted with the government on the Citizenship Amendment bill, and now they are saying they will not accept the National Register of Citizens. That\u2019s a specious argument, in my view, because the two go together. Certainly, in multiple speeches, it has been said that Hindus need not worry, because they will be covered by the Citizenship Amendment Act, but other illegal migrants will not\u2014\u201cother\u201d basically meaning Muslims.", "Including people who have been in the country for generations.", "Across the country, there\u2019s a panic to collect documents, and the panic is mostly to be seen among poorer Muslims.There is a lot of misinformation about this as well. People are lining up outside district offices trying to consult a few records. People are sometimes choosing the wrong documents, which they think will prove their existence as citizens but will not. In Bengal, there have even been suicides by people who were anxious about not having documents.", "Has the rise of the Hindu right, especially over the past couple of decades, made you think differently about the design of the Indian constitution and Indian democracy? Or do you think that any democratic system is vulnerable?", "This is not something that came up only in the last fifteen years. The Hindu-right ideology has been there since the nineteen-twenties. It has never been the dominant strand of political ideology until recently. The Ayodhya movement was really the starting point of the B.J.P.\u2019s growth and its emergence as a strong alternative to the mainstream parties. In the thirties, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar [a leader of the Hindu-nationalist movement] enunciated the idea of the two-nation theory\u2014that Hindus and Muslims are actually two nations\u2014even before the Muslim League [which pushed for the creation of Pakistan] took it up. Today, everyone identifies the two-nation theory with [Pakistan\u2019s founding father] Muhammad Ali Jinnah, but actually it was Savarkar who first articulated the two-nation theory.", "In a sense, the ruling party now actually avows that perspective. It does believe that this is the unfinished business of Partition. They do have a certain adherence to the idea that this is the national homeland of Hindus, and everybody else is a second-class citizen, here only on sufferance. It\u2019s an ideological strand which has been around for a long time. It has not been hegemonic for a long time. It is now hegemonic.", "How much do you think that, especially in the last several decades, the weakness of the \u201csecular\u201d establishment, often in the form of the Congress Party, is responsible for where India is today?", "I think you are absolutely right about that. The Congress Party has been weak in its commitment to secularism. The opening of the locks on the Babri Masjid [the mosque in Ayodhya], for instance, is something that happened in Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s time. What has happened in the last several years is that even avowedly secular politicians are actually pandering to what they see as the Hindu voter bloc, to the point of displaying religiosity publicly in order to not give the impression that they are too pro-Muslim. They perceive the need to do that because the atmosphere has already been shaped, the public discourse has already been shaped, in a way that polarizes. That is the contribution of the ruling party.", "How helpful do you think it is to think about the Hindu right today and the rise of Modi in the same terms that we think of a lot of other right-wing leaders who have risen in the last several years? And how much do you think it\u2019s unique to India?", "There are obvious commonalities that populist leaders share, and right-wing populist leaders in particular share, but I think there\u2019s one aspect that is sui generis and seems very important, which is that, in almost every other place, when there\u2019s anti-immigrant political discourse, it\u2019s against people who are recent entrants into the society. But, in India, the other is not an immigrant; the other was historically a part of the society for hundreds of years. Here it is different, because it is othering people that are your own, and have been your own, and communities that have lived together, even if they\u2019ve lived together separately, for centuries. Our cultures, Islamic and Hindu cultures, are deeply implicated in everything from architecture to cuisine to whatever else. It\u2019s a syncretic culture. It\u2019s very different from countries in Europe.", "That is interesting, although, certainly in Europe, and also certainly in the States, there\u2019s obviously bigotry against people who have been here for hundreds of years.", "In India\u2019s case, it\u2019s both. Right now, with the Citizenship Amendment Act, it is the illegal migrant that is the figure, but that figure then becomes a proxy for the Indian Muslim, who is as much a part of the soil as any of us."]}
