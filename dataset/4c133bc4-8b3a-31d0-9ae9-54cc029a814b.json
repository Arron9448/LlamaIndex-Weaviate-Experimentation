On November 10th, in Berlin, New Hampshire, the sun set at 4:22 P.M. In Littleton, on the far side of the White Mountains, there was a crust of snow on the ground. Among Democratic campaigns and voters, the carnival pageantry of the summer, of state fairs and parades, gave way to an intense theatre of hope, winnowing, and dread. More than a dozen candidates were competing for the nomination, but none had convincingly demonstrated that he or she could build a strong Democratic coalition, let alone defeat Donald Trump. Joe Biden\u2014who, as Barack Obama\u2019s Vice-President, was his most natural successor and who is still first in the national polls\u2014had been campaigning languidly, with periodic outbursts of worrying verbiage, and his standing had deteriorated throughout the year. Bernie Sanders had been off the trail for two weeks in October following a heart attack. Elizabeth Warren, who had gathered strong support with her message about the quiet desperation of the middle class, now seemed to be confusing more voters than she was attracting, by insisting on her plan to dispense with private insurance and replace it, at a cost of more than twenty trillion dollars, with Medicare for All. This fall, as even the prospect of impeachment seemingly did little to erode Donald Trump\u2019s base, Democrats began to notice the void at the center of American politics, and to wonder, with increasing urgency, who might fill it. When, over Veterans Day weekend, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a gay married man and a military veteran with a calm, slightly abstracted manner, boarded his campaign bus for a tour of New Hampshire, he still seemed like a niche candidate, polling in the low teens in the state. He was mostly popular with white professionals, and showed a distinct talent for fund-raising, bringing in more money than any other Democratic candidate in the second quarter of 2019. By Thanksgiving, the race had shifted. Buttigieg was leading by several points in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and he was up to second in a national Quinnipiac poll, which noted that he had become the favored candidate of white voters without college educations, too. The surface absurdity of this situation\u2014that one of the leading candidates for the job of rescuing a free nation from a corrupt would-be authoritarian is a mayor who has never won more than eleven thousand votes in an election\u2014is generally unacknowledged on the campaign trail these days. Buttigieg is thirty-seven, just two years clear of the constitutional minimum for a President. He is small and slight, with thick dark hair, peaked eyebrows, pale skin, and a quiet, anticipatory presence\u2014he is often on the balls of his feet. In New Hampshire, Buttigieg wore a white shirt and a blue tie under an oversized brown leather bomber jacket that looked as if it had been purchased in haste when the cold descended. He followed the pilgrimage trail of a Democrat in a rural state\u2014craft brewery to solar array, craft brewery to solar array\u2014in an unassuming way. He is not an especially physical or energetic performer on the stump; his great gift is his voice, which is deep and relaxed. He often stands with his left shoulder a little slouched and lets a baritone reasonableness suffuse the room. His punch lines sound like observations: \u201cI don\u2019t have to throw myself a military parade to see what a convoy looks like, because I was driving one around Afghanistan\u2014right about the time this President was taping Season 7 of \u2018The Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019 \u201d Voters who come to Buttigieg events tend to know two things about him. The first is that he was something of a boy wonder: an ace literature student at Harvard and a Rhodes Scholar. On the trail, Buttigieg wears his intelligence lightly but insistently. He does not use bookish words, or delve deeply into policy detail, but, early in the race, at the request of an Oslo camera crew, he did speak some words of Norwegian\u2014a language he said he had taught himself in order to read the untranslated work of the novelist Erlend Loe\u2014and when an exchange student from Gaza posed a question about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict he replied, briefly, in Arabic. Of all the aspects of Buttigieg\u2019s persona, the boy-wonder thing is what has most seduced his fans and irritated his opponents, who see it as a way of turning a very fast and self-conscious rise through the establishment into a story of destiny. At the fifth Democratic debate, in November, Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey, who was a two-term mayor of Newark, pointed out that he, too, was a Rhodes Scholar, and that he had served as mayor of \u201cthe largest city in my state.\u201d (South Bend, with a population of a hundred and one thousand, is the fourth-largest city in Indiana, right behind Evansville.) Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who is running toward the bottom of the pack, was characteristically blunt about the modesty of her rival\u2019s current office. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard,\u201d she said. The second thing that voters know about Buttigieg is more meaningful: that he hopes to embody what one of his senior strategists described to me as \u201cthe yearning for reconciliation.\u201d Waiting to hear Buttigieg speak at the refurbished Rex Theatre, in Manchester, New Hampshire, Dan Chase, fifty-six, told me, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2014I voted for Trump and I\u2019m embarrassed about it.\u201d But if the President embarrassed him, Sanders and Warren spooked him: \u201cThey are way out there.\u201d Standing next to Chase was Mary Kate Roukey, twenty-three, who had favored Warren until she heard the details of Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plan, which seemed, she said dubiously, \u201csuper-ambitious.\u201d Onstage, Buttigieg said that the coming years would require a President \u201cwho can stand on the rubble of what has been busted in our society and in our politics, pick up the pieces, implement bold solutions, get something done about those issues, and\u201d\u2014he leaned hard on the word\u2014\u201cfind a way to do it that\u2019s actually going to unify the American people. The good news I\u2019m offering you is that can happen\u2014that will happen\u2014when I\u2019m your President.\u201d There was a round of applause. Watch Buttigieg long enough and you notice that he uses abstraction as an escape hatch. Above the quotidian divisions of politics, he describes a realm where all Americans are one. His campaign has failed dismally to attract African-American voters\u2014according to one recent poll, his support among black Democrats in South Carolina is at less than one per cent\u2014so I asked him what themes helped him make a connection with them. \u201cA really big one is faith,\u201d he said. What common ground could he offer Republicans, given his progressive policy ideas? \u201cI think appealing to family and family values is really important to me,\u201d he replied. It was like watching a pilot, once all normal systems had failed, push the button on an ejector seat. These appeals to old-fashioned American values are his most politician-like habit, and they give his language a touch of nostalgia. At the Rex Theatre, Buttigieg took questions from the audience. The microphone was passed to an older man in the back, a self-declared Republican who said that he would not vote for Donald Trump next year (lusty applause). He went on to say that he had observed rising interest costs and wanted to know whether Buttigieg was taking them seriously. Buttigieg furrowed his brow. For weeks, he had been talking about bringing \u201cRepublicans of conscience\u201d into his campaign, and here was an ideal specimen. \u201cThe lesson I take from seeing what the Washington Republicans are doing is: if Democrats don\u2019t start caring about deficits and the debt, that will mean nobody does,\u201d Buttigieg told him. Fiscal \u201ctime bombs\u201d will go off sooner or later. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m being very careful about the promises that I make on the campaign trail.\u201d \u201cI see you vaping in there.\u201d Cartoon by Kim Warp For a moment it seemed that Buttigieg, in his eagerness to please, might have followed the Republican of conscience into an outright conservative position. \u201cStill big!\u201d he said hastily of his plans, and assured the audience that his health-care proposal, Medicare for All Who Want It, would be \u201cthe biggest thing we\u2019ve done in fifty years.\u201d Part of the tension in Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is simple: he hopes to echo the transformative promises of the Warren and Sanders campaigns while appealing to the moderate voters who might well decide the general election. But Buttigieg would say that he is practicing a type of politics that has been all but abandoned since Trump\u2019s election\u2014in which the role of a candidate is not to champion a movement but to steer a consensus. He is slow to take a side. In recent weeks, his campaign has had the useful effect of putting before many mainstream Democrats the question of whether an uplifting figure, young and unifying, was truly whom they wanted as their candidate.", "As Buttigieg began rising in the polls, his staff invited groups of reporters onto the campaign bus for a rolling on-the-record conversation that lasted, one Sunday, for more than four and a half hours. The idea had been championed by Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s communications director, who is a year younger than he but is a veteran of New York politics and of Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. On the bus, Smith was an antic, profane presence. \u201cYou ingrates!\u201d she mock-howled at us, when she realized that no reporter had thanked her for all the access. When I asked Smith if the tour had been modelled on John McCain\u2019s Straight Talk Express, of 2000, she replied, \u201cObvi,\u201d but Buttigieg is a less chummy presence than McCain. \u201cHe\u2019ll tease the press,\u201d David Foster Wallace wrote of McCain on the trail, in 2000, \u201cand give them shit in a way they don\u2019t ever mind because it\u2019s the sort of shit that makes you feel that here\u2019s this very cool, important guy who\u2019s noticing you and liking you enough to give you shit.\u201d Buttigieg gave no one shit. Everyone grew slightly more formal in his presence. He settled into a seat, steepled his fingers, and waited. It took a little time for the conversation to focus. Buttigieg can give a thoughtful answer to almost any question, but he rarely tells a joke or heartfelt accounts of the people he meets on the trail. He doesn\u2019t gossip. When reporters ask him to comment about a development of the day, he says something generic, or just backs away from it. He\u2019s far more interested in the broad sweep of social experience and political history. Eventually, I asked him to explain why so many Democrats want \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d in Warren\u2019s phrasing, or a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d in Sanders\u2019s. As Buttigieg told it, the story began in his childhood, with Ronald Reagan\u2019s Administration, and stretched through the Obama years\u2014a decades-long period that he described as the Reagan era, a time of neoliberal consensus around free-market capitalism and of escalating inequality. \u201cA lot of it is Trump, but I think it\u2019s really a reaction to forty years of dismantling social democracy,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe\u2019re reaping the consequences of them hollowing out so many of these things. And sometimes that expresses itself in very perverse ways, like it helps lead to Trump, who\u2019s going to make it worse.\u201d Obama, he noted, ushered in major financial and health-care reforms, but, in a matter of months, he was hamstrung by a Republican Senate majority that was obsessed with conservative fiscal policy and refused to work with the White House. \u201cWe saw real progress, but it was constrained,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s true that we didn\u2019t fully anticipate the bad faith of Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate.\u201d His voice rose to a more speculative tone. He thought the problem was partly that the George W. Bush years had been characterized by \u201czealotry, which is different from cynicism. In other words, you had\u2014especially with the neocons\u2014these true believers kind of fanatically pulling us in a direction that I think was terrible, but there\u2019s a sense that was what they truly believed.\u201d With Trump, and with McConnell, Buttigieg said, \u201cthere\u2019s so little good faith that it\u2019s just different than a strong contest of ideas.\u201d He had worked himself around to one of the central tensions of his candidacy: how a politics of unity could work at a time of extreme partisanship. Buttigieg\u2019s theory seems to be that change will take place on two tracks. He has proposed radical reforms to the political system: abolishing the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote and changing the composition of the Supreme Court. For the Court, he has suggested giving five seats to each party and creating five more seats, for federal judges who would rotate through on one-year appointments. \u201cI believe I have an obligation to start building the case for that even if it won\u2019t arrive for quite a while,\u201d he said. In the meantime, he plans to pursue a more pragmatic agenda based on public support for gun-law reform, action on climate change, and heavier taxation of the very wealthy. He sometimes says that as President he would often fly to red states to pressure recalcitrant members of Congress. On the bus, someone asked him if that would actually work. \u201cEven compared to the last time we had a Democratic President, people have moved in our direction on the issues,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been zero extent to which that\u2019s been tracked by a movement among Republicans in Congress. So I do think that showing up in areas where you can create pressure, even in areas where you\u2019re going to be unpopular, is going to be really important for combatting polarization as well as for getting an agenda through.\u201d If you squinted, you could start to see the outlines of a Buttigieg Presidency: uplifting talk about generational change, and an incrementalist approach to policy. At each stop in New Hampshire, a few reporters got off the bus, and a few others got on, and there would be another round of newsy questions. Eventually, the deeper topics would be picked up again. Buttigieg answered everything in the same ultra-thoughtful tone, so that we went down a few rabbit holes. At one point, he tried to recall exactly how he had responded to a bully who shoved him when he was thirteen or fourteen. When Buttigieg whirled around to confront him, had he hit the kid or just stared him down? A Presidential-summit-level intensity set in. Asked which hymn he liked best, Buttigieg named one that he\u2019d learned in Welsh, and then was embarrassed that he couldn\u2019t remember the words in English. The conversation moved on. Chicken wings were distributed. Someone cracked open a White Claw hard seltzer. As we headed over the White Mountains, a young CNN reporter tentatively referred to the healing that the candidate said he has been seeing under way in the country. Buttigieg\u2019s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a thirty-year-old schoolteacher, comes from a conservative Michigan family that struggled at first with Chasten\u2019s sexuality. But now, Buttigieg had been saying on the stump, Chasten\u2019s parents had embraced the couple, and the candidate planned to go deer-hunting on Thanksgiving morning with his father-in-law. \u201cHave you spoken to Chasten\u2019s brother lately?\u201d the reporter asked. He was referring to Rhyan Glezman, a born-again Christian pastor who has appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show, and who told the Washington Post, \u201cI just don\u2019t support the gay lifestyle.\u201d Would he be coming to Thanksgiving dinner? Many politicians, when asked a delicate question, pause, as they weigh what they want to say, and the sympathies their answer might provoke, and then the antagonisms. \u201cWell . . . ,\u201d they begin, and then they inhale, and we wait. \u201cBuffering,\u201d the MSNBC host Chris Hayes recently called it, referring to Obama, who does it often. Buttigieg did it now. Eventually, he said, \u201cI think that part of my Thanksgiving will stay off the record.\u201d The bus went quiet, and he sat there a little stiffly, no longer so pure an embodiment of the yearning for reconciliation.", "The central parable of the modern Democratic Party is of the young prodigy who returns home to a scene of decline. It is Bill Clinton, from \u201ca place called Hope,\u201d in Arkansas. The tale gets told even when the facts don\u2019t exactly fit\u2014when the politician is Cory Booker, for example, who has supplanted his middle-class upbringing in the New Jersey suburbs with his decades in Newark. One of the first ads that the Obama campaign released in Iowa in 2007 featured the Harvard constitutional-law professor Laurence Tribe, praising his former student\u2019s decision to settle in Chicago. \u201cIt was inspiring, absolutely inspiring, to see someone as brilliant as Barack Obama, as successful, someone who could\u2019ve written his ticket on Wall Street, take all of the talent and all of the learning and decide to devote it to the community and to making people\u2019s lives better,\u201d Tribe said. The parable is about selflessness, but it isn\u2019t just that. The country is politically divided, between the cities and the countryside, and the coasts and the heartland, in ways that, because of the distribution of electoral power, have mostly benefitted Republicans. Hence the desire for the liberal prodigy, and hence the unusual expectations on him (so far, he has almost always been male): that, having returned to a struggling place, he could learn to express the sensations of both sides, ambition and loss. Pete Buttigieg was born in South Bend in 1982, the son of two Notre Dame professors, Joseph Buttigieg, a Maltese immigrant and a scholar and translator of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci; and Anne Montgomery, an Indiana native and a linguist. Buttigieg notes in his elegant campaign memoir, \u201cShortest Way Home,\u201d that the central trauma of South Bend, the closure of the Studebaker plant\u2014which resulted in the loss of seven thousand jobs\u2014occurred in the sixties, decades before he was born. \u201cGrowing up in any place with a lost golden age, you absorb its legacy in fragments, hearing once-great names\u2014Oliver, Morris, Bendix, Studebaker\u2014without being able to match them to anything living,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou take them in at first without comprehension, like the names of the saints.\u201d His family stayed in \u201cSouth Bend proper,\u201d near Notre Dame, even as many white families moved to the suburbs, and he was intensely aware of the deterioration of downtown: \u201cYou no longer went to get your first Communion suit from Gilbert\u2019s or Robertson\u2019s downtown anymore, you went instead to J.C. Penney at the mall in nearby Mishawaka.\u201d De-industrialization had more severe effects in South Bend than the occasional trip to Mishawaka\u2014in 2011, black poverty spiked to fifty-three per cent\u2014but Buttigieg says little in the book about the African-American experience. He recently acknowledged that, as mayor, he was \u201cslow to realize\u201d that, in part because of white flight, the public schools in his county were effectively segregated. In 2004, Buttigieg graduated from Harvard, where he was the student president of the Institute of Politics, a nonpartisan center founded in honor of John F. Kennedy. For a young political hopeful, it was a heady but circumscribed time\u2014Democrats seemed desperately in need of big ideas, but the center of the country was still understood to be pretty conservative. Buttigieg started a group with some college friends, the Democratic Renaissance Project, whose members read up on John Dewey, Louis Brandeis, and other liberal intellectual icons, and tried to imagine how Democrats might reclaim the initiative. K. Sabeel Rahman, a member of the Renaissance Project who is now a professor at Brooklyn Law School and the president of the liberal think tank Demos, told me, \u201cThere seemed to be all these crises\u2014the Iraq War, the Bush tax cuts, the sanctioning of torture\u2014and yet it felt like conservative ideas were ascendant and progressive ones kept losing, in part because we kept moderating ourselves and stayed within the bounds of a generally conservative world view.\u201d Obama\u2019s election in 2008 provoked hope and then some anxiety in Buttigieg\u2019s circle. Rahman said, \u201cThere was a sense that the infrastructure of progressive ideas was not set up yet\u2014that Obama had arrived after thirty years of Reaganism, while F.D.R. had followed thirty years of progressive agitation.\u201d Buttigieg pursued his interest in political theory as a Rhodes Scholar, studying in the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics program at Oxford. He also wanted \u201can education in the real world, if there was such a thing,\u201d he writes. This led him to a two-and-a-half-year stint at the Chicago office of McKinsey & Company, the prestigious American consulting firm, known for its discreet counsel to the world\u2019s most powerful governments and corporations. It was a deeply conventional choice for an ambitious Harvard graduate, and Buttigieg has struggled to explain it to progressives. McKinsey\u2019s reputation has been badly tarnished by recent reports that it has advised state-owned companies in China and Russia and the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, and that it helped Trump\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency identify \u201cdetention savings opportunities,\u201d including cuts to food and medical care for detainees. Under pressure from Elizabeth Warren and the Times editorial board, Buttigieg released a summary of his work at McKinsey, and then a list of clients, which included Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Best Buy, and the U.S. Postal Service. While working for another client, the Defense Department, in 2009, he travelled to Iraq and Afghanistan as part of an economic-development project. Buttigieg moved back to South Bend in 2007, when he was twenty-five. It was time, he writes, to seek out \u201cthe things that mattered most.\u201d Contemplating how few Harvard graduates now served in the military, he signed up for the Navy Reserve and began training as an intelligence officer. It cannot have been lost on him that his service would be an asset for a political career. In 2010, Buttigieg was the Democratic nominee for Indiana\u2019s state treasurer and lost to the incumbent by more than twenty-four points, but two years later he ran in an open mayoral race and won with nearly seventy-four per cent of the vote. Buttigieg governed as a modernizer at a time when cities everywhere are modernizing. As mayor, he widened sidewalks, slowed down traffic, and used tax breaks to attract new businesses. \u201cThe idea was that a city couldn\u2019t thrive without a heart, and that meant making the downtown and the city a place where people wanted to be,\u201d Scott Ford, who helped lead the redevelopment effort, told me. By the most basic measure, Buttigieg\u2019s administration was a success. The economy improved everywhere during his tenure, but it improved a bit more in South Bend, where the unemployment rate dropped from ten per cent to three and a half per cent, and a half-century-long decline in population began to reverse. \u201cBut, centuries from now, will people remember Stickhenge?\u201d Cartoon by Mick Stevens Buttigieg writes with palpable fondness about his time as mayor, but there are discordant notes: in particular, a pattern of friction with the black community, which makes up nearly a third of the city\u2019s population. In the winter of 2012, just weeks after Buttigieg\u2019s inauguration, he learned that federal prosecutors were investigating South Bend\u2019s first black police chief, Darryl Boykins, for recording the phone calls of white officers, who were said to be making racist remarks about Boykins and others. Buttigieg demoted the chief and hired a white replacement. A series of lawsuits followed, and Boykins, the white officers, and several others involved in the scandal received settlements from the city. As for Buttigieg, he has said that he cannot listen to or release the tapes, citing continuing legal restrictions. \u201cIt was right after the murder of Trayvon Martin, and black people were stirred up all over the country,\u201d the Reverend Michael Patton, a longtime South Bend pastor who now leads the city\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. chapter, told me. \u201cWe had a lot of stuff that was going on that was affecting people\u2019s emotions over a ninety-day period, and the Mayor didn\u2019t really seem to understand that context.\u201d Three years later, Buttigieg, speaking about racial reconciliation, used the phrase \u201cAll lives matter\u201d in his State of the City address. He explained this spring that he did not know at that time that the phrase \u201cwas coming to be viewed as a sort of counter-slogan to \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 \u201d In his first term, Buttigieg also clashed with housing activists over a plan to demolish or repair a thousand vacant homes in a thousand days, largely in black and Latino communities. \u201cSome of those homes needed to be knocked down,\u201d Oliver Davis, a South Bend city councilman who has endorsed Biden, told me. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to have a plan to build up those neighborhoods.\u201d Several local officials and activists contested Buttigieg\u2019s narrative of the city\u2019s recovery, pointing out that black residents had not fared so well. The black poverty and black unemployment rates remain in the double digits. \u201cHe was not aware of how much animosity there is out in the community,\u201d Jorden Giger, a Black Lives Matter activist in South Bend who supports Sanders, said. \u201cWhen you finally see the faces at the bottom of the well, he\u2019s not prepared for that\u2014he\u2019s not prepared for that visceral reaction to his policies, because for so long he\u2019s had people in his ear telling him that what he\u2019s doing is good.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s memoir suggests that, during his years in South Bend, his technocratic persona softened. \u201cA person aided by data can make fairer and smarter decisions,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut only a person can sense when an unexplainable factor ought to come into play.\u201d Midway through his first term, he was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months. As an intelligence analyst, he spent some of his time \u201cbehind a sophisticated computer terminal in a secure area,\u201d but he also made dozens of dangerous forays in convoys into Kabul. Those assignments, he writes, \u201cforced me to think about the cohesion, or lack thereof, in my life.\u201d He had told a few friends that he was gay but feared \u201cprofessional peril\u201d if he came out. By his own account, the proximity to danger in Afghanistan intensified both his personal and his political ambitions. \u201cI mean, you only get one turn at life, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI think I always felt that way. I felt that way more once I got back from the deployment.\u201d Buttigieg came out to his parents in early 2015, and to the public that summer, during his re\u00eblection campaign. He went on to win with more than eighty per cent of the vote, and he married Chasten in 2018, in the Episcopal cathedral downtown. Anne Mannix, a doyenne of housing activists in South Bend, told me with some amazement about accompanying Buttigieg this year to the West Side Democratic and Civic Club\u2019s Dyngus Day celebration, an all-day drinking fest in honor of Polish heritage. \u201cAnd here are all these old Polish guys toasting Pete and Chasten\u2014the Mayor and his husband.\u201d In South Bend, Buttigieg was keeping up the Harvard connections that would help make his high ambitions seem plausible. Through his friend Eric Lesser, who was working in the Obama Administration, he met and impressed Obama\u2019s chief strategist, David Axelrod, who introduced him to Lis Smith. His friend Swati Mylavarapu, a tech founder and investor who was with him at Harvard and Oxford, is his campaign\u2019s investment chair. Another college friend reportedly introduced him to Mark Zuckerberg, who, with his wife, Priscilla Chan, recommended two people who were hired by the campaign. This past September, Buttigieg was asked to define neoliberalism on Twitter, and he replied, \u201cNeoliberalism is the political-economic consensus that has governed the last forty years of policy in the US and UK. Its failure helped to produce the Trump moment. Now we have to replace it with something better.\u201d Neoliberalism might also be defined as the political-economic consensus that allows Mark Zuckerberg to recommend campaign hires to Pete Buttigieg. Some have recently observed that Buttigieg has left behind the politics of his father, the Marxist scholar, who died early this year. (He tends to emphasize his father\u2019s less ideological work, on James Joyce.) \u201cCentrist-child syndrome,\u201d the writer Shuja Haider called it on the Web site the Outline. Buttigieg told me that his father had left a subtler imprint on him. \u201cHe was somebody who was impatient with some of the self-indulgence that had happened in the humanities as it drifted away from a connection to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the books he loved was Edmund Wilson\u2019s \u2018To the Finland Station,\u2019 right? Where you start off with, I think it\u2019s Herder figuring out Vico\u201d\u2014the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder and the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico\u2014\u201cand by the end you\u2019ve got Lenin showing up. The point is that you see how something that starts out really esoteric and academic ends up changing history.\u201d He thought about it a little more. \u201cBut, also, there were times where I would push off from it, too, because he was so furious with what the right has done that you could\u2014you could spoil the taste of a wine for him by telling him it came from a right-wing vineyard.\u201d Buttigieg smiled. \u201cHe was so deep in it.\u201d Buttigieg is often charged with being too young or too inexperienced for the Presidency. In fact, his candidacy poses a slightly different problem: he has not yet fully formed his political identity and, as a Presidential candidate, he is immature. When he was asked on the bus in New Hampshire about his experience, Buttigieg mentioned that he had bought a house before he\u2019d held down a steady job and had gone to war \u201cbefore I had my first experience being in love.\u201d He said, \u201cI guess I\u2019m comfortable doing things in a way that\u2019s kind of out of order.\u201d", "Buttigieg\u2019s lack of connection with African-American voters, which began as a problem in South Bend, has become his campaign\u2019s outstanding weak point. This past June, while he was in New York, a white South Bend police officer shot and killed a black man in his fifties named Eric Logan. Buttigieg rushed back and attended a public event, where Logan\u2019s mother, Shirley Newbill, said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve been here my whole life, and you all don\u2019t do a damn thing about me or my son or none of these people out here.\u201d At a fiery town hall a few days later, Buttigieg was shouted down as a \u201cliar\u201d and told, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust you.\u201d I asked Buttigieg if he saw the potential for reconciliation between South Bend\u2019s police force and its African-American community. \u201cOne thing that I do think animates all of this is a sense of the desire for safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThat desire to come home safe is something we can all come back to. But it\u2019s still such a gulf to try to bridge.\u201d He had pressed the ejector button, but nothing had happened. Igor Rodriguez, a local forty-one-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, told me, \u201cPeople in South Bend are tired of feeling silenced, and people in South Bend are tired of talking about Pete Buttigieg instead. This is a person who has built his career for over a year on talking about how he fixed everything in South Bend.\u201d He added, \u201cHe really shot himself in the foot, because, guess what, we can talk, too.\u201d By Thanksgiving, voters in New Hampshire were asking Buttigieg about his failure to attract black supporters. His efforts at outreach often seemed ham-fisted or contrived, and they left a series of insults and mini-scandals in their wake. Late in October, McClatchy reported that Buttigieg\u2019s polling firm had conducted focus groups with black voters in South Carolina and written a memo concluding that Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cbeing gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it.\u201d This was instantly interpreted as an effort to shift blame for Buttigieg\u2019s failings with African-Americans to their supposed discomfort with gay rights. The campaign circulated a letter of support for its racial-justice plan, the Douglass Plan. Named after the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, it promises a wide range of criminal-justice reforms and education, jobs, health, and housing programs. The campaign\u2019s letter had been signed by more than four hundred South Carolinians. But the online publication the Intercept found that nearly half the signatories were white, and spoke to one \u201csignatory,\u201d Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party\u2019s Black Caucus, who said that he had not consented to have his name attached. \u201cIt\u2019s presumptuous to think you can come up with a plan for black America without hearing from black folk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of people telling us what we need. You wanna find out what we need? Come and ask us.\u201d (The campaign later removed Cordero\u2019s name from the letter.) In mid-November, Buttigieg spoke at the historically black Morehouse College, in downtown Atlanta, to about two hundred students. It was an earnest, tedious affair. Buttigieg uncorked his stump speech, to little effect. The Douglass Plan, he said, is \u201cas ambitious as the Marshall Plan, but this time investing right here at home.\u201d Such flourishes led to little audible response. In the spirit of Atlanta\u2019s first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, he said, his Administration would set aside twenty-five per cent of federal contracts for minority-owned businesses. There was no applause. He offered his support for H.R. 40, a bill before the House that would require the federal government to undertake a formal study of reparations for slavery. The idea just washed over the audience and out the back. Buttigieg wasn\u2019t bombing, exactly. But his instincts and ideas were not connecting with his audience. After the event, Ted Winn, a former Morehouse student, said that he liked the Mayor\u2019s \u201cpliability,\u201d but that the reparations answer struck him as a cop-out. \u201cThat bill is just like a safe space for Democrats who won\u2019t go further,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all have specific plans for health care and the economy. Why not for this?\u201d Christopher Jackson, a sophomore, said that he had been more impressed by Buttigieg than he expected, but that the plan to expand the Supreme Court sounded like \u201cscience fiction.\u201d Jackson went on, \u201cThey say he\u2019s a pragmatist, but then, on issues like the Court, he actually goes further than everyone else.\u201d The fifth Democratic debate was held two days later, at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, which are housed in a former military complex. The setting emphasized the relationship between the Party and its African-American base, and Buttigieg seemed determined to do better. It took a while for the debate to work its way around to Buttigieg, and to race, but when it did he turned from the idea of shared values to his own experience of marginalization. \u201cWhile I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me.\u201d For that night, perhaps, it was good enough. But if this was the message for the long run, it seemed less sturdy, in part because Buttigieg was applying the optimism of the most immediately successful civil-rights struggle in American history, the movement for gay marriage, to its most enduring and frequently betrayed one, the campaign for black equality. After Thanksgiving, Buttigieg toured the South again, trying to find the resonant chords. A new TV ad in South Carolina led with faith, featuring footage in which Buttigieg asked, \u201cWhatever happened to \u2018I was hungry, and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me\u2019?\u201d On a visit to the new National Memorial for Peace and Justice, in Montgomery, Alabama, which honors victims of racial violence, he reflected that the memorial is \u201ca reminder of the unspeakable harm done by white supremacy in this country. But it is also a reminder that things from hundreds of years ago and things going on today are all connected.\u201d He spent Sunday, December 1st, in Goldsboro, North Carolina, at the church of the Reverend Dr. William Barber, the progressive civil-rights leader who is working to revive Martin Luther King, Jr.,\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign. When I talked to Barber a few days later, he praised Buttigieg\u2019s willingness to speak directly about poverty: \u201cHe said the word \u2018poor,\u2019 didn\u2019t play around with it.\u201d Cartoon by Roz Chast Buttigieg\u2019s efforts to win over black voters were starting to seem a little like a kid fumbling with a Rubik\u2019s Cube: he was going to do everything he could to solve the problem, and it probably wasn\u2019t going to work. \u201cNothing operates in isolation,\u201d Marc Morial, a former mayor of New Orleans and the president of the National Urban League, told me. \u201cHe starts with no track record in the African-American community on a national basis. You\u2019ve got black candidates in the race. You\u2019ve got Joe Biden, who\u2019s got a Rolodex of relationships. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been out there hustling for several years. For many African-American voters, familiarity breeds trust, because of the habit of many elected officials to promise extravagantly and deliver meagrely.\u201d In Morial\u2019s view, it will take Buttigieg more than a few months to win African-American votes. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly working,\u201d Morial said. \u201cHe\u2019s a new figure who is certainly evolving.\u201d"]}
