Memphis was radical and rule-less, and tried to break free from modernist design,\u201d says Stockholm-based designer Gustaf Westman. His Curvy Mirror \u2013 majestic in scale, playful in shape \u2013 has become a staple in countless chic Scandinavian homes, and is as ubiquitous and commanding as another cult favourite mirror, Ettore Sottsass\u2019s Ultrafragola. Other Westman pieces that play with wiggly forms include an oversized Curvy Room Divider with undulating lines in soft pastel hues reminiscent of the work of midcentury designer Joamin Baumann, and wriggly side tables with both a curvy base and tabletop.", "Sophie Lou Jacobsen Glass Wave Pitcher, $215", "Another outfit pairing serpentine forms with light, fresh pastels is Wiggle Room, which makes wiggly-topped dining, coffee and side tables in Connecticut. The tables are inspired by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx and the wavy modernist landscapes he created with the native flora of Brazil. \u201cSome would say he painted with plants. We wanted to bring some of his magic indoors with our organic wiggly tables,\u201d says co-founder Zoe Cohen.

They launched their pieces last year during lockdown, seeing the need for having more fun in our homes. \u201cBeing inside during lockdown made people say, \u2018I have this space, it\u2019s my space, it should be my sanctuary.\u2019 Having dark times outside was a chance to create a joyful, colourful world inside.\u201d", "Having dark times outside was a chance to create a joyful, colourful world inside\u201d", "Influenced by artist Paul Feeley, Ettore Sottsass, the Bauhaus and even quotidian things such as the pastel hue of a scoop of pistachio ice cream, they design curvy, colourful made-to-order pieces. This approach puts them in close contact with their clients, allowing them to build relationships and offer advice. One example of this exchange is what was once its Wiggly Plant Pedestal. After seeing all the different ways in which customers have used them \u2013 from speaker stand to mini bookshelves \u2013 it\u2019s now simply the Wiggly Pedestal. The bicoloured lacquered stands come in any combination of lilac, pale green, orange, pistachio, light blue and pink.

Accessibility to good design is as much an inspiration as the idea of constant experimentation and discovery. \u201cHaving worked in the design industry post-grad for a few years, I felt extremely burnt out by its exclusivity. I vowed to make my work accessible to all,\u201d says one such designer, 24-year-old Brooklyn-based Sophie Coll\u00e9, who launched her practice last summer.", "Wiggle room Birch dining table, $1,280 \u00a9 Jared Kocka", "\u201cMy initial intention was not only to produce work that brought a dash of colour, humour and hope to people\u2019s homes, but also to fundraise for social-justice organisations, mutual aid and bailout funds for protesters,\u201d explains Coll\u00e9 of her clever, playful pieces. Her catalogue includes all manner of imaginative designs \u2013 wiggly plant stands, colourful geometric chairs, coat racks formed from a delightful kaleidoscope of shapes.", "This is true of her custom work as well. Recent pieces include a wriggly pink radiator cover decorated with pastel blobs and checkerboard and cow-print cutouts, and a sideboard bookshelf with a silhouette so wavy it would not be entirely surprising to see it wiggle away. As Coll\u00e9 says, these designs are about redefining what people expect to see in their homes: \u201cI think any area of the house can always afford some curvature and colour!\u201d"], "authors": ["Cherish Rufus"], "keywords": ["pieces", "curvy", "furniture", "gets", "wiggle", "design", "work", "mirror", "wiggly", "tables", "homes", "room"], "pubDate": "2021-04-17T09:55:05Z", "publicationId": "eaa33b83-3927-3aaf-af4b-4990c79485da"}
