This so disgusted the hotel\u2019s management that they drained the entire thing. This story, which was also depicted in the HBO biopic about her life, has never actually been confirmed. But to anyone familiar with the history of America\u2019s relationship with its Black citizens, the anecdote is believable. Maybe it ain\u2019t true, but it also ain\u2019t exactly a lie.", "To question whether this bottomless skepticism is justified is like asking whether a cow has cause to be wary of butchers. From redlining and gerrymandering to the Tuskegee experiment and Cointelpro, the proven conspiracies against Black Americans are so devious, so deep and so absurd that they blast open pathways for true-sounding non-truths to enter, too.", "The terrible spoken word poems I wrote in college (\u201cWe\u2019ll never get justice, because justice for just-us just-aint-for-us\u201d) habitually referenced the so-called Willie Lynch letter \u2014 an instruction manual for controlling Black slaves that I, along with many others, believed was written by a slave owner in 1712 and contained deep insights into modern race relations. The truth: Willie Lynch never existed and the document was forged. I believed that the government conspired to track my thoughts and movements \u2014 as if my flaccid stanzas and banded collar Wilsons Leather biker jackets were a threat to the state. I even once allowed myself to entertain an argument that the natural color of milk is not white, but brown. (Don\u2019t ask.)", "The term \u201chotep\u201d has become a catchall among Black people to describe other Black people who still believe some of these easily debunked stories \u2014 but the reality is that most of us have some hotep in us. And not because we don\u2019t know how America really works, but because we know too much. The lack of trust in our nation\u2019s systems and structures is a force field; a bulwark shielding us from the lie of the American dream. And nowhere is this skepticism more justified than with the institution of medicine.", "I don\u2019t trust doctors, nurses, physician assistants, hospitals, emergency rooms, waiting rooms, surgeries, prescriptions, X-rays, MRIs, medical bills, insurance companies or even the food from hospital cafeterias. My awareness of the pronounced racial disparities in our health care system strips me of any confidence I would have otherwise had in it. As critics of a recent Saturday Night Live skit suggesting that Black people are illogically set against getting vaccinated pointed out, the vaccine hesitancy isn\u2019t due to some uniquely Black pathology. It\u2019s a direct response to centuries of anecdote, experience and data. (Also, the demographic among the least likely to get a vaccine? White evangelicals.)"], "authors": ["Damon Young"], "keywords": ["makes", "black", "pool", "racism", "trust", "times", "rooms", "york", "willie", "question", "lynch", "skepticism", "dont", "vaccine", "covid", "white"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
