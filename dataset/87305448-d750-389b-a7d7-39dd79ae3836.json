I was the assistant to three people\u2014we were four in total.\u201d", "Soon she moved on to become an assistant to the costume designer Dominique Borg, acclaimed for her work on such movies as Bruno Nuytten\u2019s Camille Claudel and Claude Lelouch\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables, and discovered what she felt was her true calling. Her family, meanwhile, had long since moved to a country house in Burgundy, where their neighbor\u2014the aide de camp of Monaco\u2019s Prince Rainier\u2014soon met Karl Lagerfeld, a Monegasque resident and intime of Princess Caroline, the prince\u2019s daughter, and boldly asked him whether he needed an intern. Fatefully, he did. Viard duly went to rue Cambon to meet Lagerfeld\u2019s aide de camp, the patrician Gilles Dufour, who hired her on the spot.", "\u201cImmediately Karl was asking me, \u2018What do you think of this?\u2019 \u2018What do you think of that color?\u2019 I was so embarrassed,\u201d Viard recalls. Her internship soon morphed into a full-time job. \u201cKarl clicked with Virginie immediately,\u201d says Eric Wright, another pillar of Lagerfeld\u2019s design team. \u201cThere\u2019s always been this calmness to Virginie that\u2019s very, very discreet, but her presence and her energy are very, very strong and very influential.\u201d", "At the time, the team was small: Besides Dufour and Wright, there was a ready-to-wear assistant, an accessories designer with an assistant, and Victoire de Castellane, Dufour\u2019s high-spirited niece, then responsible for Chanel\u2019s larger-than-life costume jewelry. Viard soon saw an opportunity that appealed to her training in costume design and her meticulous organizational skills.", "\u201cMy chance was that nobody was in charge of the embroidery,\u201d she says, and so she would be dispatched to work with the formidable Fran\u00e7ois Lesage of the storied embroidery workshop. \u201cHe and Karl were two egos,\u201d Viard recalls. \u201cOoh-la-la! I had to be diplomatic!\u201d", "Viard relished her interactions with the extraordinary characters who provided Chanel with a treasury of handcraft. The button-maker Monsieur Desrues, for instance, who would arrive every day at twelve, bringing his suitcase, which might be empty but for one jewellike example of his art, wrapped in a piece of paper, or Madame Pouzieux, who wove extraordinary braids for the Chanel suits in her atelier above her farmhouse stables in the depths of the French countryside. \u201cI would receive her samples,\u201d says Viard, \u201cand they would smell of her horses\u2026. Luckily, I love horses.\u201d (In recent years, Chanel has acquired 38 of these endangered Maisons d\u2019Art, or craft workshops\u2014including feather- and artificial-flower-makers, custom milliners, glove-makers, pleaters, and textile and footwear designers\u2014and 11 of them will soon be consolidated in 19M, a vast dedicated hub in the north of Paris scheduled to be unveiled next year.)"], "authors": ["Hamish Bowles", "Hamish Bowle"], "keywords": ["work", "soon", "chapter", "viard", "assistant", "chanel", "wright", "virginie", "karl", "costume", "woman", "chanels", "recalls"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
