He was the longest-serving royal consort in British history, the family\u2019s patriarch and a well-known figure in public life for two-thirds of a century until his final disappearance into seclusion in 2019.", "This was a marathon stint on which he had originally embarked with resignation, in the belief that a life of walking several steps behind his wife, curbing his opinions \u2013 though not always his tongue \u2013 and being an appendage to the institution, without even being able to pass on his surname to his children, would turn him into \u201cnothing but a bloody amoeba\u201d.", "Things did not work out that badly. He brought a relaxed, mostly affable, peppery, outspoken \u2013 and occasionally brusque \u2013 style to a ceremonial monarchy that would have been more hidebound, introverted, insipid and decidedly stuffy without him. He introduced badly needed fresh air into the royal family but, while his longevity ensured that he became an integral part of the family firm, he clearly never forgot his initial, impecunious, foreign and outsider status within the institution.", "His dutiful support for his wife and his engagement in public visits, ceremonial occasions and foreign trips continued well into old age. In 2011, he said in a television interview that he was winding down, but it was not until 2017 that he completed his final public engagement and it was only in January 2019, when he gave up driving after causing a car crash near the Sandringham estate, that he disappeared from view. He became the focus of attention again in February 2021, when he went into King Edward VII\u2019s hospital in central London after an infection.", "Although he came to loathe the media for their intrusiveness, he played a considerable part in dragging the monarchy into the modern age. The pioneering 1969 television documentary Royal Family, scripted by Antony Jay, which charted the royal family\u2019s year, showing them in off-duty, admittedly somewhat stilted moments, had received his support in the face of the disapproval of palace courtiers and advisers. The film was reportedly seen by two-thirds of the population, and was blamed by some commentators for a breakdown in deference towards the royal family.", "The royal family in 1968 at Frogmore, Windsor: the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen, with Prince Edward, seated, and behind them, from left, Princess Anne, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. Photograph: PA", "If his tally of accomplishments was modest, this was at least partly because the role to which he was confined had been diminished. Although Philip was intelligent, with physical presence, energy and a clipped, ironic way of speaking, he took care to conceal his intellectual interests, which included poetry and theology, behind his bluff exterior. He had a fine private art collection, painted a little himself and had a well-thumbed personal library of more than 11,000 books, with perhaps surprising inclusions such as the works of TS Eliot. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he would say. Clerics visiting Balmoral or Sandringham to preach Sunday sermons could be disconcerted by his beady-eyed scrutiny from the front pew and his close questioning over lunch afterwards.", "Though frustrated, particularly in the early years of the reign, by his lack of personal scope, he made the most of the role that was open to him. He was a loyal and closely engaged patron of a wide range of organisations and causes, ranging from the postwar national playing fields movement to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, of which he was patron for 55 years. He was the first UK president of the World Wildlife Fund, from 1961 to 1982, and international president from 1981 to 1996.", "After giving up polo in his late 40s, he took up carriage driving, and was instrumental in formalising it as a competitive sport. His book Thirty Years On and Off the Box Seat was published in 2004, and he continued to drive into his 90s. In 1967, he helped set up the Maritime Trust, concerned with the conservation of historic vessels, and as patron of the National Maritime Museum, in Greenwich, he was involved in the work to save the tea clipper Cutty Sark from being dismantled.", "02:58 The life of Prince Philip, the Queen\u2019s \u2018strength and stay\u2019 \u2013 video obituary", "Most enduring and significant was his commitment to the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s award scheme, which he founded in 1956 with the German educationist Kurt Hahn, to create a \u201cdo-it-yourself kit in the art of civilised living\u201d. The programme, operating in more than 140 countries, encourages young people to volunteer for community service and stretch themselves in teamwork and outdoor activities. Since the scheme\u2019s beginnings, more than 4 million teenagers have participated, and the duke continued to present gold awards to the highest achievers into his 90s.", "The Duke of Edinburgh playing polo at Smith\u2019s Lawn, Windsor Great Park, 1970.

I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not going to stick my neck out and do anything as stupid as that, and everybody saying \u201cAh! Silly ass,\u201d you know?\u2019\u201d And Philip was perhaps right to think of popular reaction, because he is likely to be remembered most for what the media reported as his public gaffes: sayings, some spoken with naval quarterdeck briskness, some delighting in situational humour, some just \u2013 as he himself would have phrased it \u2013 \u201cbloody rude\u201d, though these latter were generally directed at members of the officer class rather than ratings.", "Quite often they were embellished, even invented, in the telling, and often the outrage they were said to cause was largely synthetic. Usually the barked questions and brusque comments were the ironic if ill-judged remarks of a bored man seeking to spark a conversation, or just elicit a response, beyond the usual anodyne exchanges of a royal visit.", "The Duke of Edinburgh competing in the dressage section of the carriage driving event at the Windsor Horse Show in 1987.

He was understandably irked when it was reported that he had told some deaf children standing near a steel band, \u201cOf course you\u2019re deaf if you stand there,\u201d pointing out that he was hardly likely to have said it, as a patron of the RNID whose mother had been deaf. But he did not complain.", "Philip\u2019s 1971 biographer, Basil Boothroyd, claimed that he inherited an \u201cundisguised contempt for ignorance, stupidity, inefficiency or deviousness in others\u201d from his father, Prince Andrew of Greece, although he could occasionally display negative traits himself when bored or impatient. More likely though, considering how absent his father was for most of his life, they were a carapace to cover the insecurities of childhood.", "One of his nicknames was \u201cPhil the Greek\u201d, based on his birth on Corfu into Greece\u2019s royal family, yet he had no Greek blood. He was a sprig of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburgs, the peripatetic and frequently exiled Danish royal family that the Greeks imported after winning independence from Turkey in the 1820s.", "His ancestry lay in the interconnected 19th-century royal families of Europe. His paternal grandfather was Danish, his grandmother Russian: the couple\u2019s seven children spoke in Greek to each other but in English to their parents, whose own private conversations were in German.", "Philip\u2019s accent was that of a bluff upper-class Englishman, but he was also fluent in German and French and had some Greek. His grandfather Prince William of Denmark \u2013 whose sister Alexandra married the British king Edward VII \u2013 was invited by the government in Athens to become king of Greece in 1863 when he was 17. William was a disposable younger son, so his family said yes.", "He married the Grand Duchess Olga, a granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I. Yet one of their daughters wrote: \u201cHe always drilled into us that we were Greek and nothing else.\u201d One of their disposable younger sons, Andrew, was to become Prince Philip\u2019s father. Andrew trained as a soldier, speaking Greek as his first language. He married Princess Alice of Battenberg, sister of Lord Louis Mountbatten, later Earl Mountbatten of Burma.", "Christened Philippos, Philip was his parents\u2019 only son, after four daughters. By then his grandfather, who ruled Greece as George I, had been assassinated by a Greek in 1913, and his successor, Philip\u2019s uncle Constantine, had been deposed four years later for failing to support the allied powers, including Britain and France, in the first world war.", "After the three-year reign of his second son, Alexander, Constantine was reinstated by referendum in 1920. Two years later he was again overthrown, in a military upheaval. George V of Britain, son of great-aunt Alexandra, sent a naval cruiser to rescue Andrew, who was facing trial for treason, and his young family. The year-old Philip was placed in an orange box and rowed out to the ship with the rest of the family.", "Prince Philip of Greece in traditional costume, c1930. Photograph: AP", "Permanent exile was to be the first experience of Philip\u2019s life. He was brought up in St Cloud, on the edge of Paris. His family lived on the charity of relatives: his elder sisters dressed in hand-me-down clothes. Their father, bereft of military command, had no occupation and abandoned the family, retreating to gamble in the casinos of Monte Carlo. Their mother, Princess Alice, who was deaf, suffered from schizophrenia and was confined to an asylum for much of Philip\u2019s childhood, though she recovered, becoming a nun and setting up an Orthodox nursing order. She would eventually go to live at Buckingham Palace, where she died in 1969 at the age of 84.", "Philip grew versed in keeping up appearances while \u201cskint\u201d, one of his favourite words, being shuffled between boarding schools, first in Paris, then Germany and latterly Scotland, and spending his holidays with relatives, including his sisters, two of whom had married into the German aristocracy and whose husbands became Nazis. Once asked about his childhood home in an interview, he replied: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018home\u2019? You get on with it. You do. One does.\u201d", "From early childhood he was taken often to Britain to visit his maternal grandmother, the Marchioness of Milford Haven; her husband (and cousin), Prince Louis of Battenberg, a former first sea lord, had been created marquess in 1917 after anglicising his surname to Mountbatten. When Philip was asked to tea at Buckingham Palace, Queen Mary found him \u201ca nice little boy with very blue eyes\u201d.", "He grew up a male tearaway in a female-dominated family. A report from his first school in Paris found him rugged, boisterous, full of energy, polite. After an English preparatory school, Cheam, he went to a secondary school founded in Germany by Hahn. In 1934, he was transferred to Gordonstoun, the Scottish boarding school Hahn established after his exile as a Jew from Germany. It was the nearest thing to an unchanging home for Philip and he was strongly influenced by its values.", "Prince Philip of Greece, seated, in costume for a school production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun, 1935. Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images", "Hahn\u2019s vision was to \u201cbuild up the imagination of the boy of decision and the willpower of the dreamer \u2026 so that in future, wise men will have the nerve to lead the way that they have shown and men of action will have the vision to imagine the consequences of their decisions\u201d. Hahn also spoke of \u201ctraining soldiers who at the same time are lovers of peace\u201d.", "He sought to instil a commitment to public service, self-reliance and self-control in his pupils \u2013 only 30 of them in Philip\u2019s day. Hahn\u2019s influence can be seen in the duke\u2019s award scheme, in Philip\u2019s interest in outdoor activities and in his choice of Gordonstoun for his sons\u2019 education. Philip had loved the school \u2013 he said it brought him intense happiness and excitement.", "Philip stayed with English relatives, family friends and sometimes with the bursar of Gordonstoun. All of them found him cheerfully adaptable, with no aristocratic conceit. His cousin Alexandra, Queen of Yugoslavia, remembered him, on holiday with her family in Venice, as \u201ca huge, hungry dog, perhaps a friendly collie who never had a basket of his own\u201d. His liking for women also stood out. \u201cBlondes, brunettes, red-headed charmers, Philip gallantly and quite impartially squired them all,\u201d according to Alexandra.", "He entered the Royal Navy aged 17. His uncle Louis Mountbatten, who had taken over his upbringing and was ever anxious to act as royal fixer-in-chief, claimed this was due to his influence, but Philip disliked being thought of as dependent on him. Philip came 16th out of 34 successful candidates in the navy\u2019s Dartmouth exams after studying at a crammer. While his spelling was atrocious, he got almost full marks in the examination interview. He took care to stress that he had been following his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s, rather than his uncle\u2019s, example. Philip said: \u201cI suspect [Mountbatten] tried too hard to make a son of me.\u201d", "He was first introduced to the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth during a royal visit to the college. Maybe she was more smitten with the handsome, blond, blue-eyed youth, five years older than her, than he was with the adolescent princess. Nothing in his copious later utterances hinted at a romantic nature, and the Dartmouth meeting turned out to have been engineered by Mountbatten.", "Philip Mountbatten, second from left, with, from left, Princess Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth, King George VI and Princess Margaret at Buckingham Palace, 1947. Photograph: Popperfoto", "Philip won two awards at Dartmouth as best cadet and was enlisted as a midshipman on the eve of the second world war. Kept away from naval action until Greece entered the war, he had his first taste of gunfire off Libya and Sicily, and became one of the navy\u2019s youngest first lieutenants.", "As second-in-command of HMS Wallace during the allied landings in Sicily in July 1943, he helped save many lives by launching a wooden raft to burn, give off smoke and act as a decoy to a German bomber. He spent much of the war patrolling for U-boats in the North Sea. In 1942, he saw Elizabeth again, at a dance at the Duke of Kent\u2019s home. Within two years he had become a virtual orphan following his father\u2019s death in occupied France in 1944. He was bequeathed little money but was occasionally asked to stay at Windsor Castle while on leave, where he watched Elizabeth act, tap-dance and sing in a family pantomime. The princess might have been besotted, but the courtiers were not, and the footmen noted gleefully when they unpacked his weekend valise that it contained no spare shoes \u2013 his only pair was holed \u2013 pyjamas or slippers.", "He was thought to be no gentleman and, in immediate postwar days, to be little better than a German: the diplomat Harold Nicolson wrote of him that he was \u201crough, ill-mannered, uneducated and \u2026 probably not faithful\u201d.", "The impoverished young serviceman\u2019s name was not in the first XI of the Queen\u2019s list of acceptable suitors, but by 1946 he was being invited to Balmoral, where he became engaged to Elizabeth. \u201cIt was sort of fixed up,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, if you spend 10 minutes thinking about it \u2013 and a lot of these people spent a great deal more time thinking about it \u2013 how many obviously eligible young men, other than people living in this country, were available?\u201d", "The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Elizabeth at Broadlands, Hampshire, during their honeymoon, November 1947. Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images", "The engagement had to be kept secret, but leaked. The palace denied it. In a newspaper poll, 40% disapproved of him because of his foreign background and Germanic relatives. Philip acquired British citizenship, rejecting the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg surname in favour of Mountbatten. In July 1947, the engagement was finally announced. The couple married the following November in the first big public spectacle during postwar austerity. The clothing ration had to be relaxed to provide a wedding dress. Elizabeth took her corgi Susan on the honeymoon. Philip caught a cold.", "King George wrote to Elizabeth: \u201cI can see you are sublimely happy with Philip, which is right, but don\u2019t forget us.\u201d Honours unprecedented in his family were showered on him: a seat in the Lords, \u00a310,000 a year \u2013 a handsome sum in those days \u2013 from public funds, the freedom of London, the dukedom and freedom of Edinburgh and a desk job at the Admiralty. Prince Charles was born a year after the wedding, Princess Anne in 1950. In 1949, Philip went to sea again, based in Malta, where Elizabeth joined him \u2013 perhaps the only time in their marriage when they could lead relatively normal lives as a young service couple. It was anyway a period that they remembered as so idyllic that they returned to the island in 2007 after their 60th wedding anniversary.", "They had expected their semi-private life to last for a good 20 years. But George VI fell ill in 1949, and in February 1952 died of lung cancer at the age of 56. Philip and Elizabeth were on tour in Kenya, at the start of a lengthy overseas visit, when he broke the news to his young wife. \u201cHe looked as if you\u2019d dropped half the world on him,\u201d said his equerry, Mike Parker. There was some truth in this. Just when he and his wife had embarked on their young family-forming years, Philip, at 30, found himself consort to the Queen, head of an empire rapidly becoming the Commonwealth but still monarch of 16 countries.", "The Queen and Prince Philip taking tea during a state visit to Japan in 1975. Photograph: Reginald Davis/Rex Features", "His diminished status as the sovereign\u2019s consort, pledging his allegiance to his wife at her coronation as her \u201cliege man of life and limb and earthly worship\u201d, without a career of his own, was irksome at first. He rationalised and sublimated the boredom as his duty \u2013 something well recognisable to men of his generation \u2013 primarily to his wife and then to the institution and the country. He always turned up at the right place and time, well-prepared and on top of his brief. At meetings of the organisations with which he was associated, he could be relied on to ask well-informed questions and not allow platitudes or sloppy thinking to prevail. The Queen remained devoted to him, calling him \u201cmy strength and my stay\u201d.", "In the early years, he found a refuge and substitute for the naval wardroom in the Thursday Club, an all-male drinking and dining den dedicated to badinage and practical jokes. It met above a Soho restaurant. Members included the Conservative politician Iain Macleod, the film star David Niven, the mouth-organist Larry Adler and the osteopath Stephen Ward, who became a pivotal figure in the 1963 Profumo scandal.", "The Ward link inspired a famous Private Eye cartoon cover showing Philip\u2019s coronation robe cast off in the bedroom of Ward\u2019s friend, Christine Keeler. No evidence emerged to support such gossip, although Parker\u2019s estranged wife claimed in a book in 1982 that Philip and Parker habitually slipped out of Buckingham Palace to carouse together under the noms de guerre Murgatroyd and Winterbotham.", "The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the closing ceremony of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. Photograph: Fairfax Media/Fairfax Media via Getty Images", "Yet the struggle to define a role was earnest and honest. \u201cI do not have a job,\u201d Philip wrote to his 1991 biographer, Tim Heald. \u201cI never set about planning my career. I had two general ideas. I felt that I could use my position to attract attention to certain aspects of life in this country, and that this might help to recognise the good things and expose the bad things. I also believed I might be able to start various initiatives. You might ask whether all this rushing about (on public duties) is to any purpose. Am I just doing it to look as if I\u2019m earning my keep or has it any national value?\u201d", "Although he was energetic, industrious and by far the best public speaker in the family, virtually no public discussion took place on how he could be useful. His wife was shy and constitutionally obliged to be non-partisan, which set limits on his public role if he was not to appear a publicity-hog or usurper. Early on, he was dogged by Lord Beaverbrook\u2019s paranoid press campaign over his and his uncle\u2019s German connections, a feud that was resolved between Mountbatten and Beaverbrook\u2019s heir Sir Max Aitken in the 1970s. The equally mass-selling Mirror press under Hugh Cudlipp ran self-consciously \u201ccheeky-chappie\u201d protest editorials whenever he bumped into controversy.", "Later, the press would construct a highly partial picture of an insensitive and pugnacious figure, which took no account of his more genial and empathetic private relations. This reached its apogee in accusations after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales that he had harried and bullied her as her marriage broke down, whereas it became clear, as his letters to her were divulged during her belated inquest, that he had been concerned and understanding of her plight.", "The Duke of Edinburgh, left, with Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, 1997.

Early in the 1950s, he told the Society of Motor Manufacturers that thanks to traffic congestion, \u201cit will soon be quicker to go on foot\u201d. In 1960, he advocated \u201cforgiving one\u2019s enemies\u201d to the Anglo-German Association. He denounced \u201ccrude, industrial philosophies in agriculture\u201d that would do immense social and demographic damage.", "In the early 70s, he said Britain was living beyond its means: \u201cAnyone who believes North Sea oil alone is going to get us out of trouble would also believe that social security is available at a pawnbroker\u2019s shop.\u201d In 1977, the year of his wife\u2019s silver jubilee, he compared the British economy to dry rot in a house: \u201cYou don\u2019t know when it starts, you don\u2019t know when the crisis is, but gradually the place becomes uninhabitable.\u201d", "But, in the absence of intelligent public debate, it grew too easy for those he attacked to dismiss him as a loose cannon. On a visit to Canada, the frustration boiled into his angriest, though still controlled, public remark: \u201cIt is a complete misconception to imagine that the monarchy exists in the interests of the monarchy. It does not. It exists in the interests of the people, in the sense that we do not come here for the benefit of our health, so to speak. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves. Judging by some of the programme we are required to do \u2013 and how little we get out of it \u2013 you can assume that it is done in the interests of the Canadian people and not our own interest.\u201d", "The Duke of Edinburgh and members of the royal family watch a fly-past from the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping of the Colour in 2012.

If it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "By the time of his 90th birthday, Philip acknowledged the need to step down from some of his public commitments: \u201cIt\u2019s better to get out before you reach the sell-by date.\u201d Reviewing the course of his life in television interviews held no fascination for him. As he explained to Fiona Bruce of the BBC, when he had first asked what he was to do, no one could tell him so he proceeded by trial and error. Six decades later, having been involved with more than 800 organisations, he still had a quite uncluttered view of the uses and limitations of being a figurehead. Barely concealing his impatience with Bruce\u2019s questions and making little effort to charm, he did admit to a desire to slow down: \u201cI reckon I\u2019ve done my bit. I want to enjoy myself now with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say \u2026 The memory\u2019s going \u2026 Yes, I am just sort of winding down.\u201d", "Yet he scarcely did so. In 2011, he accompanied his wife on a potentially difficult state visit to Ireland and on an arduous tour of Australia. Although beginning to look more frail and slightly stooping, he remained ever-present and seemingly indestructible at the Queen\u2019s side until the Christmas weekend, when he was rushed to hospital with chest pains for an emergency heart operation \u2013 the first significant, publicly acknowledged, illness of his life. A stent was inserted into his coronary artery and he was kept in for four days. Reports suggested he was chafing at the experience and, on his release, he headed straight for the shooting party at Sandringham.", "The day after standing with the Queen for four hours in pelting rain onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames pageant to mark her diamond jubilee in June 2012, he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection. The Queen had to attend a concert at Buckingham Palace and a service of thanksgiving at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral on her own and cast a somewhat forlorn figure. When asked if he was feeling better as he left King Edward VII\u2019s hospital five days later, he replied: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t be coming out if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d", "The Duke of Edinburgh, second from left, with members of the royal family during the diamond jubilee pageant on the River Thames, June 2012.

His wedding anniversary that year marked seven decades at his wife\u2019s side.", "Beyond his public service and personal relationships, there was one organisation in which Philip had some clout as an executive \u2013 the monarchy itself. Among his first acts as consort was to free palace servants of the 18th-century obligation to powder their hair with flour and starch on state occasions, a \u201cridiculous and unmanly\u201d rule, he called it. He part-modernised the economies of the royal estates, got rid of debutantes at court, was the first royal to master television and the first modern one to write books and articles. He insisted that his children, unlike their royal predecessors, went to school, and backed Prince Charles\u2019s eagerness to go to university.", "At the end of it all, as Prince Albert wrote: \u201cThe position of a prince consort requires that a husband should entirely sink his own individual interests in that of his wife.\u201d Philip, with a less assertive wife than Victoria but also a weak constitutional position, maintained a stubborn profile. And he ended by printing his own name as well as his own bloodline on some of the generations after him: Mountbatten-Windsor.
