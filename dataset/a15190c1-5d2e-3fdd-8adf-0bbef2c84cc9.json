This is a proxy war, like the old Soviet Union using Cubans to fight in Africa. The media that lobbied for the impeachment of Trump ever since he was elected finally got Democrats to do their bidding and try once more to take down the president.", "But journalists couldn\u2019t bring themselves to celebrate. Instead, they freaked out because a Republican senator was curt to a CNN reporter.", "TRUMP LAWYERS RESPOND TO ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT: 'CONSTITUTIONALLY INVALID'", "The reason the thin-skinned press was more thin-skinned than usual was that the impeachment trial in the Senate that moves into high gear this week has about the same chance of removing Trump from office as the Cincinnati Bengals do of winning Super Bowl LIV. And the Bengals aren\u2019t even in the playoffs.", "So it was no wonder that journalists were angry when Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., called CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju a \u201cliberal hack.\u201d Twice. The news media responded in hilariously histrionic ways. Washington Post Media Critic Erik Wemple called the comment \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cchilling.\u201d", "CNN was especially offended, pounding the story hour after hour like McSally had assaulted Raju in the hallway. Anchors practically lined up to take on McSally. Wolf Blitzer referred to her comment as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cawful.\u201d Anderson Cooper called the comment a \u201cslur\u201d and Jake Tapper said it was \u201cobviously indecent.\u201d", "Chris Cuomo was determined to outdo them all. The foam-at-the-mouth anti-Trumper practically turned part of his show into an anti-McSally/anti-Trump commercial. He readily honored McSally\u2019s military service, but then emphasized how she wasn\u2019t similar to the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who was also a veteran.", "Cuomo told viewers that McSally \u201cbears no resemblance to McCain\u2019s dignity, decency, discretion.\u201d Then he amped up the attack even more, declaring: \u201cI can\u2019t believe people would vote for her to fill McCain\u2019s seat.\u201d", "Lost in the uproar was any attempt to discuss facts.", "First, Raju\u2019s employer is a major party to the three-year phony Russian collusion claim. Then Raju has his own history. He falsely reported that WikiLeaks had emailed Team Trump on September 4, 2016, with a way to access embarrassing documents. It turned out the email was dated 10 days later and Raju had to go on air and admit his error. He received no discipline.", "All of that was swept under the rug and many in the press embraced the \u201cliberal hack\u201d label themselves. CNN Chief Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin had already given his ruling on the case. \u201cThe other thing to remember about witnesses is all the witnesses will show that the president is guilty because he is guilty.\u201d", "CNN was especially thrilled by the Democrats' choices for impeachment managers, noting that many were people of color. And anchor Jim Sciutto was excited to show that Democrats had made their picks from many different states. He told co-anchor Poppy Harlow, \"you made the point territorial, geographic diversity as well.\u201d", "Mapmaker, mapmaker, make me a map!", "The media oohed and ahhed about the seriousness of the impeachment. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow scored ratings gold with a last-minute hit-job interview. Chris Matthews called the impeachment \u201csacramental.\u201d", "Fellow MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell claimed to \u201cThe Al Franken Podcast\u201d that CNN isn\u2019t Never-Trump territory after all. \u201cOne-third of the people on their payroll love Trump,\u201d he argued, pretending that \u201cone-third of the programming will be supportive of Trump.\u201d (He doesn\u2019t actually watch CNN, apparently.)", "O\u2019Donnell vowed MSNBC would be worse than CNN about Trump, saying \u201con MSNBC there will be no one defending him because we don\u2019t bring on liars. I don\u2019t bring on a liar. I won\u2019t do that.\u201d", "The MSNBC gang was after Trump, his family and his supporters. \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski joined comedian Stephen Colbert on the CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d Monday to bash Trump.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "Scarborough ranted, asking: \u201cWhen is Donald Trump going to pay for this? When is Donald Trump going to pay for all the lies? When is he going to pay for the recklessness?\u201d He and Brzezinski were hopeful for a Democratic landslide in the November elections.", "Scarborough went further on his own show just a few days later, cautioning that \u201ceveryone who defends Donald Trump right now will be exposed.\u201d Scarborough listed Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General William Barr and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, warning about the \u201cbleak\u201d tide of history.", "\u201cAnd their families, their children, their grandchildren \u2013 everyone who has their last name \u2013 will carry that around with them,\u201d Scarborough said.", "The media made the impeachment fiasco sound so ominous.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "\u201cRubin Report\u201d Host Dave Rubin mocked the inside-the-Beltway mentality on impeachment, writing: \u201cIs there anyone outside of the media bubble who cares about impeachment?
