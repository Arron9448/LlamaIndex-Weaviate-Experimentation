Zach Epley has accused the mayor of surveilling him from a car as he went door-to-door campaigning, which Mr. Warren denies.", "Image Zach Epley, who ran unsuccessfully for a seat on Southampton\u2019s board of trustees, is the son of the former mayor.

Since 2017, members of the Epley family have owned the house next door. The purchase of the building where Mr. Warren lives was not part of a grand plot to oust a rival, but was what Mark Epley described as \u201cestate planning\u201d \u2014 a row of future homes for his 11 grandchildren, the oldest of whom is in elementary school.", "As his lease came to a close in the fall, the Epleys said they initially offered Mr. Warren a yearlong extension. But when Mr. Warren demanded via his lawyer that it include a stipulation that the landlords never set foot on the property, among other requests, the Epleys rescinded the offer, the younger Mr. Epley said. The mayor did not deny making those requests.", "In The Southampton Press, Zach Epley offered a different rationale for asking Mr. Warren to leave: \u201cIt\u2019s about how nasty he was during the election and how he harassed our family,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going door to door with my family, and he was following my family around with a video camera and walking into houses after me and trashing us out. Why are we going to keep somebody on a property that was so awful to us?\u201d"], "authors": ["Sarah Maslin Nir"], "keywords": ["complicated", "exclusive", "mr", "family", "trustees", "enclave", "zach", "epleys", "hamptons", "squatter", "mayor", "door", "unsuccessfully", "epley", "warren"], "pubDate": "2021-02-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
