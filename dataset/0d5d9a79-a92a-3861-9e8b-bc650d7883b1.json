The holidays are a time to send love to those closest to you, get cozy on a cold winter's day, and find the craziest Christmas-themed Steam games to play with your friends.", "One of our favorite traditions at Game Informer is putting together the holiday episode of Replay, and this year didn't disappoint. Join Andrew Reiner, Dan Tack, Joe Juba, and me as we pick some truly bonkers Christmas games and celebrate the holiday the only way we know how.", "First up is Christmas Adventures: A Winter Night's Dream, a hidden objects game that not only tests our eye but our patience as well. After that, we boot up Cold Call, a horror game that tasks us with solving the supernatural disappearance of a family on Christmas eve. Next up is The Santa Paradox which...actually, I've already played the game, and I'm still not sure what it was about. There were pumpkins and a kid wanting to be a wizard. Anyway, we round out the show with one last game that I won't spoil for you, but I can promise it's one of my favorite titles we've played during my time on Replay.", "Thank you so much to everyone who watched the show this year. We're taking a bit of a break for the holidays but rest assured there's more Replay coming your way. We'll have one more prerecorded episode for you locked and loaded for 2 p.m. CT next week, and we'll be back to our live shows in 2021!
