Putin of Russia on Wednesday delivered an annual address replete with threats against the West but, despite intense tensions with Ukraine, stopped short of announcing new military or foreign policy moves. Russia\u2019s response will be \u201casymmetric, fast and tough\u201d if it is forced to defend its interests, Mr. Putin said, pointing to what he claimed were Western efforts at regime change in neighboring Belarus as another threat to Russia\u2019s security. He pledged that Russia \u201cwants to have good relations with all participants of international society,\u201d even as he noted that Russia\u2019s modernized nuclear weapons systems were at the ready. \u201cThe organizers of any provocations threatening the fundamental interests of our security will regret their deeds more than they have regretted anything in a long time,\u201d Mr. Putin told a hall of governors and members of Parliament. \u201cI hope no one gets the idea to cross the so-called red line with Russia \u2014 and we will be the ones to decide where it runs in every concrete case.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s speech had been widely anticipated, with about 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine\u2019s border and Ukraine\u2019s president warning openly of the possibility of war. Some analysts had speculated that Mr. Putin might use his annual state of the nation address to announce a pretext for sending troops into Ukraine. But that possible outcome did not come to pass, even as Russia\u2019s enormous military presence near Ukraine\u2019s borders showed no sign of receding. Mr. Putin also made no reference to the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, whose supporters were holding protests across the country on Wednesday. Instead, Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on domestic issues, acknowledging Russians\u2019 discontent with the hardships of the pandemic. He outlined programs to subsidize summer camp for children, smooth the system for child-support payments to single mothers and move more social services online. Still, it was too early to tell whether Mr. Putin, 68, was pulling back from the brink. Now in his third decade in power, he appears more convinced than ever of his special, historic role as the father of a reborn Russian nation, fighting at home and abroad against a craven, hypocritical, morally decaying West. \u201cThis sense of superiority mixed with arrogance gives him a feeling of power, and this is dangerous,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian analyst who has studied Mr. Putin for years. \u201cWhen you think you are more powerful and more wise than everyone else around you, you think you have a certain historical mandate for more wide-ranging action.\u201d Mr. Putin has made moves in recent weeks that, even by his standards, signal an escalation in his conflict with those he perceives as enemies, foreign and domestic. Russian prosecutors last week filed suit to outlaw Mr. Navalny\u2019s organization, a step that could result in the most intense wave of political repression in post-Soviet Russia. And in Russia\u2019s southwest, Mr. Putin has built up a military force, the Kremlin has indicated, that could be prepared to move into neighboring Ukraine.", "Ukraine\u2019s president warns that war may be coming, and vows that his nation will stand \u2018to the last man.\u2019 President Volodymyr Zelensky, center, on the front line in Ukraine\u2019s Mariupol region this month. Credit... Ukrainian Presidential Press Service, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressed his nation on Tuesday evening, warning citizens of the possibility of war. He addressed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directly, urging him to step back from the brink and proposing that the two meet. The unusual videotaped appearance by Mr. Zelensky \u2014 a former comedian elected in 2019 on a promise to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine \u2014 was the clearest signal yet that Ukraine is girding for the possibility of a full-fledged war with Russia. Moscow\u2019s buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border, he said, had created \u201call the preconditions for escalation.\u201d \u201cDoes Ukraine want war? No. Is it ready for it? Yes,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cOur principle is simple: Ukraine does not start a war first, but Ukraine always stands to the last man.\u201d It appeared to be no coincidence that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s address came on the eve of Mr. Putin\u2019s annual state of the nation address on Wednesday. At the end of his video, Mr. Zelensky switched from Ukrainian to Russian, speaking to Mr. Putin directly. He pushed back at Mr. Putin\u2019s contention that Russian forces would be used in Ukraine only if the Russian-speaking population in the east was threatened, and proposed a summit in the war-torn eastern region known as Donbas. \u201cIt is impossible to bring peace on a tank,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cI am ready,\u201d he continued, \u201cto invite you to meet anywhere in the Ukrainian Donbas where there is war.\u201d There was no immediate response from the Kremlin to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s invitation.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "In Pictures: Government-controlled Ukraine near the front line.

Navalny, a step that could result in the most intense wave of political repression in the post-Soviet era. But supporters of the jailed opposition leader say they are determined to take to the streets. Opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin have called for protests across Russia on Wednesday in support of Mr. Navalny, whose allies say he is on a hunger strike and near death in a Russian prison. The police were expected to intervene forcefully to break up the protests, which started in the country\u2019s Far East even before Mr. Putin had finished delivering his state of the nation speech. Mr. Putin has rarely mentioned Mr. Navalny by name and did not do so in his speech. He did not refer to him in any way. Mr. Navalny is insisting that he be allowed to be seen by doctors of his choosing. A lawyer who visited him, Vadim Kobzev, said on Tuesday that Mr. Navalny\u2019s arms were punctured and bruised after three nurses had unsuccessfully tried six times to hook him up to an intravenous drip. \u201cIf you saw me now, you would laugh,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in a letter that his team posted to social media. \u201cA skeleton walking, swaying, in its cell.\u201d The Kremlin depicts Mr. Navalny as an agent of American influence, and Russian prosecutors filed a lawsuit on Friday to declare his organization \u201cextremist\u201d and illegal. The extremism designation, which a Moscow court will consider in a secret trial starting next week, would effectively force Russia\u2019s most potent opposition movement underground and could result in yearslong prison terms for pro-Navalny activists. The White House has warned the Russian government that it \u201cwill be held accountable\u201d if Mr. Navalny dies in prison. Western officials \u2014 and Mr. Navalny\u2019s supporters and allies \u2014 reject the idea that he is acting on another country\u2019s behalf. But in the Kremlin\u2019s logic, Mr. Navalny is a threat to Russian statehood, doing the West\u2019s bidding by undermining Mr. Putin. It is Mr. Putin who is keeping Russia stable by maintaining a balance between competing factions in Russia\u2019s ruling elite, said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cIf Putin leaves, a battle between different groups breaks out, and Russia withdraws into itself, has no time for the rest of the world and no longer gets in anyone\u2019s way,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. \u201cThe West is, of course, using Navalny, and will use him to create problems for Putin and, in the longer term, help Putin become history in one way or another.\u201d", "As protests begin in Russia\u2019s Far East, the authorities detain activists.

Tatyana Makeyeva/Reuters MOSCOW \u2014 Protesters in Vladivostok, a major port on the eastern tip of Russia, had no need to hear President Vladimir V.

They knew what they see as the main issues facing the country would not get mentioned. \u201cFreedom to political prisoners,\u201d they chanted as they marched through the city center, according to videos posted on social media. \u201cFreedom to Navalny!\u201d they screamed, referring to Aleksei A.

Mr. Putin was still speaking when people started gathering on main squares in the country\u2019s Far East \u2014 where protests started before rallies were expected to sweep across the vast nation of 11 time zones. By the time Mr. Putin had finished, eight people were already detained in the remote city of Magadan, according to Vesma, a local news website. About 40 people came out to protest in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the capital of the Kamchatka region, with no arrests reported. In Irkutsk, a major city further east toward Moscow, hundreds of people marched through the city chanting \u201cFreedom to Navalny!\u201d and \u201cIrkutsk, come out!\u201d The police in Irkutsk detained 11 people.

Since Mr. Navalny\u2019s return, the Russian government has undertaken an aggressive crackdown on dissent, raising the risks for anyone sympathetic to the protest movement. Dozens of opposition activists were arrested in 20 cities across Russia ahead of the Wednesday rallies. Some of the activists were beaten and sentenced to administrative arrests, according to OVD Info. Many were members of Mr. Navalny\u2019s political organization, but some were arrested simply for having shared social media posts about the rallies. Among those detained were two prominent associates of Mr. Navalny: his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh; and Lyubov Sobol. In recent weeks, the Russian authorities have conducted raids on Mr. Navalny\u2019s offices across the country, looking for leaflets and other materials calling for protests. Those items would presumably be used in the Kremlin\u2019s drive to have his organization labeled \u201cextremist,\u201d which would expose its members to potentially lengthy prison terms. In Kurgan, a city in central Russia, an unidentified person sneaked into Mr. Navalny\u2019s office on Monday morning and destroyed a radiator, flooding the premises. Under various pretexts, the authorities in cities across Russia blocked central squares and streets. In Yekaterinburg, they rescheduled a Victory Day parade rehearsal to ensure that it overlapped with a scheduled protest. In Kostroma, the central square was closed down, ostensibly for pest control measures. In universities across the country, students were ordered to sit for unscheduled tests and other gatherings with mandatory attendance, TV Rain, an independent news station reported on Tuesday. The authorities in Moscow denied Mr. Navalny\u2019s allies a permit for the rally they have planned for Wednesday evening, citing coronavirus concerns. The Prosecutor General\u2019s office warned parents that they would be subject to fines and arrest if their underage children are detained at a rally. More than 450,000 people nationwide registered online to declare their intent to take part in demonstrations against Mr. Navalny\u2019s incarceration and treatment in prison. More than 100,000 people did so in Moscow, and more than 50,000 in St. Petersburg.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Putin alleges a C.I.A. assassination plot in Belarus. President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus in Sochi, Russia, in February. Credit... Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images In a speech filled with bluster and bromides against the West, President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday lingered on a grievance that has not gained much traction outside the Russian state news media: an unfounded accusation that the C.I.A. has been plotting to assassinate the leader of Belarus. Even as he raised the subject, Mr. Putin acknowledged that it was not being taken seriously outside Russia. \u201cCharacteristically, even such lamentable actions are not discussed in the so-called collective West,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cThey pretend nothing happened.\u201d Over the weekend, Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, arrested two men who it said were plotting to murder President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus and to seize television and radio stations. It said the men had coordinated with U.S. and Polish intelligence agencies and come to Russia to meet Belarusian generals sympathetic to the opposition. The Russian authorities released video that showed the men casually discussing their improbable plot over a meal at a Moscow restaurant. One of the men, Aleksandr Feduta, is a former spokesman for Mr. Lukashenko. The other, Yuras Zyankovich, has dual U.S. and Belarusian citizenship. The United States and Polish governments denied any role in a murder and coup plot in Belarus. The arrests aligned with Mr. Putin\u2019s casting of Russia in his state of the nation speech on Wednesday as victimized and pressured by a hypocritical and aggressive Western world that poses imminent threats. The encroaching West, Mr. Putin said, has \u201ccrossed all the boundaries.\u201d Policies to pressure Russia that were previously limited to economic sanctions \u201chave been reborn as something more dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI have in mind the recent facts that came to light of a direct attempt to organize a coup in Belarus and the murder of the leader of that country.\u201d", "Friction between the U.S. and Russia deepens. In an interview in March, President Biden assented when asked whether Vladimir V. Putin was a \u201ckiller.\u201d Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times The election of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as president of the United States, despite his promise to be tough on Russia, initially gave the Kremlin hope, analysts say. He was seen as more professional, reliable and pragmatic than President Donald J. Trump, with a worldview shaped by a Cold War era of diplomacy in which Washington and Moscow engaged as equal superpowers with a responsibility for global security. In their first phone call in January, Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin agreed to extend the New Start arms-control treaty, a Russian foreign policy goal that the Kremlin had not been able to achieve with Mr. Trump. Then came the television interview in March in which Mr. Biden assented when asked whether Mr. Putin was a \u201ckiller.\u201d A month later, that moment \u2014 to which Russian officials and commentators responded with a squall of prime-time-televised, anti-American fury \u2014 looks like a turning point. It was followed by last week\u2019s raft of American sanctions against Russia, combined with Mr. Biden\u2019s call for a summit meeting with Mr. Putin, which to many Russians looked like a crude American attempt to negotiate from a position of strength. \u201cThis is seen as an unacceptable situation \u2014 you won\u2019t chase us into the stall with sanctions,\u201d said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. How far Mr. Putin will go in striking back against the West\u2019s real or imagined hostility is an open question. In the state news media, the mood music is dire. On the flagship weekly news show on the Rossiya 1 channel on Sunday, the host Dmitri Kiselyov closed a segment on Mr. Putin\u2019s showdown with Mr. Biden by reminding viewers of Poseidon \u2014 a weapon in Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal that Mr. Putin revealed three years ago. \u201cRussia\u2019s armed forces are ready to test-fire a nuclear torpedo that would cause radioactive tsunamis capable of flooding enemy cities and making them uninhabitable for decades,\u201d a translation of a Danish newspaper report intoned. Still, there are signs that Mr. Putin does not want tensions with the West to spiral out of control. As Europe and the United States scrambled to assess the Russian troop buildup in late March, Russia\u2019s top military officer, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, spoke on the phone with his American counterpart, Gen. Mark A. Milley. On Monday, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Mr. Putin\u2019s Security Council, discussed the prospect of a presidential summit with Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser. And the Kremlin said this week that Mr. Putin would speak at Mr. Biden\u2019s online climate change meeting on Thursday. Ms. Stanovaya, the analyst, says she was convinced that Mr. Putin is more interested than his hawkish advisers in looking for ways to work with the United States. She pointed to Mr. Putin\u2019s determination to return Russia to the ranks of great powers. \u201cPutin very much believes in his mission as a great historic figure with responsibility not only for Russia, but also for global security,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand how it is that the American president doesn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d", "Russia closes the airspace near the Ukraine border. A satellite image of Russian military equipment at the Opuk training area on Crimea\u2019s Black Sea coast. Credit... Maxar Technologies, via Associated Press The Russian authorities closed airspace to commercial traffic near the Ukrainian border starting on Tuesday in another sign of rising military tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The warning to commercial pilots covers parts of the Crimean Peninsula \u2014 annexed by Russia seven years ago \u2014 and international airspace over the Black Sea. It formalized what had already become obvious: The region is in the grips of an increasingly ominous military crisis. Ukraine objected last week to Russia\u2019s closing of areas in the Black Sea to shipping, a ban that the U.S. State Department spokesman, Ned Price, on Monday called an \u201cunprovoked escalation in Moscow\u2019s ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine.\u201d Over the past month, Russia has massed the largest military force along Ukraine\u2019s eastern border and in Crimea since the outset of war in 2014, according to Western governments. Analysts say that the deliberately high visibility of the buildup indicates that its purpose is more a warning to the West than a prelude to invasion. \u201cThey are deploying in a very visible way,\u201d said Michael Kofman, a senior researcher at CNA, a policy research group in Arlington, Va. \u201cThey are doing it overtly, so we can see it. It is intentional.\u201d The Russian military says it is conducting exercises in response to Ukrainian threats to two Russian-backed separatist regions and to what it calls heightened NATO military activity in the Black Sea area. Military tensions have also risen elsewhere. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s Air Force flew two nuclear-capable Tu-160 strategic bombers over the Baltic Sea for eight hours. In the Arctic Ocean, the Northern Fleet has been conducting a huge naval drill, the Defense Ministry said.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story"], "authors": ["Anton Troianovski"], "keywords": ["times", "warns", "line", "russias", "ukraine", "updates", "addressing", "putin", "russian", "military", "mr", "west", "president", "cross", "navalny", "live", "russia", "red"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
