While some wedding traditions have been gleefully thrown into the dustbin of history\u2014I mean, who can even imagine promising to \u201cobey\u201d in their vows anymore?\u2014the desire for the very best engagement ring endures.", "Whether your ceremony is a barefoot beach affair or a blowout in a hotel ballroom, the best engagement ring you have ever imagined will shine from the best manicured finger you\u2019ve ever flaunted on what is meant to be the best day of your life. (Okay, let\u2019s say one of the five best days of your life\u2014since surely the birth of a child, or an amazing job promotion, counts too?)", "What makes an engagement ring best? It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s the one that reflects your own distinct personality, that speaks directly to your soul\u2014the one you\u2019ve always dreamed of (maybe as much as you\u2019ve dreamed up a dreamy partner.) It could be a classic version, with a gorgeous big stone plopped upon a platinum band; it could be a slightly quirkier iteration of an emerald, princess, marquis, or cushion cut! It could be a diamond-studded band doing double duty as engagement-ring-and-wedding-band-in-one; or it could be something totally wild, totally nutty, that speaks to the two of you in a language only you two understand.", "If, right about now, you are feeling overwhelmed by this vast plethora of choices, in every price point, in every metal, there is an enormous variety of good, better, and best engagement rings out there. Would it help if you knew a little history of the best engagement rings?", "It all began, at least allegedly, in 1477, when Archduke Maximilian of Austria commissioned the very first diamond engagement ring for his intended, Mary of Burgundy. Members of the European nobility soon copied his idea. Still, the notion of a diamond engagement ring was far out of reach for most people, at least until the Victorian era, when a burgeoning middle class had the buying power for such trifles. (If you couldn\u2019t afford a real diamond, you could have one of paste!)", "Of course, the most revered engagement rings in history were made of the finest materials. Napoleon gave Josephine a ring meant to evoke two teardrops in sapphire and diamond to symbolize their two hearts; Queen Victoria opted for a snake ring, an unconventional choice even if it was accented with a large emerald, rubies, and diamonds. Audrey Hepburn brandished a trio of studded bands; Jackie Kennedy rocked an emerald. And Lady Diana Spencer\u2019s famous engagement ring consisted of 14 diamonds surrounding that incredible 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire, set in 18-karat white gold. (Kate Middleton has it now.)", "If we learn anything from these lessons in jewelry lore, it is this\u2014there is no one \u201cbest engagement ring.\u201d Whether you opt for a classic diamond, a traditional version with a twist, a vintage-inspired design, a dramatic all-in-one band, or something unexpected and truly wild, your ring will be as glorious, and, we hope, as long-lived as the relationship it celebrates.", "Classic Rings", "These beautiful styles have stood the test of time.", "Charlotte Chesnais Fine Jewelry Elipse solitaire diamond and 18-karat gold ring $3,583 MATCHESFASHION.COM Shop Now Platt Boutique Jewelry Heirloom prong-set diamond engagement ring $3,290 BLUE NILE Shop Now", "Van Cleef & Arpels Perl\u00e9e solitaire 0.30-carat diamond and rose gold ring $3,650 VAN CLEEF & ARPELS Shop Now Shay diamond and 18-karat white-gold ring $44,000 MATCHESFASHION.COM Shop Now", "Tiffany & Co.
