Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and \"art for art's sake.\"", "Newspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his \"purple hours\" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\"", "The fight for visibility", "The 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a \"dash\" or \"streak\" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln's biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president's early male friendships as containing a \"streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets.\"", "During the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed \"The Lavender Scare\" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality.", "A group of women, one dressed as Greek poet Sappho, gather on the National Mall before the Equal Rights Amendment March.

Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a \"gay power\" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before.", "It was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a \"Lavender Menace.\" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words \"Lavender Menace\" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism.", "Lavender, however, can't always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest.", "Throughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender \"napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake.\"", "English writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp at New York's Gay Pride parade in June 1982.
