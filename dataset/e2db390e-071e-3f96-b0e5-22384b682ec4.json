There are times when men\u2019s fashion is more energetic than women\u2019s, and other times on the contrary. There was a movement called Mori-girl in Japan, which was based on the concept of a girl who looks like she is living in the forest, and there were times when normcore was a trend on the other hand,\u201d Shito says. \u201cSometimes the whole industry is very vigorous and there are times when it\u2019s not.
