I\u2019m this queer dyke who has done shit in her life\u2014and that is my identity?\u201d In a funny, curmudgeonly monologue, Abby describes herself as an unfinished building ruining a good neighborhood\u2014\u201can eyesore.\u201d When she glances up, her shrink, still grinning supportively, has dropped dead.", "It\u2019s a Borscht Belt gag, but, then, Abby\u2019s whole life feels like a punch line. Still, buried in that Eeyore-ish lament, there\u2019s something else: Abby\u2019s girlish fantasy of herself as a \u201cfucking damsel\u201d longing for rescue\u2014by a prince or a princess, the details don\u2019t matter. Magically, that\u2019s just what she gets when she meets Chris, a twenty-two-year-old waiter who Abby (Abby McEnany) initially assumes is hitting on her straight sister. Played by the supremely chill Theo Germaine, Chris looks like Abby\u2019s prince in shining tank tops, capable of fixing the unfixable.", "This budding romance isn\u2019t precisely a Nora Ephron meet-cute, but it\u2019s a charmer in a new way. Abby is unfazed by the news that Chris is trans, and, despite the generational gulf, there\u2019s symmetry to their gender issues: to strangers, Chris, who can\u2019t afford \u201ctop surgery,\u201d reads as a cute lesbian tomboy, while Abby, with her shlumpy butch charisma, short-cropped gray hair, and button-down shirts, has spent her life being mistaken for male, even in lesbian bars. In college, she was taunted as \u201cPat,\u201d after the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d character, and when, on their first date, she and Chris run into the comedian who played Pat, Julia Sweeney (an executive producer for the show, gamely playing herself), Chris urges Abby to tell her off. \u201cI really love conflict,\u201d he explains, smiling sweetly. Because he\u2019s twenty-two, Chris is stunned to hear of the existence of Pat\u2014what\u2019s so funny about a person whose gender can\u2019t be guessed?", "\u201cWork in Progress,\u201d like its heroine, is sweetly imperfect: not every bit lands, and Chris can feel, at moments, too good to be true. But the series explores, with warmth and originality, the messy gulf between the era when Abby came out\u2014as an overall-wearing romantic in a frat-boy world, drinking in lesbian bars full of folksingers\u2014and Chris\u2019s community of cheerful poly hipsters in Spock ears, corsets, and throuples. When Chris takes Abby to a night club, which features bare-assed burlesque and signs for fisting demonstrations, she groans, \u201cI look like Mitt Romney, Jr.\u201d \u201cJunior?\u201d Chris shoots back. In another episode, in a cab, the couple text their sexual preferences back and forth, turning informed consent into flirtation. \u201cPENETRATION,\u201d Chris texts. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can fit my Thoughts into one text,\u201d Abby texts back, throwing off panicked GIFs of Mr. Furley, from \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d", "In many ways, \u201cWork in Progress\u201d is a familiar entry in an established genre: it\u2019s an indie comedy by and about a clever, dyspeptic misfit looking for love. Like Pamela Adlon\u2019s \u201cBetter Things\u201d and Tig Notaro\u2019s \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d it\u2019s about a single misanthrope cautiously dipping her toe into the dating pool. Like Josh Thomas\u2019s \u201cPlease Like Me\u201d and Maria Bamford\u2019s \u201cLady Dynamite,\u201d it\u2019s interested in mental illness and self-help. But \u201cWork in Progress\u201d\u2014which is co-written and produced by Lilly Wachowski\u2014is smartly edited, full of odd little montages and visual juxtapositions. It has its own distinctive, salty vibe, driven by McEnany\u2019s simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandizing swagger. She\u2019s an irritant with charm, along with genuine baggage. (Among other things, she has O.C.D.; as annoyed people bang on the bathroom door, she washes her hands raw.) She also has a secret closet full of notebooks in which she\u2019s recorded her whole life. Nobody knows it, but Abby is telling their story. In certain ways, \u201cWork in Progress\u201d is a mirror image of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s \u201cNanette,\u201d which argues that self-deprecation, especially for people like her and Abby, amounts to self-harm. \u201cWork in Progress\u201d takes the position that it might be something better: a tool that, in the right hands, could renovate an unwelcoming culture in Abby\u2019s image\u2014crankiness, grief, and all."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/uncertain-attraction-in-work-in-progress-and-dare-me", "id": "dc873971-d075-3753-a2f4-5bf847ea6eb7", "title": "Uncertain Attraction in \u201cWork in Progress\u201d and \u201cDare Me\u201d", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Emily Nussbaum", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "Showtime\u2019s \u201cWork in Progress\u201d opens on a dark note, with its heroine threatening to kill herself in a hundred and eighty days if happiness doesn\u2019t come her way.\nMagically, that\u2019s just what she gets when she meets Chris, a twenty-two-year-old waiter who Abby (Abby McEnany) initially assumes is hitting on her straight sister.\n\u201cWork in Progress,\u201d like its heroine, is sweetly imperfect: not every bit lands, and Chris can feel, at moments, too good to be true.\nIn certain ways, \u201cWork in Progress\u201d is a mirror image of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s \u201cNanette,\u201d which argues that self-deprecation, especially for people like her and Abby, amounts to self-harm.\n\u201cWork in Progress\u201d takes the position that it might be something better: a tool that, in the right hands, could renovate an unwelcoming culture in Abby\u2019s image\u2014crankiness, grief, and all.", "pubDate": null}
