A third-party store, called SUP3R5, is releasing black PlayStation 5's as a call-back to the classic PS2 console. That means that the white plating that accompanies the day-one PS5 and DualSense controller will be black instead. Additionally, the age-old PlayStation logo will make an appearance and the colored circle, square, triangle, and cross (or \"X\" button for all you blasphemers out there) will be on the controller. Awesome, right? Well, there's a catch: The black PS5 stock will be very limited.", "According to GameSpot, the store is only providing 304 custom consoles so you'll have to secure your own black PS5 quickly. Of course, buying a regular PS5 console is already close to impossible, so good luck if the black version suits your fancy. You'll also be paying for the recolor as black PS5 packages (the black DualSense is included) are priced at $650 for digital editions and $750 for disc editions. The standalone black controllers are also more expensive at $100 rather than the normal $70.", "The black PS5 packages will be available for purchase on January 8 (this Friday) at 3 p.m. ET and 12 p.m. PT. They are expected to arrive at your doorstep (if you're lucky enough to actually claim one) at some point towards the end of spring.", "[Source: GameSpot]"], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "Jay Is A Jrpg Enthusiast", "Having Clocked In Thousands Of Hours In Franchises Like Final Fantasy", "Monster Hunter.
