Native women are murdered on reservations at a rate ten times the national average; there were more than five thousand reported cases of missing Native women in 2016 alone, and many more cases go unreported. Among the witnesses at the hearing was Mary Kathryn Nagle, the legal counsel for the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center and an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Nagle, in her testimony, noted that tribal nations do not have legal jurisdiction over non-Natives who commit crimes on reservations. This is one of the reasons, she said, that those who assault or murder Native women are so rarely caught and prosecuted. The Supreme Court revoked that jurisdiction in 1978; it was restored, in 2013, by a new provision in the Violence Against Women Act, which was reauthorized that year. But funding for VAWA had expired in February, 2019, and Nagle urged that it be swiftly reauthorized. Later, the subcommittee\u2019s ranking Republican, Paul Cook, noted the presence in the room of Wilson Pipestem, of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe, and said that he\u2019d once seen Pipestem in a play that had brought home for him the importance of VAWA for Native peoples. The chair of the subcommittee then slipped a piece of paper in front of Cook, who lifted it up to read it above his glasses. He turned to Nagle. \u201cOh!\u201d he said. \u201cI just found out you wrote the play.\u201d", "Nagle is one of the leading lawyers in the United States advocating for tribal sovereignty\u2014and also one of the country\u2019s most-produced Native playwrights. Her briefs have been cited in Supreme Court arguments, and her plays have been performed at major regional theatres across the U.S. The play that Cook saw was \u201cSliver of a Full Moon,\u201d which interweaves testimony from Native women abused by non-Native men with an account of the legal battle to reauthorize VAWA. The play was staged at Joe\u2019s Pub, in New York, and later at the law schools of Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. (Cook had seen a production in Cherokee, North Carolina, in 2015.)", "A month after the hearing, the House voted to reauthorize VAWA. Senate Republicans then blocked a vote on reauthorization. A new version of the bill was introduced by the Iowa Republican Joni Ernst, but it stripped away the jurisdiction for tribal courts. \u201cErnst\u2019s bill is based on the assumption that the protections for Native victims in VAWA 2013 must be rolled back because tribal courts are not capable of fairly administering justice,\u201d Nagle said, in a statement issued by the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, calling these \u201cpaternalistic restrictions\u201d a \u201cdisguise for prejudice.\u201d Joe Biden, who sponsored the original VAWA in 1994, promised to make its reauthorization, with tribal jurisdiction, a priority for his first hundred days as President. On March 17th, the House passed a new such version of the bill, with twenty-nine Republicans joining every Democrat in the chamber in support. The bill\u2019s fate in the deadlocked Senate is uncertain.", "Nagle believes that restoring tribal sovereignty depends on beating back degrading stereotypes that prop up discriminatory legal frameworks\u00ad, and that the theatre is one place where that fight needs to happen. \u201cMost people have never seen an authentic Native person portrayed onstage,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe more we become humans that non-Natives have to interact with, the more difficult it becomes to justify a legal narrative that dehumanizes us.\u201d She points to specific moments when the prejudice evident in American culture informed laws that disadvantaged Native people. The 1978 Supreme Court decision under discussion at the subcommittee hearing, for instance, relied on an 1823 precedent that ruled Native Americans could not exercise sovereignty because they were \u201csavages\u201d\u2014a ruling that paralleled the rise of redface performance in the age of Andrew Jackson. In Nagle\u2019s plays, on the other hand, Native actors portray complex protagonists confronting injustices both historical and contemporary. \u201cIf Arthur Miller had gone to law school, and also knew the true story of the lands we stand on, that would be Mary Kathryn,\u201d Madeline Sayet, who runs the Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program, and is a member of Mohegan Nation, told me. But challenging prejudice in American theatre, Nagle has found, is, in some ways, no easier than challenging it in American law.", "Nagle is in her late thirties. When she was a young girl, in Missouri, she liked to pretend that she was Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cI had a little basket with a dog that I would carry around, and I would sing \u2018Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\u2019 and people had to call me Dorothy,\u201d she told me, over lunch, at a brewpub in Portland, Oregon. \u201cIf they called me Mary Kathryn, I wouldn\u2019t respond.\u201d When we met, in 2019, she had just attended the first rehearsals for her play \u201cCrossing Mnisose,\u201d a commission from Portland Center Stage, which tells parallel stories about Sacajawea as a young Shoshone woman, leading Lewis and Clark across the Mnisose\u2014which European explorers renamed the Missouri\u2014and young Standing Rock protesters opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline along the same river, two centuries later. Two days before, she\u2019d taken a red-eye to Washington, D.C., to speak at a Smithsonian symposium on violence against Native women. She\u2019d just flown back that morning. In the interim, she had extensively rewritten the play. \u201cI\u2019m severely sleep-deprived, so my brain isn\u2019t functioning,\u201d she said, cutting into an elk burger. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten since 3 A.M.\u201d Then she gave me an impromptu twenty-minute lecture on misrepresentations of Sacajawea and her connection to the protests on the Missouri River.", "Nagle received the commission from Portland Center Stage in 2016. She had become frustrated by the historical narrative that had been constructed around Sacajawea, which insisted, as Nagle put it, that \u201cSacajawea\u2019s life was so hard because Native men are so violent. True,\u201d Nagle went on, \u201cshe was kidnapped when she was ten by a Hidatsa raid. She was Shoshone.\u201d But then, Nagle pointed out, a French fur trader, Charbonneau, purchased her. \u201cIt\u2019s documented in Lewis and Clark\u2019s journals that he beat her,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cFor two white men in 1804 to document that, it must have been very grotesque. And we know from Native oral histories that men with Lewis and Clark were raping Native women,\u201d she added. \u201cSo, I\u2019m, like, \u2018Right, I\u2019m writing about Sacajawea.\u2019 \u201d", "Nagle found a copy of Lewis and Clark\u2019s journals and began interviewing descendants of Sacajawea. Then she got a call from a former roommate, Jodi Archambault, who told Nagle that her brother Dave Archambault, then chairman of the Standing Rock Tribal Council, had been arrested, and needed help. Nagle went to Standing Rock. \u201cWhere that fight at Standing Rock happened is where Lewis and Clark came up the river,\u201d Nagle told me. \u201cThe Army Corps of Engineers that approved the pipeline is the subsequent entity for Lewis and Clark\u2019s Corps of Discovery. So, to me, the parallels were obvious when I was there in person.\u201d In addition to writing \u201cCrossing Mnisose,\u201d Nagle filed an amicus brief in Standing Rock\u2019s case against Dakota Access in federal district court, arguing that the Army Corps\u2019s assessment of the consequences of building the pipeline had failed to properly evaluate its effects on the public interest. The Army, Nagle contended, had not considered the increased rates of violence against Native women that would stem from the transient \u201cman camps\u201d assembled for pipeline labor, exacerbated by the legal loophole that prevents tribes from prosecuting non-Natives. The final section of her brief was titled \u201cIncreasing Violence Against Native Women is Not in the \u2018Public Interest.\u2019 \u201d (As she noted in her House testimony, the body of one missing woman from a reservation in North Dakota, Olivia Lone Bear, was found in 2018 in Lake Sakakawea. In March, 2020, a federal judge halted the pipeline and ordered the Army Corps to redo its environmental assessment.)", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much sleep she gets a night,\u201d Crystal Echo Hawk, a friend of Nagle\u2019s who runs #IllumiNative, an organization that aims to increase Native visibility, told me. \u201cShe goes into the zone on her little laptop, and you never know if she\u2019s working on a legal brief or a play.\u201d", "Nagle decided she wanted to become a lawyer when she was in the first grade. Her grandmother had told her that Nagle\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather John Ridge was the one of the country\u2019s first Native attorneys. Ridge helped the Cherokee Nation win a Supreme Court case upholding its jurisdiction, in 1832. But Andrew Jackson refused to enforce the decision, and Ridge, facing the loss of Cherokee lands, signed a treaty to relocate the nation from Georgia to what is now Oklahoma. The nation was forced onto the Trail of Tears, and another Cherokee faction assassinated Ridge and his father as traitors. In 2015, Nagle wrote a play, \u201cSovereignty,\u201d which intercuts Ridge\u2019s story with that of a twenty-first-century Cherokee lawyer who is abused by her non-Native husband, and who argues a case before the Supreme Court to uphold the tribal jurisdiction that Jackson was dedicated to destroying. \u201cEveryone in my family has desecrated Andrew Jackson\u2019s grave except me,\u201d Nagle told me. \u201cMy grandma spit on it. My sister peed on it.\u201d Later, she added, \u201cWell, I guess I did it in \u2018Sovereignty.\u2019 \u201d In 2018, \u201cSovereignty\u201d became the first play by a Native writer to be performed at Arena Stage, in Washington, D.C. After performances began, she received a note, in an elegant envelope, commending her on the show, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (Ginsburg was the second Supreme Court Justice to laud Nagle\u2019s theatrical work: in 2011, a reading of one of her plays at the Smithsonian was introduced by Sonia Sotomayor.)", "Nagle wrote her first plays as an undergraduate at Georgetown, where she majored in peace and justice studies, and acted in student productions. One of the plays she performed in was \u201cCloud 9,\u201d by Caryl Churchill, in which the same cast portrays a rigidly patriarchal family at the height of British imperialism in the first act and, in the second, the descendants of that family, in sexually fluid, post-colonial London, a century later. \u201cThere was an artistic statement in her doubling that you can only do in theatre,\u201d Nagle told me. \u201cThere\u2019s something about watching a live, human actor go from one character to another.\u201d This technique has become a hallmark of Nagle\u2019s style: her plays overlay the past and the present to reveal patterns that persist. In \u201cCrossing Mnisose,\u201d Sacajawea doubles as Carey, a Standing Rock activist who questions the reliability of Lewis and Clark\u2019s journals. Lewis, scouting trade routes for the Corps of Discovery, becomes the colonel running the Army Corps of Engineers, securing the Mnisose River for the oil pipeline.", "After college, Nagle studied environmental law at Tulane, and clerked in federal courts before becoming an attorney for Quinn Emanuel, a white-shoe firm in Manhattan. She continued writing plays, but she didn\u2019t consider her craft as much more than a hobby at the time. Then, in 2011, the National Museum of the American Indian held a staged reading of Nagle\u2019s play \u201cWaaxe\u2019s Law,\u201d about Chief Standing Bear, a Ponca chief who was part of the court case that first recognized Native Americans as persons under federal law. Wilson Pipestem, who has his own law firm in Oklahoma, which advocates for tribal rights, saw a staging of the play in 2012, and approached Nagle about it. \u201cI have blood relatives who are Ponca, and I asked her what the basis was for her writing about Chief Standing Bear,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe said that some of the play came directly from transcripts of his actual trial. I was amazed.\u201d He invited her to join his firm, where she is now a partner.", "That same year, Nagle received a fellowship to be part of the Emerging Writers Group at the Public Theatre, in New York. She spent part of her time there workshopping \u201cManahatta,\u201d a chronicle of land fraud against the Lenape people by Dutch colonists in the seventeenth century and Lehman Brothers in the twenty-first. One actor plays Jane Snake, a financial analyst newly hired on Wall Street, and also Le-le-wa\u2019-you, a Lenape fur trader; another portrays a chief of mortgage-backed securities at Lehman Brothers and also the head of the Dutch West India Company, bent on turning communal, matrilineal land into private property. The Public Theatre staged a workshop performance of the play in 2014. At the time, Nagle was close to giving up on getting produced. \u201cTheatres didn\u2019t know how to read scripts about Native people,\u201d Nagle told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to judge what\u2019s authentic or what\u2019s not. All they know is what they\u2019ve seen in Western movies or on the back of a football jersey.\u201d Ned Blackhawk, a Western Shoshone professor of history at Yale, took a group of students to Joe\u2019s Pub at the Public Theatre to see a staged reading of \u201cSliver of a Full Moon\u201d later that year. Afterward, he recalled, he approached Nagle. \u201cI told her, \u2018I would like to work with you and bring this to Yale.\u2019 She said, \u2018I\u2019m done doing these plays!\u2019 She was sitting there with a knee injury on crutches in New York, having had to find funding and run a production of a bunch of people in a city where most of them didn\u2019t live. The logistical challenge of running a mobile theatre was kind of killing her.\u201d Blackhawk subsequently created the Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program to support the work of Native playwrights. It launched in 2015, with Nagle as its executive director.", "Two years later, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, one of the country\u2019s largest repertory theatres, announced that it would produce \u201cManahatta\u201d in its 2018 season. But gaining access to big-budget theatres brought its own challenges. The initial set design at O.S.F. had Lenape characters posed in a seventeenth-century diorama. Nagle \u201cwas triggered by it,\u201d Laurie Woolery, the play\u2019s director, who restaged it at Yale Rep last year, told me. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to see another play where we\u2019re reduced to a diorama.\u2019 So we scrapped the design.\u201d", "At Portland Center Stage, Lauren Cordova was brought on as a Shoshone cultural consultant for Sacagawea\u2019s story, and Suzanne Blue Star Boy was hired as a Dakota consultant for the Standing Rock narrative. \u201cIf you want to tell a Native story,\u201d Cordova, who is Shoshone-Bannock and Taos Pueblo, told me, \u201cconsult some Native folks who are from the same tribe or Nation as your characters.\u201d She and Nagle shared a joke about a comment posted, by a non-Native, below a video of the Standing Rock protests, about how \u201cthe sacred winds are blowing,\u201d Cordova recalled. \u201cNeither of us knew what that was supposed to mean!\u201d Mocking non-Native stereotypes about indigenous people is a reliable source of humor in Nagle\u2019s plays. At the rehearsal table for \u201cCrossing Mnisose,\u201d one of the non-Native actors dangled a purple feather from a keychain. \u201cThis is my spirit feather,\u201d he joked. Nagle added, \u201cFrom a purple eagle!\u201d \u201cIts name was Fruit Loop,\u201d the actor Robert I. Mesa, who is Navajo and Soboba, said solemnly.", "One of the most-produced plays by a Native playwright in recent years is \u201cThe Thanksgiving Play,\u201d by Larissa FastHorse, of the Sicangu Lakota Nation. It\u2019s a satire of white liberals trying to create a culturally sensitive school pageant about the first Thanksgiving. The punch line: to be truly respectful, they decide, they can\u2019t include any Native Americans. The meta-joke is that the \u201cThe Thanksgiving Play\u201d doesn\u2019t include any Native characters, either. FastHorse was tired of theatres telling her that they couldn\u2019t find Native actors for her plays, so she wrote one that anybody could produce. It worked.", "Combatting Native erasure is an essential project for Nagle. At the end of \u201cManahatta,\u201d Jane Snake says, \u201cWe are still here.\u201d In the theatre, the line has a double resonance. The Lenape have not been wiped out from the continent, despite centuries of genocide and colonialism, and they are physically present, onstage, at that moment.", "Reviewing \u201cSovereignty\u201d for the Washington Post, the critic Peter Marks wrote that, while his two hours in the theatre \u201cdid not feel misspent,\u201d the experience had \u201cless to do with aesthetics than edification.\u201d The play, he added, \u201cmight have felt much lighter had the playwright not believed she had so much explaining to do.\u201d Nagle regards this as a blinkered perspective on her work. \u201cMy plays are educational because we\u2019ve been erased,\u201d she told me. \u201cBy sharing our stories, we\u2019re educating a non-Native audience. A lot of white male critics think they\u2019re supposed to go to the theatre and not learn anything but be entertained. And as soon as they start learning something, then it\u2019s educational\u2014it\u2019s not art.\u201d", "When \u201cSovereignty\u201d was staged at Marin Theatre Company, in the fall of 2019, Nagle got in a public debate with the critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, Lily Janiak. Janiak had called the play\u2019s characters \u201ctwo-dimensional,\u201d and described some of their actions as \u201carbitrarily imposed by a playwright\u2019s conceit instead of emerging from how real people would actually act.\u201d In particular, Janiak wrote, \u201cWhy would a super-smart, self-confident Cherokee woman whose whole life is dedicated to protecting the women of her tribe marry a white guy whose anti-Indian prejudice needs only a few drinks and a nudge to come to the surface?\u201d Nagle wrote a lengthy response, arguing that Janiak\u2019s interpretation revealed a variety of prejudices\u2014intelligence doesn\u2019t save women from abusive relationships, she noted, and anti-Indian bigotry is often, as in the case of this character, a means of wielding power and asserting control above all. \u201cWriting his behavior off as a blatant \u2018anti-Indian\u2019 prejudice exposed by a few drinks of alcohol misses the entire reason so many of our Native women are raped, are murdered, or go missing: many non-Indian men have discovered the legal loophole, and they use it,\u201d Nagle wrote. (In a later column, responding to criticism from Nagle and others, Janiak wrote that \u201carts criticism is a two-way street,\u201d and that she relies \u201con artists and readers to tell me when they think my work has missed the mark.\u201d)", "Nagle often says that she walks in the footsteps of earlier generations of Native playwrights: N. Scott Momaday, who is Kiowa; William Yellow Robe, who is Assiniboine; and Lynn Riggs, who was Cherokee, and whose play \u201cGreen Grow the Lilacs\u201d may be the only work by a Native playwright to be produced on Broadway, in 1931. (Rodgers and Hammerstein later adapted it, though not without erasures of their own, into the musical \u201cOklahoma!\u201d) And she told me that she draws strength from the other Native playwrights who are rising with her, among them Larissa FastHorse; DeLanna Studi, who is Cherokee; and Tara Moses, a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. \u201cNative Americans have been telling these stories for a very long time,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cWhat\u2019s different now is that non-Native theatres are letting us tell them outside our own homes.\u201d", "Last year was, of course, an impossible time for American theatre, but Nagle continues to develop new plays. Shortly before the pandemic, a collaboration with the Cheyenne and Hudolgee Muscogee writer Suzan Shown Harjo, \u201cReclaiming One Star,\u201d about the origins of the Washington N.F.L. team\u2019s name, premi\u00e8red at the Colorado New Play Summit. (Five months later, the team announced that it would change its name.) Nagle is also working on a commission from Yale Repertory Theatre to adapt the Osage author Charles Red Corn\u2019s novel \u201cA Pipe for February,\u201d about the Osage murders in the nineteen-twenties, and on a new commission for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival\u2019s American Revolutions history-play cycle. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival recently has put its production of \u201cManahatta\u201d online; it will stream until April 24th. And Nagle\u2019s legal advocacy has continued unabated. She submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in a case debating whether the Muscogee (Creek) Nation\u2019s reservation in Oklahoma existed; she argued that upholding reservation boundaries was essential to protecting Native women from sexual assault. In July, the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 in the Nation\u2019s favor. A few months later, the American Bar Association hosted a virtual reading of \u201cSliver of a Full Moon,\u201d and Deb Haaland, then a congresswoman, joined the post-show discussion; last month, Haaland was confirmed as the first Native Secretary of the Interior.", "Nagle also continues to work on the campaign to reauthorize VAWA. She told me that attending the ceremony, in 2013, where President Barack Obama signed the reauthorization into law was one of the high points of her life. \u201cHearing the President say he was affirming the inherent right of tribal nations to protect their women on tribal land\u2014I never in a million years thought I would hear an American President say that,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was like a complete turnaround from the Andrew Jackson days.\u201d She hopes she gets to hear it again before long."], "authors": ["Daniel Pollack-Pelzner", "Daniel Pollack-Pelzne", "Philip Delori", "Vinson Cunningha"], "keywords": ["mary", "plays", "tribal", "later", "theatre", "standing", "onstage", "changes", "told", "women", "court", "kathryn", "play", "native", "nagle"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
