They don't know what it is. It's not in the DNA. It's not in the mindset. They see it as mostly froth. It's fun. It's fantasy.", "When Meghan and Harry did their interview they were shocked because Americans have this idea of this country as being a rock. It's quiet. It's staid. The royal family is this. They don't have a clue.", "So when you start to talk about, to an American audience, how deeply embedded this is within the culture, how it underpins... how the class system sits beneath it and almost holds it up, and that, in fact, to be British, to a certain extent, is to actually take a view about the monarchy.

It actually depends on a certain amount of invisibility.", "...came here to be in the theatre because this country makes the best theatre in the world. There is no comparison to British theatre when it starts to do its thing. And that's because it contains all the things we're talking about. They put it on the stage.", "In fact, this whole country is about the stage. And what happened was a stage actress who became a princess said, right, lights on. Let's pull the curtain down.
