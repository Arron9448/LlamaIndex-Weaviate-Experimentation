I'm starting off light, with turkey bolognese and spaghetti and chicken parmigiana. I also do a mean egg sandwich, an English muffin egg sandwich. I'm on my way.\u201d", "It\u2019s partly thanks to Diddy\u2019s newfound culinary skills that he\u2019s accidentally gained a new Gen Z following on TikTok, where he\u2019s acquired 1.3 million followers and counting for his goofy, candid windows into the life of a hip-hop superstar. One highlight sees Diddy in the kitchen on the night before Thanksgiving, brining a turkey and prepping a yam bake\u2014\u201cshout out to all my late-night chefs prepping for tomorrow,\u201d he says at the end of the clip.", "\u201cMy kids actually run my TikTok, you know what I'm saying,\u201d Diddy laughs. \u201cThrough this time I've been trying to disconnect from social media and stay focused\u2014I didn't even know that I became a TikTok star until they told me.\u201d It\u2019s this opportunity to spend meaningful downtime with his family that Diddy sees as one of the few silver linings of this strange year. \u201cI'm not usually really extra into the Christmas spirit, but this year I am,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis year I made a pledge to myself that I'm really going to enjoy the holidays. I haven't had a chance to enjoy it properly since I was a child, so I had a meeting with my kids and I told them that I was going to get into the holiday spirit, because I want to feel like I felt when I was 10 years old and I got that bike for Christmas.\u201d", "All the same, Diddy is quick to note that this year\u2019s festivities will be underscored by his awareness for those less fortunate, given so many are struggling in the wake of both the pandemic and a new recession. \u201cA big part of this year is giving,\u201d Diddy continues. \u201cI had to tell my kids we have to learn and we have to evolve from this situation. We're doing something down in Miami, a big giveaway, really spreading the Christmas spirit beyond our household to the community. That's what I'm teaching my girls now. They\u2019re gonna give daddy some gifts, but they're gonna also make sure that they give gifts to other people in the community that aren't as blessed.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s been some crazy times,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy wish, no matter how clich\u00e9d it sounds, is that everybody can just have 72 hours out from all of the oppression and all of the treachery that's going on right now, that would be my wish.\u201d", "That\u2019s not to say, however, that Diddy won\u2019t be making sure there\u2019s plenty of family fun to be had in the lead-up to Christmas. It would be remiss not to ask him\u2014as someone who is clearly a consummate host\u2014about his ultimate holiday entertaining tips. \u201cWell, you gotta have some DeLe\u00f3n,\u201d he starts, firmly. \u201cBut most of all you\u2019ve got to have great music. Music is very, very key, and also food that doesn't take the dance out of you, so something light, something clean, something that'll keep you dancing. It\u2019s not a party unless you're dancing. You could be at a get-together, a dinner, but a celebration? You have to have dancing.\u201d", "The \u201cRepo-loma\u201d", "1.5 oz DeLe\u00f3n Reposado Tequila", "1 oz grapefruit juice", "0.75 oz lime juice", "0.5 oz simple syrup", "Pinch of kosher salt and club soda", "Grapefruit wedge garnish", "Shaken with ice", "Served in a highball/Collins glass over ice"], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["kids", "tiktok", "entertaining", "hes", "holiday", "diddy", "family", "really", "miami", "ultimate", "spirit", "tips", "tequila", "oz", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
