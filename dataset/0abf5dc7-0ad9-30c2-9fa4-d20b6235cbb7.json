Superstar abilities are always on, meaning players with the Shutdown ability, like Jaguars corner Jalen Ramsey, always have an increased chance of disrupting receiver catches. X-Factor players, however, must activate their X-Factor by meeting specific gameplay goals. For instance, for Adam Thielen to earn his Double Me X-Factor that increases the chances of him winning an aggressive catch against single coverage, he first must catch two 20-plus yard passes. Once the X-Factor is turned on, it can be turned off, and the conditions for this are similarly prescriptive. Odell Beckham Jr. falls out of the zone and his X-Factor turns off when you don\u2019t target him on consecutive plays.", "Both X-Factors and Superstar abilities can be very useful, but some are definitely handier than others. Some aren\u2019t even used by any players at launch, and others might be more helpful to some users depending on their play style. Conversely, if you\u2019re playing against an opponent with these abilities, you\u2019re going to want to know what you\u2019re going up against.", "These abilities are used throughout the game, but they can only be switched in/out in Madden Ultimate Team and QB1 Face of the Franchise. Otherwise, they\u2019re tied to specific players in regular franchise modes \u2013 including players you draft.", "To see the current list of which players have which abilities, their full descriptions, and the requisites to turn on/off the X-Factors, click into the special rotating menu (the far-left panel at the bottom of the screen) from the game\u2019s main menu screen. Developer EA Tiburon plans to add and subtract from the list during the season, tweaking which players have what, so you\u2019ll have to be on the lookout for that.", "If you have your own thoughts on which X-Factors or Superstar abilities are valuable, list them down in the comments section below.", "Madden 20 X-Factors & Superstar Abilities", "I\u2019ve broken down the game\u2019s current abilities based on a few broad categories:", "ELITE COMBOS", "These abilities combine two separate Superstar abilities, making them rare and particularly effective.

Some gamers use them to great effect, but if you don\u2019t use them, then obviously these abilities won\u2019t help you at all. The game\u2019s Superstar Abilities revolving around hot routes apply to QBs as well as running backs, receivers, and tight ends.", "Superstar Abilities: Backfield Master, Hot Route Master, Outside Apprentice, RB Apprentice, Route Apprentice, Slot Apprentice, WR Apprentice", "ROUTES & CATCHES", "These Superstar abilities and X-Factors naturally aid in specific routes and catch types, making them all useful. Of particular note is the X-Factor Double Me (increased chance of an Aggressive catch against single coverage) given how powerful aggressive catches are in the game. The Satellite, Backfield Mismatch, and Safety Valve abilities relate to running backs, while Playmaker applies to that user-control feature, so milage on these will vary depending on the user. I like doing slants, so Slant specialist is good to hold onto the ball while going over the middle, but Slot-O-Matic might be more generally effective since it confers different advantages to short routes from the slot.", "Superstar Abilities: Backfield Mismatch, Cross Specialist, Curl Specialist, Double-Move Elite, Grab-N-Go, In Specialist, Matchup Nightmare, Playmaker, Post Specialist, Red Zone Threat, Route Technician, Safety Valve, Slant Specialist, Slot-O-Matic, Streak Specialist", "X-Factors: Double Me, Max Security, RAC Em Up, Satellite", "QB MOBILITY", "Madden 20 has a new control allowing QBs to pull down the ball, giving them full access to any ball carrier moves in the pocket. Apart from that, this year\u2019s abilities add to your mobility in and out of the pocket, and are pretty much good across the board (see below for a list of some of the more questionable abilities). My favorite is Russell Wilson\u2019s Blitz Radar, which highlights extra blitzers. Also, Protected and Secure Protector relate to the o-line, so you can't ignore those either.", "Superstar Abilities: Agile Extender, Anchored Extender, Escape Artist, Fastbreak, Protected, Secure Protector", "X-Factors: Blitz Radar", "QB THROWING", "Apart from the mobility-related abilities for QBs listed above, most of the rest are related to throwing accuracy under specific conditions (called Deadeye) and precision passing. The ones I gravitate toward are the accuracy abilities when outside the pocket like Dashing Deadeye (when throwing on the run outside the pocket) and Roaming Deadeye (when feet are set outside the pocket). I also like the Fearless X-Factor (accuracy unaffected by defensive pressure) and Sleight of Hand (improves pump fake), especially since the latter is easier to perform this year. Currently nobody has the Gunslinger ability, which speeds up the animation and ball speed for bullet passes, so this is one I'm really looking forward to using since it's often paramount to get the ball out quickly when the receiver is between zones.", "Superstar Abilities: Conductor, Dashing Deadeye, Gift Wrapped, Gunslinger, Gutsy Scrambler, Identifier, Inside Deadeye, Last Ditch, Lofting Deadeye, Long Range Deadeye, No-Look Deadeye, Pass Lead Elite, Pocket Deadeye, Pocket Lead, QB Playmaker, Red Zone Deadeye, Roaming Deadeye, Secure Protector, Set Feet Lead, Sideline Deadeye, Sleight of Hand", "X-Factors: Bazooka, Fearless, Gambler, Pro Reads, Run N Gun", "RUNNING WITH AUTHORITY", "This year\u2019s game has improved the feel of the running game, and these abilities help that tremendously, from powering up your stiff arm, juke, hurdle, and spin to improving the blocking inside and out. MUT head-to-head gameplay is awash with ball carrier special moves, so these abilities fit right in. That being said, the current X-Factors in this department seem limited (see Are They Worth It? below for more). If I had to go with one, I'd look for a player with Outside Zone Guru since outside runs can be big gainers, and sometimes the A.I. blocking needs help on the perimeter.", "Superstar Abilities: Arm Bar, Balance Beam, Bruiser, Bulldozer, Human Joystick, Inside Zone Guru, Juke Box, Leap Frog, Outside Zone Guru, Pin-n-Pull Guru, Spin Cycle", "X-Factors: First One Free, Freight Train, Wrecking Ball", "DOMINANT DEFENSE", "There aren\u2019t many that fit into this category, but I think almost all of them bring something to the table, affecting play from pass breakups to defensive line moves, better tackling, hits, and interceptions. A handful of elite abilities combine multiple abilities, so you know these are valuable. Among the X-Factors, if I had to choose, it would would be Zone Hawk, which increases the rate of knockouts and INTs. Reinforcement is a close second, which helps defensive backs shed blocks and make stops closer to the line of scrimmage, but also aids in pass disruption.", "Superstar Abilities: Acrobat, Edge Threat, Edge Threat Elite, Enforcer, Finesse Specialist, Lurker, Man Up, Pass Rush Elite, Pick Artist, Power Specialist, Reach Elite, Run Stopper, Secure Tackler, Strip Specialist, Tackle Supreme, Under Pressure, Unfakeable, Universal Coverage, Zoned Out", "X-Factors: Fearmonger, Reinforcement, Run Stuffer, Shutdown, Unstoppable Force, Zone Hawk", "GETTING INTO THE ZONE", "The Clutch, Homer, and Indoor Baller Superstar abilities all get you into the zone for your X-Factors faster, making them all useful assuming you like your player's X-Factor.", "ARE THEY WORTH IT?", "I wouldn\u2019t say any Superstar ability or X-Factor is completely worthless, but some are less useful than others.", "Pro Reads (X-Factor) \u2013 While it sounds great that your first open read as a QB is highlighted, in practice I found that either I already made the read before the A.I. or it simply wasn\u2019t useful to me, like when the running back is highlighted coming out of the backfield when I'm looking to push the ball downfield instead.", "Bazooka (X-Factor) \u2013 Cover star Patrick Mahomes has this, and I\u2019m as big a fan of his as anyone, but frankly I don\u2019t know how many situations I\u2019m going to be in where I have to throw an 80-yard bomb. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not useful, I\u2019d just rather have another X-Factor instead.", "Conductor (Superstar) \u2013 This lets QBs make pre-play adjustments twice as fast, except audibles. Most players rarely have a problem with this in the first place.", "Fast Break (Superstar) \u2013 This gives QBs faster control to execute QB-designed runs.

In practice, I didn\u2019t find it super useful.

If you\u2019re outside of the pocket you can always throw it away instead.", "Strip Specialist (Superstar) \u2013 This makes you immune to broken tackles when going in for the strip.
