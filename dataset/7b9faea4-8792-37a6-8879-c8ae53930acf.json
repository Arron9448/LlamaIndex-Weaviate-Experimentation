{"paragraphs": ["In late October, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re posted an Instagram image of Qiyana, a star of the multiplayer online battle-arena game League of Legends, in a limited-edition Louis Vuitton \u201cprestige skin.\u201d The Vuitton artistic director of women\u2019s collections isn\u2019t one of the eight million people who simultaneously play the game each day\u2014launched in 2009, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most popular esports\u2014or one of the nearly 100 million unique viewers who watched last year\u2019s world championship. But augmented reality\u2014along with an abiding love of sci-fi and time travel\u2014is absolutely a personal obsession.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating\u2014the frontier where fantasy begins and reality ends,\u201d says the designer. \u201cWhere it\u2019s especially interesting for us is how a character that was built in the game becomes an influence on the real world, and how people will want to dress in her looks.\u201d To facilitate that, Ghesqui\u00e8re has created virtual outfits for Qiyana and her fellow League of Legends champion Senna\u2014\u201cskins,\u201d in gamer parlance\u2014that players can earn in-game (or buy, if their battle skills aren\u2019t up to snuff). For the real world, he\u2019s combined the LV and LoL logos and produced a capsule collection of leather goods and street-smart, sporty riffs on the in-game clothes, in color-blocked tech jersey and chrome leather, that hits stores this month.", "Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re with Qiyana, a virtual champion from League of Legends.

Qiyana and Senna are members of a virtual hip-hop group, True Damage, featuring vocals from real-life singers and musicians, that released a music video for their song \u201cGiants\u201d at the 2019 LoL World Championship Finals in November. (Qiyana wears a Ghesqui\u00e8re-designed Louis Vuitton look in the video.) If the experience of 2018\u2019s virtual LoL group, the K-pop band K/DA, is any indication, True Damage\u2019s tune will likely chart. And if esports are now producing hit songs IRL, why not sold-out Vuitton Speedys and Neverfulls?", "\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about this project is how alive it is,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. \u201cMillions of gamers will jump in, and if they reach a higher level of difficulty they\u2019ll be able to enjoy Qiyana and Senna in their Vuitton looks. Look at how kids love Snapchat and the transformations they can make,\u201d he continues. \u201cThis is an extension of that. To be able to dress in virtual reality as you wish\u2014that\u2019s a possibility now.\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re was extremely impressed with the ways in which League of Legends\u2019 developers brought his designs to life. \u201cYou feel the fabric: how it\u2019s moving, the weight of the texture. It\u2019s quite incredible.\u201d", "Will customers be shopping for Louis Vuitton products for their online avatars in the not-too-distant future? Probably yes.
