But there\u2019s one major difference between us \u2014 Fran is definitely not a techie.", "fran lebowitz", "Hello. Hello?", "kara swisher", "Hi, Fran?", "fran lebowitz", "Yeah, whoever this other person is, I cannot hear them.", "kara swisher", "This is Kara Swisher. How are you doing?", "fran lebowitz", "Hi, I really can\u2019t hear you very well.", "kara swisher", "Oh, OK. I\u2019m going to turn up my volume a lot. How is that? Is that good? Can you hear better?", "fran lebowitz", "It\u2019s better, not good. I hear you well enough.", "kara swisher", "Well enough. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to go for. So I have a question. Now I know you famously don\u2019t own a computer. But I heard you actually do have email. Is that correct?", "fran lebowitz", "I have no internet connection in this apartment.", "kara swisher", "OK, do you actually have an email address?", "fran lebowitz", "I do not.", "kara swisher", "You do not. And but you do have a Twitter handle. Is that correct?", "fran lebowitz", "That is not me. The first time I was aware of a computer that someone would have in their house, a friend of mine, who was a screenwriter got one. At that point, they were called word processors. And she said, I got this incredible thing. You have to come see it. So I went to her apartment. I looked at it, and I thought, this is just a very fast kind of typewriter. So I don\u2019t have a typewriter. I don\u2019t need this. Now, of course, I didn\u2019t know the entire world would go into this machine. I had no idea. So it wasn\u2019t like I decided I\u2019m never going to have these machines. I never had the first one. It\u2019s not a stance. It\u2019s not an ideology. It was kind of an accident.", "kara swisher", "Would you imagine joining at this date? Because there\u2019s now voice stuff. There\u2019s all kinds of holograms. There\u2019s virtual reality. There\u2019s all kinds of different ways now to interact with technology.", "fran lebowitz", "It just doesn\u2019t have an appeal to me. I mean, I realize there\u2019s numerous things going on in the world that I\u2019m not engaged in. But that was always the case.", "kara swisher", "All right, so one of the things I am is fascinated by the new, the new, new thing.", "fran lebowitz", "Oh, new things. Certainly, when I was young, I was much more interested in new things. I think this is universal. I\u2019ve never been that riveted by \u2014 and any kind of machine or technology, I\u2019ve never been that interested in. To me, this goes under the category of science. And no one is less of a scientist than I am.", "kara swisher", "I\u2019m not particularly scientific, so it\u2019s kind of interesting to think about someone who\u2019s not interested in this at all. And I\u2019m completely surrounded by it.", "fran lebowitz", "Oh, let me assure you. I\u2019ve owned the same car since 1978. And it was maybe five years ago I figured out how to open the hood of the car.", "kara swisher", "[LAUGHS] What car was that? What kind of car?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I have, actually, an exquisite car. I have a 1979 Checker Marathon. The Checker Car Company made mostly taxis, but they also made a passenger car. And so that\u2019s the car I have. I had this car not my entire life, but since 1978.", "kara swisher", "Do you still drive it?", "fran lebowitz", "I do.", "kara swisher", "Where?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, it depends. I mean, when I first bought it, I was young. I was 27, and I used to drive it all around town. And a friend of mine said, don\u2019t drive that car all over town because everyone knows it\u2019s your car. And I said, that\u2019s ridiculous. This is New York. There\u2019s a billion people here. And one night, I left the car in front of someone\u2019s apartment. And when I came down in the morning, there was a note under my windshield from a friend of mine, who lived in the neighborhood, saying, what are you doing in this neighborhood? So I stopped doing that.", "kara swisher", "So why not do things like tweet or be on Twitter or social media? What is your\u2014 you think you\u2019d be good at it?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I mean, I can tell you from\u2014 very often, people have said to me\u2014 not since this has come out\u2014 you should be on the internet, Fran. There\u2019s a lot of great things about you. I said, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s also a lot of horrible things about me. And I don\u2019t want to see all these things all the time. And as far as Twitter is concerned, I\u2014 and I don\u2019t remember when this was. It was several years ago. I was standing outside of a restaurant in New York and smoking a cigarette. And an actor, who I recognized\u2014 I did not know him\u2014 stopped. And he was walking past, and he said, thanks, I really am enjoying our conversation on Twitter. Thanks for all the great things you say about me and my performance in this. And I didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. And when I told him it wasn\u2019t me, he became furious at me.", "kara swisher", "At you.", "fran lebowitz", "I said, this is not me. I don\u2019t have Twitter. And I think the reason he became angry is he was embarrassed, you know?", "kara swisher", "Right.", "fran lebowitz", "And then I met the guy, whose name I now cannot think of, who owns Twitter, invented Twitter. You probably \u2014", "kara swisher", "Jack Dorsey.", "fran lebowitz", "Yes, I met him, and I told him this. And I said, you have to fix this because it\u2019s not fair that someone pretends to be me, and people are talking to this person or tweeting with them or whatever. And he said, oh, here\u2019s what you have to do. You have to open a Twitter account called @TheRealFranLebowitz. I said, here\u2019s what I have to do? Do I own Twitter? This is what you have to do! But of course, as you are aware, that is not what they do, and that, to me, is outrageous.", "kara swisher", "So what happened? What happened then?", "fran lebowitz", "Nothing. I mean, I\u2019m sure this is something among the many things that people who own these companies do not have to do, is be in any way responsible for this stuff. I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t open a Twitter account. And for all I know, there\u2019s one or two or 30 people pretending to be me on Twitter.", "kara swisher", "Well, if you had to tweet, what would you tweet?", "fran lebowitz", "I would tweet nothing.", "kara swisher", "Nothing.", "fran lebowitz", "I would tweet nothing.", "kara swisher", "OK.", "fran lebowitz", "I know tons of people do this. I don\u2019t care if they do it. But I don\u2019t want to do it. But I really object to people being able to do it as someone else.", "kara swisher", "Yeah. Well, there\u2019s been a little issue with the impact of social media on our culture with President Trump and the attack on the Capitol. A lot of it was fomented online on social media. So you\u2019re right to be angry at them. You talk about it in \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City\u201c, the idea of these people in Silicon Valley having so much power.", "fran lebowitz", "I think I could be wrong, but I really think what happened was when this started, certainly no one in power, by which I mean political power, had the slightest idea of what this was. I mean, there is an enormous gap, first of all, in age between most of these people and politicians. So it became \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the biggest industry in the country, but it\u2019s certainly among, if not the most, influential. Now do I think it should be regulated? I absolutely do. Any industry that has this huge effect on so many people should be regulated.", "kara swisher", "So I think of you as an influencer of a different era. How do you look at yourself? How do you define yourself? Because on the show, you said, I have no power, but I\u2019m filled with opinions.", "fran lebowitz", "I have no power. I say something I think, or I offer my opinion. Very often, people become enraged by this, and this startles me, because I have no power to affect these things. If I say I think that Twitter should be regulated, it doesn\u2019t mean it gets regulated. No matter what I say, it doesn\u2019t mean that something happens because I say this. People should be outraged at people who have power, not people who do not have power. As I said, by power, I mean political power, or even financial power, which I also don\u2019t have.", "kara swisher", "Well, don\u2019t you think you have influence with your opinions? I mean, you are a commentator. You\u2019re kind of an influencer of a different type.", "fran lebowitz", "Well I know this word exists, influencer. I know what it\u2019s supposed to mean. It seems largely, by the way, to be a commercial enterprise to me. So that the same way they now call commercial short films, they\u2019re still commercials. So you can call yourself an influencer, you\u2019re still a shill, in lots of ways. So I never had the experience of\u2014 not often had the experience\u2014 of people listening to what I say or reading what I write and then doing what I say. That\u2019s what I think of as influence.", "kara swisher", "Right. So when you do have opinions, people are moved by them, and then people get upset. I assume you know about cancel culture, this thing that exists largely on the internet, but it moves to the analog quite a bit.", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I\u2019m aware of it. I believe I know what it is. I mean, I think it depends what it\u2019s about. In other words, there seems to be a very high level of outrage over things that are both trivial and monumental. You know, so that if someone says something or does something on the Internet that exposes them as, say, a racist, fine, cancel them. We don\u2019t need any more racists. We have plenty. There just seems to be the same level of outrage over every single thing. So I don\u2019t think you should be canceled if you color your hair. But if you are discovered to be a racist, fine, cancel them.", "kara swisher", "And do you think it goes too far? Because cancel culture is about you don\u2019t get to listen to them anymore. You don\u2019t get to hear them. You shouldn\u2019t listen to them as an artist. I think James Levine, you were also talking about.", "fran lebowitz", "OK, so James Levine was the director of the Metropolitan Opera. And he was accused of having sexually harassed boys. He was fired from the Metropolitan Opera. I agreed if these things were true, that he should be fired from his job. I did not agree that they should stop selling his recordings. Numerous people, when that happened, said, I can\u2019t listen to him anymore without thinking about this. And I thought, well, I can. I mean, a recording is not a person. So I objected to that. I did not object to his firing. So that was my point.", "kara swisher", "OK, so you\u2019ve been writing a lot more, but you\u2019ve managed to make a living purely on your wit. You\u2019ve done a little acting, and you\u2019re a professional public speaker. But mostly, people pay to hear your opinions. Why do you think people want to listen to you?", "fran lebowitz", "I think because it amuses them. People want to be amused. It\u2019s a kind of entertainment. I take questions from the audience when I do these things or when I did them before the pandemic. And I could tell people would ask me questions, weird questions just in the hopes I would say something funny, not because the subject was important \u2014 even to them.", "kara swisher", "So do you consider yourself an observational comic, a humorist, a social scientist, a raconteur? I mean, that\u2019s an old word, but \u2014", "fran lebowitz", "That is a good one. I\u2019m certainly not a social scientist. I\u2019m not any sort of scientist. I never thought about it that much. I mean, I think of myself as a writer even when I don\u2019t write because I thought of myself as a writer since I was about six years old. So how you think about yourself and how you cannot control how other people think about you. So I would very much like to be able to write. Obviously, if I could write, I would be writing. I do not know why I don\u2019t write, so obviously, it\u2019s some giant personal problem I have.", "kara swisher", "There\u2019s all kinds of people that do some version of what you do, but did you have any idols growing up in this area?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I\u2019m not given much to worship or even fandom, but certainly, I had childhood idols, which is really the last time. I mean, in \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City\u201c, I think I talk about Leonard Bernstein. He was one of my childhood idols. Dag Hammarskjold was one of my childhood idols. No one even knows who he is now.", "kara swisher", "I do. Hello. I love Dag Hammarskjold.", "fran lebowitz", "I loved him, like, so deeply, I have a photograph of him on my refrigerator. I almost bought an apartment that I could not afford and that was too small because it was in a building named after him that had a bust of him outside. So he was the head of the UN, and he was killed in a plane crash. And there are many people that believed he was murdered. I was certainly not aware of that as a child. But when I was a child, my class at school was taken to the UN for a tour of the UN, and children were very obedient. And so we were lined up according to height, and we were walked through the UN, and I was completely in awe of the \u2014 I was obsessed with the UN when I was a child. And I kept looking for Dag Hammarskjold. I was certain I would see him there. And we were being led through the UN, and a man walked past. And I thought it was Dag Hammarskjold. And I just automatically followed him out of the line, and he disappeared. And I pushed a door, and every alarm in the UN went off. And I burst into tears. I didn\u2019t know what I did. And a guard grabbed me, and the teacher came back and was yelling at me. And I kept saying, but I thought I saw Dag Hammarskjold. I just wanted to see Dag Hammarskjold. I don\u2019t know. I was probably seven or eight years old when I went. And the UN was, like, a huge thing. It still \u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t done a spectacular job, you have to admit.", "kara swisher", "Yeah.", "fran lebowitz", "I still love walking past it. I still love looking at it. E.B. White wrote a fantastic thing about the UN, and no one thinks about it anymore, I\u2019m aware of that. But I do.", "kara swisher", "What do you like about it?", "fran lebowitz", "I mean, when we went to the UN, one of the things they told us, they took us into the General Assembly, and they told us \u2014 there were all these people with headphones, which was not a thing you saw then. That in itself was like walking into a rocket ship in the \u201850s. And they said these people are simultaneously translating. People would give a speech in one language, and then someone would translate it into 50 other languages. Now Netflix has taken that over. OK? Now Netflix, when they put something out, they translate it. But I don\u2019t think Netflix is really the right replacement for the UN.", "kara swisher", "Getting back to Netflix, the \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City\u201c, you said people described it to you as a love letter to New York. But it\u2019s really a lot about a complex love relationship with New York.", "fran lebowitz", "I think that people complain and I complain. But truthfully, I wouldn\u2019t bother to complain this much about something I did not love. If I don\u2019t like something, I don\u2019t complain about it. I just don\u2019t think about it.", "kara swisher", "Yeah.", "fran lebowitz", "Believe me, I am not alone among New Yorkers to complain about New York. Every single New Yorker complains about New York. The reason that it angers me so much when things are wrong here is because this is New York! Fix it.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, the reason it\u2019s called \u201cPretend It\u2019s a City\u201d is because you get behind people when they are in your way, tourists, and say, \u201cPretend it\u2019s a city.\u201d", "fran lebowitz", "Yes, because the reason this initially came out of my mouth 15 years ago, whenever it was, was because it seemed to me that this behavior in the streets of New York was new at the time. In other words, for decades, the New York streets were always packed, and there was this unsaid idea that as people walked down the sidewalk, people walking toward them, everyone would swerve a little bit. This is why there weren\u2019t 1 billion collisions in the street every minute. So, at a certain point, people stopped doing that. And so that it became up to you, meaning me, to be the only person who moved to let another person past. And this, of course, enraged me. Now, this was partially just tourists. They\u2019re not going anywhere. They\u2019re not on their way somewhere. And partially \u2014 and that became worse when there were phones.", "kara swisher", "So you know what I do? I actually go up behind people when they\u2019re on their phones \u2014 I do this in San Francisco, which is prevalent everywhere now \u2014 and I get up really close behind someone, or if they\u2019re in front of me on their phones, heading towards me, I scream, \u201cPut it down.\u201d And typically, they apologize because they know they\u2019re bad. They know they\u2019re behaving badly in the streets.", "fran lebowitz", "Well, that\u2019s just one of the many differences between San Francisco and New York.", "kara swisher", "That I can yell at them, \u201cPut it down,\u201d and I don\u2019t get attacked? I do it in New York, too.", "fran lebowitz", "No, that people apologize. No one apologizes here. [MUSIC PLAYING]", "kara swisher", "We\u2019ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview and want to hear others, hit Subscribe. You\u2019ll be able to catch up on \u201cSway\u201d episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with comedian Sarah Cooper, and you\u2019ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Fran Lebowitz after the break. Also in the Netflix series, you talk about observing Charles Mingus, how he interacted with Duke Ellington. You said he had a violent temper, and but you also say Duke Ellington is the only person I saw Charles Mingus defer to. You said that everyone has someone like that in their lives, no matter how great they may be. Who is that person for you, or who was?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I would say that the person in my life whose opinion I \u2014 not just opinion, whose advice and opinion I sought, I mean, always, and who I really listened to, not just kind of vaguely ask them, was Toni Morrison. My relationship with Toni was very long, and it was a very intimate friendship. And she was quite a bit older than I am, or was. I mean, she\u2019s dead, obviously. But also because I\u2019ve known a lot of very smart people in my life, but I\u2019ve known only one wise person, and that was Toni. So Toni changed my mind or shattered an assumption in a second. Toni loved crime novels and that kind of stuff in trials. And I was watching a trial with her or talking about some trial of some crime, and I said to her \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what we were talking about. But I said, well, but don\u2019t you think that most people in jail are guilty? And she looked at me like I was a moron and said no, I don\u2019t think most people in jail are guilty. And that was the first time that I ever considered that maybe enough people in jail are not guilty for it to be a severe central problem in the country. I never thought about that. Because, of course, I had no contact with the criminal justice system.", "kara swisher", "Mm-hmm. What was the last conversation you had with her?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, the last year of Toni\u2019s life, she was really not well. She was really not well, and she was in the country. She had a house in the country. We\u2019d go up and see her there. But the main thing I tried to do when I would go visit her was egg at her to come to New York, where I thought she would be better served medically, and to get her to turn off MSNBC, which she was watching 24 hours a day. And I would say, please, Toni \u2014", "kara swisher", "Why?", "fran lebowitz", "\u2014just turn this off. Why did I try to get her to turn it off?", "kara swisher", "Yeah.", "fran lebowitz", "Because to pay this attention to politics while Donald Trump is the president was too stressful for people. I thought it was too stressful. I said, Toni, you should not be so stressed. You don\u2019t have to stay on top of this 24 hours a day. Please stop watching this. But she just couldn\u2019t. She was, like, addicted to it.", "kara swisher", "Did you spend a lot of time watching it? Did you spend a lot of time being stressed about Donald Trump?", "fran lebowitz", "I spent, like most people I know, five years of my life where I did not have a day I didn\u2019t have to think about Donald Trump. And it was like he was like an occupying army in your mind. And among all the things that he did, I resented this tremendously. And I have to tell you that I hardly think of him now because I do not have to. Because although he still exists in the world and although people keep talking about him, he doesn\u2019t have the power anymore. So I don\u2019t care what he says. I never cared what he said before he was the president, and I don\u2019t care what he says now.", "kara swisher", "All right, he\u2019s also a New Yorker, so let\u2019s talk about New York City. Or do you not consider him a New Yorker anymore?", "fran lebowitz", "I never thought of him as a New Yorker.", "kara swisher", "Why?", "fran lebowitz", "I never thought of him as a New Yorker. Even though I know he lived in New York, I know he\u2019s from New York, I never thought of him as a New Yorker, because he had really a kind of tourist idea of New York. Even the first time I even heard of Donald Trump was when he knocked down Bonwit Teller to build that piece of junk that is there now, whatever it\u2019s called, the Trump Tower. And that\u2019s the first time I ever heard of him. And people that I knew, including myself, were appalled because there were these friezes on top of Bonwit Teller, and some organization asked him to take them off the building. He was outraged by this. He said, what are you talking about? It\u2019s my building, I own it. So he had no concept of it is a building that is on 57th and Fifth Avenue that millions of people look at. And New Yorkers, one thing that really distinguished the New Yorkers is the idea that we own things we don\u2019t even rent. So it\u2019s our view of that building and takes them off and preserve them, and he promised to and then he didn\u2019t because he discovered what anyone would know, that it\u2019s cheaper to just bang the building down than to take something carefully off the building.", "kara swisher", "How has New York changed for you during the pandemic?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, it\u2019s changed, I would say, profoundly, mainly because what I think of and most people think of as urban life stopped. I mean, it\u2019s not totally closed down, and it\u2019s less closed down than it was. But the main thing that I miss that I didn\u2019t even know existed in my life was the number of people that I think of as people that are, I\u2019m friends with, not close friends, that I routinely saw all the time that I stopped seeing because I was just running into them. So happenstance is gone for me, and for, I\u2019m sure, most people here. You don\u2019t run into people because you\u2019re not in restaurants. You\u2019re not at parties. You\u2019re not in museums. You\u2019re not at galleries. You\u2019re not in movies. You\u2019re not seeing them. And that is something that will not come back until every person gets the vaccine, which I cannot stress enough to get a vaccine if you can get one.", "kara swisher", "Did you get one? Have you gotten yours?", "fran lebowitz", "I got the first one. I did. I got my first one.", "kara swisher", "What have you changed in adapting to the COVID times? What has changed in your life? Obviously not going to parties and restaurants, but what else?", "fran lebowitz", "Everything. I mean everything I could think of. I mean, I suppose that I\u2019m most looking forward to is not having to wear a mask, which everyone hates. And this is a new thing that came up during the pandemic that would make me angry. You see some people not wearing masks. In New York, there\u2019s a lot of compliance with mask wearing, but it\u2019s not total, and it\u2019s less than it was. And I would think to myself, put on a mask. What\u2019s wrong with you? Oh, you don\u2019t like to wear it? No one does. Everyone hates them. Who would possibly like them? They\u2019re horrible. And for me, I put the mask on. As soon as you put the mask on, you can\u2019t breathe. That\u2019s everyone. I wear eyeglasses so the second I put the mask on, I can\u2019t see, because the glasses get fogged up. Then, totally having nothing to do with reality, but some psychological problem, the second I put it on, I can\u2019t hear. I know there\u2019s no reason for this, but this is what happens to me. So basically, I\u2019m walking around town. I\u2019m Helen Keller, but without the courage. So I\u2019m dying to take the mask off, believe me.", "kara swisher", "You can still hear, apparently. Correct? Not on this phone call, but you can still hear.", "fran lebowitz", "I can hear, but it does \u2014 I feel, obviously \u2014 I mean, the not being able to hear, which I noticed right away, and I know there\u2019s no reason for it, is obviously psychological. And it\u2019s because I feel so isolated with the mask on.", "kara swisher", "Right, 100%. So my son is a freshman at N.Y.U, and he loves New York. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s a New Yorker from day one, even though he didn\u2019t grow up there. He grew up in San Francisco. He asked me to ask you a question. He said New York has changed so much over the years. Which part of it, if any, has stayed true from your perspective?", "fran lebowitz", "You know, I\u2019m certain since your son is a freshman at N.Y.U that he\u2019s a very young kid. New York changes all the time. It just doesn\u2019t usually change all at once so completely. So that if your son is here for six months, I guarantee you, he\u2019s going to notice things changed. To me, someone said to me, what\u2019s a real New Yorker? How long do you have to live in New York to be a real New Yorker? I said it could be a week. As soon as you start complaining that something is gone that you already saw, you\u2019re a New Yorker. So there\u2019s not a square foot of this city that is the same as when I came here. And that has been true for decades. But what I always say is no one can help where they\u2019re from. You can only help where you went. So if you come to New York, you\u2019re a New Yorker. Welcome.", "kara swisher", "What would it take you to leave New York? Is there anything that would make you leave New York?", "fran lebowitz", "Apparently not. I mean, it didn\u2019t even occur to me to leave. I didn\u2019t even think about it. I mean, I do not have another house, so obviously, I didn\u2019t go to my other house I don\u2019t have. But I have numerous friends who have other houses, and right away, they went to these other houses. They invited me. And I thought, well, it\u2019s true that your house is nicer than any house I have. It is also true that you have what I really wish I would had, which is a cook, because I hate to cook. But it is also true that I do not feel like being a good guest. So I\u2019d rather stay here and be a bad guest in my own apartment. And believe me, I have been.", "kara swisher", "All right, so on that note, you mused in the documentary about running for night mayor, a job of New York. You could split it into shifts. I want to ask you about the new mayor\u2019s race. And I\u2019d love to get very quickly your take on the various people running for mayor. There\u2019s about 30 candidates right now running. Andrew Yang is leading in some polls. Does he have your endorsement, or what do you think of him?", "fran lebowitz", "I cannot think of a more ridiculous idea. Well, I probably could. But first of all, I never heard of this guy until he ran for president. He has one idea that\u2019s, in itself, nothing, meaningless, if you don\u2019t connect it to a million complicated things. He\u2019s not qualified to be the president. He\u2019s not qualified to be the mayor of New York. I think these bored rich people should do something else, get another hobby. Stop bothering us.", "kara swisher", "Like what?", "fran lebowitz", "I don\u2019t care what he does. Go skiing, buy a sail boat \u2014 I don\u2019t care.", "kara swisher", "All right. What about Eric Adams, the former police officer and borough president of Brooklyn?", "fran lebowitz", "I always liked Eric Adams. He was a cop, as you mentioned. He also started an organization within the police I think called Black Officers in Law Enforcement \u2014 I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the correct title. I\u2019m sure someone will correct me. He\u2019s good. He\u2019s smart. Because he was a cop and because he focuses on this one thing, this is an important thing in New York, but it\u2019s not the only thing in New York. And I just think it\u2019s too limited a take on New York.", "kara swisher", "All right, Maya Wiley, a former lawyer to de Blasio, one of your favorites.", "fran lebowitz", "I kind of like her. I only know her from \u2014 she\u2019s on television a lot here. She\u2019s very smart. At first, I really liked her. Then I found out she worked for de Blasio, then I didn\u2019t like her. Then I thought, well, maybe it\u2019s not her fault she worked for de Blasio. I mean, you don\u2019t always have your total choice of jobs. I would love there to be a woman mayor. There\u2019s never been a woman mayor in New York.", "kara swisher", "Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller.", "fran lebowitz", "Scott Stringer is someone I slightly know. He\u2019s actually qualified to be the mayor of New York. He\u2019s certainly financially astute, and that is something in New York, there\u2019s really no money here. There\u2019s no money in the country. Anything you see that looks like there\u2019s economic activity in the country is a kind of a stage set. It can be pulled down in one minute. And so there\u2019s going to be massive financial problems here. And so I think Scott Stringer would be good at that. Unfortunately, Scott Stringer as a physical presence is really not the sort of person that gets elected. I mean, he is not a terribly charismatic figure. I don\u2019t think Scott Stringer could win, frankly.", "kara swisher", "What about Ray McGuire, the former Citigroup executive?", "fran lebowitz", "I don\u2019t know him at all. A number of people have started talking to me about him a few months ago. The only thing I know about him is that he was a banker. And so, that\u2019s not my first choice. I don\u2019t really know about him.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, do you have a name who should run? Do you want Rudy Giuliani back? I\u2019m teasing you there.", "fran lebowitz", "Oh, yeah. Rudy Giuliani is not the mayor. He may soon not be a lawyer. And he may and should be what Donald Trump is going to become, which is simply the defendant.", "kara swisher", "Yeah. The reason I\u2019m asking about New York is I may have to move to New York. My wife, we live in Washington now for my kids. But we may move there, so I have very big concerns of who\u2019s running New York and bringing New York back. And I want to get a tiny bit about your personal life. We have very different journeys, I think. I have a lot of kids. I\u2019ve been married. I\u2019ve been gay married twice. You\u2019ve said you\u2019ve been a terrible romantic partner. Have you ever gotten close to getting married?", "fran lebowitz", "[LAUGHS] Absolutely not. I mean close to getting married. I am a terrible \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of the nicest way to say it about myself. I\u2019m great at romance, and I\u2019m terrible at relationships. I\u2019m terrible at them. I\u2019m really bad at them. I don\u2019t want them. I\u2019m not good at them. I loathe domestic life. I have lived by myself my entire life. And you have to admit, that\u2019s an incredible accomplishment for a lesbian.", "kara swisher", "It is. Incredible, incredible.", "fran lebowitz", "I just, I don\u2019t have the patience. I\u2019m just not \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m not a good enough person for it. I don\u2019t want to share my life to that extent. I never have. It just doesn\u2019t interest me. I don\u2019t care what other people do. I must say that when I was \u2014 I mean, in the last many years, very often, kids stopped me and say, thank you, Fran, for fighting for gay marriage. We really appreciate it. And it\u2019s like, I never fought for gay marriage. And let me tell you something. I never even thought \u2014 that phrase didn\u2019t even exist when I was young. It would have been just a joke phrase. So I was very surprised that people who were politically active in gay rights things, which I was not, that the first two things they chose and succeeded at was marriage and joining the military.", "kara swisher", "Right, I wanted to do both. I got married, and I wanted to join the military, just so you know. And I have 100 kids.", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I mean, it\u2019s not that I thought that people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to join the military. It\u2019s just that someone I know, a very rich man who gave a lot of money to the fight for being able to join the military, who is old enough to have been drafted during Vietnam, I said, how did you get out of going to Vietnam? And he said, I told them I was gay.", "kara swisher", "OK, [LAUGHS] OK.", "fran lebowitz", "And very few people did that, by the way. I mean very few people. Gay people did that because once you said that, you also were never going to get a job. So I was very surprised that all these gay people wanted to join the military. Anyone who wants to join the military, I certainly think you should be allowed to. If you want to get married, I certainly think you should be allowed to. But not me.", "kara swisher", "OK, who\u2019s the most famous person you dated?", "fran lebowitz", "I would never say that.", "kara swisher", "Come on, Fran.", "fran lebowitz", "Yeah, I haven\u2019t said this my whole life, but I was waiting to say it to The New York Times. I\u2019m not saying it.", "kara swisher", "Why not? It\u2019s only a small newspaper in New York.", "fran lebowitz", "Because I\u2019m a private person.", "kara swisher", "All right, OK. You say you never get lonely and that staying around someone too long is worse than being alone. I wonder if you\u2019ve ever felt fearful about being alone.", "fran lebowitz", "I think that what I probably said was that I\u2019ve never been lonely in my life, really. I mean, I\u2019ve missed certain people, which is, to me, not the same thing as have a general loneliness. There\u2019s certainly people I missed in my life, and there\u2019s certain people I continue to miss. But I just never felt lonely in the way of general loneliness. I\u2019ve also never been bored unless I was with other people. So that may be the reason.", "kara swisher", "So what do you actually do all day?", "fran lebowitz", "My days really vary. I don\u2019t have a typical day. I have to say, I never have. One of the things I discovered during the pandemic is that certain things you wish for your entire life occurred, but you didn\u2019t mean that. In other words, I\u2019ve always said, I wish that all I had to do was lie on the sofa and read. Oh, no, I didn\u2019t mean this way. I walked into Times Square at the height of the lockdown. It was completely empty. And I stood there, and I thought, you\u2019ve been hoping for 30 years that the tourists would leave the Times Square, but I didn\u2019t mean this.", "kara swisher", "Did you think about working on your books during the pandemic?", "fran lebowitz", "I didn\u2019t think about it as much as other people did.", "kara swisher", "Mm-hmm. OK, you\u2019re the key part.", "fran lebowitz", "I\u2019m aware I should be doing it. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m unaware. I\u2019m exactly as aware as when I didn\u2019t do my homework in school.", "kara swisher", "Right, right. Well, you joke about having writer\u2019s blockade. Do you want to finish these books, or are they \u2014 there\u2019s a reason you can\u2019t declare them officially dead and just move along?", "fran lebowitz", "Well, I still have both of them. I mean, \u201cExterior Signs of Wealth\u201d is about half finished, and \u201cProgress\u201d is also about half finished. I did at one point suggest to my publisher, to whom, as you can imagine, I\u2019ve had many of these conversations with whom. I said, well, I\u2019ve half of one book and half of the other. You can maybe put them together, and then they could turn it around. They would make no sense, but maybe people don\u2019t care. So the fact that I still own these things \u2014 I mean, I still have them physically \u2014 must mean that somewhere, I imagine I might finish them.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, and you don\u2019t want to just let them go. Let them go. Goodbye.", "fran lebowitz", "No. I mean, it\u2019s highly possible that whoever goes through my things after my death will find them in the exact same states they\u2019re in now, but I hope that\u2019s not the case.", "kara swisher", "All right, I did ask Twitter for some questions. I\u2019m going to go through them. And these are from actual Twitter people, who are huge fans of Fran Lebowitz.", "fran lebowitz", "OK.", "kara swisher", "OK? Any New Year\u2019s resolutions?", "fran lebowitz", "No, I never make New Year\u2019s resolutions. Never. I\u2019ve never done it in my life. I think it\u2019s in social studies, I did once write something called New Year\u2019s Resolutions for Others, tell other people what to do.", "kara swisher", "If you could pick one moment critical to New York City history to witness or witness again, which would it be?", "fran lebowitz", "Wow, I have never been asked that, and that\u2019s unusual. I don\u2019t know since I never thought that I could pick one moment in the New York history to witness again. I wish I had an answer to that question, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019ve never thought about it.", "kara swisher", "OK, anything?", "fran lebowitz", "It would not be this minute, I\u2019ll tell you that.", "kara swisher", "OK, all right, that\u2019s a good answer. You\u2019re always seen wearing the same thing. But I would want to ask you about the cowboy boots. Do you own any more formal footwear? What about sneakers and comfortable shoes?", "fran lebowitz", "I own Manolo Blahnik shoes that I wear or wore when I got more dressed up, which I haven\u2019t done in a year, when I wear a suit or a dinner jacket. They are, like, 95 feet high. All my clothes that I had made, the pants are cut to them. So they\u2019re incredibly uncomfortable, but they make me look very tall, which is something that if you\u2019re not tall, is something that you wish you were.", "kara swisher", "All right, how can you detest people, yet love parties?", "fran lebowitz", "I don\u2019t detest people. That\u2019s just not true about me. I mean, I realize people think that. I don\u2019t detest people. I am a kind of a split personality. I am alternately extremely sociable. And then when I\u2019m not sociable, by which I mean when I\u2019m not at social events or in public social life, in my domestic life, I\u2019m solitary.", "kara swisher", "All right, well, we\u2019ll leave it at that. Now Fran, how are you going to listen to this podcast without a computer or a smartphone?", "fran lebowitz", "I\u2019m not going to listen to it.", "kara swisher", "I thought so. I thought that was the answer. I really appreciate you doing this.", "fran lebowitz", "It\u2019s a pleasure, but could someone tell me how to shut this off? Could you just tell me which button on the right side? Hold where I pushed it. Don\u2019t leave before I do this. Oh, it worked. It\u2019s off.", "kara swisher", "Yay.", "fran lebowitz", "I feel so accomplished.", "kara swisher", "You know what? We\u2019re going to enroll you at MIT now.", "fran lebowitz", "Yeah\u2014 what do you mean enroll? I should be graduating.", "kara swisher", "[LAUGHS] That\u2019s true.
