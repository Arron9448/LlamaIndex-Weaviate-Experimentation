I woke up this morning and saw that my ethnicity was trending on Twitter\u2014something must have happened.", "People usually talk at me, near me, over me, against me\u2014pretty much every preposition except after I\u2019m finished talking. But I mostly tune them out and think about what eucalyptus smells like, because I\u2019m not sure that I really know. I\u2019ve smelled it dozens of times, but I couldn\u2019t describe it to you. What\u2019s up with that?", "Now everyone is tweeting about how my \u201cvoice needs to be heard,\u201d and how my \u201cstory needs to be shared.\u201d Well, I do have a story about how I demolished my competition at the Bloomington Annual Hot-Dog-Eating Contest after training for two months straight, but I feel like that doesn\u2019t match the tragedy vibe I\u2019m starting to pick up on.", "Three white acquaintances, including my former co-worker Josh, who still hasn\u2019t returned a book I loaned him in 2013, texted me, \u201cSorry to hear about what happened, hope you\u2019re holding up!,\u201d so I know that I am about to be dealt a real blow. (Also, what the hell, Josh, how long does it take to finish \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d? We literally all read it in middle school and it\u2019s twelve pages.)", "Not only Gushers but also Fruit by the Foot has released a company-wide statement about my race. Some shit must be going down!", "Whatever it is has got to be pretty bad, because my roommate ran up to me and asked me if I needed anything. I told her, \u201cYeah, those quiches from Trader Joe\u2019s,\u201d like I\u2019d said the last three times she went grocery shopping but then conveniently forgot.", "She hugged me and cried a little, but there\u2019s no way that was because of how bad she felt about repeatedly forgetting quiche. Something else must have happened, like the President dissing the country I\u2019m from or something.", "O.K. maybe my gender and race came up in a CNN breaking-news alert for a positive reason? Like, maybe a woman of color received some sort of honor? Perhaps she was the first to have her photograph on a magazine cover, or the first to win a Nascar race, or the first to be elected mayor of some old racist town?", "God, I remember when that C-list celebrity was the first bisexual woman of color to be on the Food Network and everyone asked me about it for weeks. And then I had to tell them all that the only network I care about is \u201cCartoon.\u201d", "Well, if someone who slightly resembles me did do something great, that means I\u2019m going to have to talk to people all week about why I think there aren\u2019t more people like me represented in the industry. Jesus Christ, I was going to have an \u201cArrested Development\u201d marathon and maybe go roller skating, but now I\u2019ve got to think about whatever this is about.", "Oh, no\u2014I have tons of tags and D.M.s on Facebook and Instagram. And there\u2019s no way these are in response to the extreme but accurate opinion that I posted about how the \u201cCars\u201d franchise is a blight on an otherwise perfect Pixar filmography, and how those movies\u2019 writers should be in jail.", "No, something more sinister must have happened, like nobody of my race got nominated for one of those awards shows and now it\u2019s a whole thing. Or maybe Netflix just put out another documentary about a historical event that happened to my people that white people are just learning about?", "This is getting worse! A journalist from a major publication just asked me to write a guest column on my thoughts and feelings \u201cabout all this.\u201d Whenever people refer vaguely to \u201ceverything that\u2019s going on right now,\u201d it\u2019s never good\u2014it\u2019s got to be because someone was racially profiled or harassed or had an op-ed written about them in which their rights and humanity were debated as if they were a topic in Model U.N.", "Guess I\u2019d better bite the bullet and check the news.", "Oh, fuck. My boss just e-mailed me and wants to promote me. Someone who looks like me definitely got attacked. This is America\u2014that\u2019s probably what it is."], "authors": ["Meghana Indurti", "Meghana Indurt", "Ronald Metellus", "Skyler Higle", "Ginny Hoga"], "keywords": ["person", "asked", "think", "race", "maybe", "bad", "woman", "im", "way", "interested", "mesomething", "going", "color", "happened", "white", "suddenly"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
