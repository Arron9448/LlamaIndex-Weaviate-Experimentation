The couple met when he was a guest on her daytime talk show The Real. \u201cYears later, he asked me out on a date,\u201d Jeannie remembers. \u201cWe shared a romantic sushi dinner in Los Angeles and salsa danced the night away. Later that evening, he asked if I could picture spending the rest of my life with him. And crazy enough, I could.\u201d", "In March 2020, the couple was forced to cancel a planned trip to Vietnam, where unbeknownst to Jeannie, Jeezy had planned to propose. Instead, he put together a special quarantine Vietnam-themed date night, in honor of her home country, at his house in Los Angeles that ended with him popping the question in front of the fireplace. She said, \u201cYes!\u201d", "The couple wanted to get married at Lake Como or in the South of France. \u201cWe were really looking forward to having all of our friends and family there to celebrate,\u201d Jeannie says. \u201cBut we had to change all of our wedding plans due to COVID. After Jeezy\u2019s mother unexpectedly passed, we quickly learned that life is too short. And at the end of the day, Jeezy and I really just wanted to become husband and wife. So we decided to turn our original wedding into a mini-mony, where we exchanged our vows in front of our immediate family and a few close friends.\u201d", "In order to make their event as safe as possible for everyone in attendance, they required negative COVID-19 test results from those traveling in two days prior to the wedding. In addition to that, on the day of the ceremony, they provided COVID-19 tests for everyone attending. \u201cOnce everyone was tested and confirmed negative, our guests were shuttled to the surprise location\u2014our home,\u201d Jeannie says.", "The couple worked with Suzanne Reinhard to plan everything. \u201cShe followed through with our details exactly as requested and minimized any stress,\u201d Jeannie notes. \u201cShe made it so enjoyable!\u201d", "Jeannie always knew she wanted to wear a dress by Galia Lahav, and conceptualizing the look was one of her favorite parts of the wedding planning process. \u201cI collaborated with my stylist Lisa Cera and the Galia Lahav atelier to custom design the layers and the perfect hue,\u201d Jeannie says. \u201cThe finished product was everything I envisioned.\u201d", "Cera searched high and low for matching nude appliqu\u00e9s and hand-placed them on the dress for an especially unique design. \u201cFor hair and makeup, I wanted a sleek and graceful finish, along with a bit of drama,\u201d Jeannie says, \u201cso Lisa and I worked on a handmade headpiece with a 15-foot Galia Lahav veil. My hairstylist, Kristen, impressively sewed this into my hair.\u201d Jewelry was kept minimal, and the bride\u2019s friend Rosalina Lydster created diamond and morganite drop earrings that tied everything together.", "Jeezy also wanted a custom design for the wedding day, so he called upon his favorite tailor, Teofilo Flor, and stylist Kris Shelby to create a champagne blush suit that projected strength and sophistication but with a bit of playfulness too. Meanwhile, guests were asked to wear off-white, a color that, to the couple, represents the peace in their union.", "The service took place in the open garden at the couple\u2019s home against a backdrop of magnolia, birch, and maple trees\u2014a setting that was both intimate and familial. \u201cEverywhere you went, there were tall glass candles lighting your path,\u201d Jeannie says. \u201cAnd, we had a live band, Trap Jazz, perform our favorite songs.\u201d", "As guests arrived, cell phones were checked at the door before everyone descended downstairs towards the open garden.", "After each family member proceeded down the aisle, the father of the groom laid a single pink rose on a seat reserved for the late Sharon Denise Jenkins, Jeezy\u2019s mother. Author and pastor John Maxwell waited at the altar as Jeezy made his way down the aisle to \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Loving You\u201d by Kem. The bride followed afterwards to \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love\u201d by the Bee Gees. Then, Jeannie\u2019s brother kicked things off with a twist on tradition\u2014the Vietnamese tea ceremony. \u201cHe led Jeezy and I in a ritual performed at Vietnamese weddings,\u201d Jeannie remembers. \u201cIn this ceremony, we honored our parents by pouring tea as a gesture to welcome Jeezy into my family, and me into his. Then we paid our respects to our parents and ancestors by bowing four times, each one symbolizing a significant gift in the life that they have provided us with.\u201d", "Following the tea ceremony, the couple exchanged vows of commitment and then sealed it all with a kiss. Afterwards, Jeezy surprised Jeannie by having Tyrese serenade them for their first dance to \u201cSweet Lady.\u201d \u201cThe entire night was filled with speeches and funny memories from all our guests,\u201d the bride says. \u201cNot to be outdone, my mother, Mama Mai, kicked off the after-party with a special performance of her own.\u201d", "To continue the celebration, the group ultimately moved the after-party into the couple\u2019s lounge, where guests were gifted custom monogrammed Cozy Earth pajamas and slippers. \u201cJeezy and I changed into our own special matching Versace silk pajamas,\u201d Jeannie says. \u201cAnd then we danced the night away to our favorite hits, feeling cozier than ever.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Macon", "Alexandra Maco"], "keywords": ["intimate", "favorite", "inside", "ceremony", "jeezy", "mais", "wedding", "wanted", "couple", "jeannie", "night", "atlanta", "family", "guests"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
