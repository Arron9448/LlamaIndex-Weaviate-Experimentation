Putting a pause on the booze is a very simple first step, but you can quickly discover that your options are limited to juice, squash and cola. Instead, try some of these complex and sophisticated non-alcoholic cocktail ideas. Just whatever you do, don\u2019t call them mocktails. You\u2019re an adult, for crying out loud.", "Switchel", "Fiona Beckett has been writing for this paper for more than two decades now, so when she suggests knocking up something called Switchel \u2013 a sweet, spicy, sour blend of ginger, cider vinegar, lemon juice and maple syrup, diluted with sparkling water \u2013 you should probably take her seriously. Beckett says that a Switchel is \u201cmuch more enjoyable than drinking cider vinegar on its own\u201d, although quite frankly what isn\u2019t?", "Donkey Crunch", "Cleaned-up Moscow Mule ... the Donkey Crunch. Photograph: Johanna Parkin (commissioned)", "If you\u2019re looking for something with the same warming ginger hit \u2013 but without the puckering effects of literal vinegar \u2013 then Meatliquor\u2019s Donkey Crunch sounds like your best bet. Consisting of lime juice, ginger syrup (sugar syrup infused with ginger, obviously) and ginger beer, it\u2019s essentially a cleaned-up Moscow Mule. The recipe also suggests adding vodka and absinthe, although that wouldn\u2019t be in the spirit of this list and you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking about it.", "Pineapple and kaffir lime crush", "Tucked away in a 2017 Kate Hawkings cocktail list, you\u2019ll find a recipe for a pineapple and kaffir lime crush, which should provide enough of a sunshiney blast to blow away the long dark January evenings. You\u2019ll need a whole pineapple, peeled and bashed about in a jug with some kaffir lime leaves and sugar, before mixing it down with some cold ginger ale. Tremendous.", "Thyme Fizz", "You may have noticed that we are now three for three when it comes to ginger. Just in case you\u2019re worried that this entire article has been furtively sponsored by big ginger, allow me to shift direction. Jack Adair Bevan has a very simple recipe for a drink called Thyme Fizz. It\u2019s honey syrup, sparkling water, lemon and \u2013 yes, that\u2019s right \u2013 thyme. \u201cIf you\u2019d prefer it a little less holier than thou, add a good glug of gin,\u201d says Bevan. But don\u2019t do that, because it would undermine the entire pointof it being booze-free.", "Non-alcoholic old fashioned", "The non-alcoholic old fashioned. Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian", "This January isn\u2019t like other Januaries, for reasons you don\u2019t need to be reminded of. If you happen to be at home with more time on your hands than you\u2019d like, perhaps you need a project \u2013 and Sam Dagger\u2019s non-alcoholic old fashioned is just that. To make it, you\u2019ll first need to assemble a decently complicated premix. You\u2019ll also need hops, cayenne pepper, cloves, cinnamon sticks, orange peel, tea, sugar and two types of bitters. Done right, sourcing and making this could kill an entire afternoon.", "Gin-free G&T", "And now for Miriam Nice\u2019s recipe for gin-free G&T, which is not, as you might have expected, just some tonic water in a glass. Instead, this is a very convincing attempt to mimic the botanical hit of gin, with cardamom, cucumber, rosemary, cloves, mint leaves, lemon zest and chamomile tea. This needs to be mixed together and left in the fridge to infuse for four hours. Alternatively, just drink some tonic water.", "Virgin mojito", "Hold the rum ... virgin mojito. Photograph: Profimedia/Alamy", "Now, let\u2019s say you bought all the ingredients for the previous recipe and now you have a shedload of mint leaves with nowhere to go. If that\u2019s the case, let me introduce you to Olive magazine\u2019s virgin mojito. Muddle the leaves, a lime and some sugar, add some apple juice and almond extract, and you, too, can party like it\u2019s 2008.", "Non-alcoholic dirty martini", "This is all very well, but what if you happen to have an unmanageable glut of potato water in your house? If that\u2019s the case \u2013 and I suspect it is \u2013 then why not try making This Vivacious Life\u2019s non-alcoholic dirty martini? Put the water you cooked the potatoes in into a cocktail shaker, add olive juice and drink. What makes this martini so dirty? Probably the potatoes, in all honesty.", "Hot Buttered Pineapple", "If you wanted something warmer and less potatoey, The Purple Pumpkin has a recipe for something called Hot Buttered Pineapple. It\u2019s made with pineapple juice, orange juice, cinnamon, brown sugar and butter, slung in a pan and simmered for 20 minutes. As such it\u2019s deeply comforting and probably quite close to what Lilt would taste like if you left it next to a radiator for too long.", "Basically a Salad", "Finally, if you\u2019ve decided to ditch booze for health reasons, here\u2019s a nice way to double up. Imbibe magazine has a recipe for a cocktail called Basically a Salad: carrot juice, orange juice, lime juice and turmeric syrup in a glass. The magazine says the cocktail got its name thanks to its \u201ccrisp, earthy flavour\u201d. If Gwyneth Paltrow hasn\u2019t sipped one of these while having her face exfoliated, I\u2019ll eat my hat."], "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "keywords": ["superdry", "ginger", "nonalcoholic", "buttered", "lime", "cocktail", "youll", "water", "need", "juice", "martini", "dirty", "cocktails", "syrup", "recipe", "sugar", "hot", "pineapple"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
