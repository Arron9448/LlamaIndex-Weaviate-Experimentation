After two days, it\u2019s like an alarm sounds inside me and sends me right back to 1999. I\u2019m a petulant teenager again with a bad attitude, and everything my mother says, no matter how innocuous, inspires the response, \u201cUgh, Mom, stop nagging me!\u201d", "This unstoppable regression, which has been going on since I left for college, felt worse once I became a parent myself. I am an extremely grown woman now, I thought. I am beyond this. But, like clockwork, by the third day of exposure to my mom and dad, I\u2019d be back in the \u201990s, scowling and blasting the Breeders in a borrowed Honda.", "I am far from alone in this. Psychologists even have a term to describe the way we fall back into predictable, maddening behavior patterns when we\u2019re with our family of origin. It\u2019s called family systems theory \u2014 the notion that families have an equilibrium, and each person has a fixed role that \u201cis in service of keeping the family system intact,\u201d said Pooja Lakshmin, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. So whatever your established role is \u2014 whether you\u2019re the appeaser, or the family clown, or the petulant one \u2014 you\u2019re going to be thrown right back there the second you walk through the door of your childhood home.", "Kira Birditt, Ph.D., a research associate professor at the University of Michigan who has studied tension between adult children and their parents, said that 94 percent of respondents in her study on the topic reported some kind of strife in their relationships. Research also shows that the connection between mothers and adult daughters is especially fraught; Dr. Birditt described it as \u201cthe closest and most irritating\u201d of almost all relationships. (One of the most life-changing episodes of my early adulthood was noticing my own mother get sulky at something her mother said.)", "So, how do you get through the holidays with your folks without losing your damn mind? Here\u2019s some sanity-preserving advice.", "Prepare for your inevitable regression. It\u2019s not a question of if the regression is going to happen, it\u2019s when. Dr. Lakshmin advised that you do some mental work before visiting your family so that you can avoid triggering your worst behaviors. Ask yourself: Are there particular topics of conversation or physical places that tend to send your family into a tizzy? And then try to avoid those topics and places. Even changing scenery can help jog you out of old patterns, so if the family dinner table always devolves into chaos, try going out to eat one night and see if it improves relations.", "Try to find empathy. The most typical negative mother-daughter interaction involves this dynamic: Adult daughters feel criticized by their mothers, and mothers feel their daughters are being too sensitive, said Deborah Tannen, Ph.D., a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and the author of \u201cYou\u2019re Wearing That? Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation.\u201d How the grandchildren are being raised is a major trigger for this dynamic, Dr. Tannen said: \u201cMany women told me that they could take criticism about anything except their mothering skills.\u201d", "Dr. Tannen\u2019s advice for grandparents: Bite your tongue, because even the most benign (to you) suggestion may be perceived as criticism. Her advice for adult daughters is, \u201ctry to remind yourself that it feels like criticism, but it is an expression of caring.\u201d Your mother just wants everything to go well for you, and she\u2019s trying to help (even if it makes you want to scream into a pillow).", "Make space for yourself. You will need an escape hatch from time to time. \u201cWhether this means hiding out in the bathroom for 10 minutes to cool down, structuring the length of visits or springing for a hotel rather than staying in your parents\u2019 guest room,\u201d make sure you\u2019re somehow creating a space where you can get some emotional distance from your family, said Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cThe Dance of Anger: A Woman\u2019s Guide to Changing the Patterns of Intimate Relationships.\u201d I always make sure I can exercise in the morning when I\u2019m with family \u2014 it gives me a break from them and also is a good conduit for ambient rage.", "Don\u2019t expect change. The last thing to remember is that there won\u2019t be a magical solution to your family trauma over the holidays, Dr. Lakshmin said. December is a stressful time \u2014 mental health professionals say it\u2019s particularly hard on their patients \u2014 and it\u2019s not the time to bring up old baggage and expect to work through it.", "P.S.
