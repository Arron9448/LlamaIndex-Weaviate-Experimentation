It said the most probable explanation was that the virus had jumped from animals to humans through an intermediate animal host. But the scientific search for a definitive answer will remain challenging because of geopolitical tensions and China\u2019s attempts at obfuscation.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Indeed, it does not recommend further research into that possibility. Numerous other geneticists and virology experts disagree, saying the lab-leak theory remains plausible. Commenting on the report, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO \u2019s director-general, said the possibility of a laboratory incident required \u201cfurther investigation\u201d.", "China has angrily denounced the laboratory-leak hypothesis as outright conspiracy-mongering. It will be as irritated by Dr Tedros\u2019s remarks as it was pleased with the report\u2019s strong downplaying of the possibility. China will be happy with the experts\u2019 call for further study into the (very low) possibility that the virus can survive on packaging and other surfaces in shipments of frozen food, and go on to infect people. This idea is one that China has been eagerly promoting. It wants its citizens to believe\u2014and the world at least to entertain the notion\u2014that the virus originated outside China, even though scientists see scant evidence of that.", "China\u2019s fixation on the frozen-food theory has prompted it to take extraordinary measures to prevent the reimportation of the virus by this means (covid-19 has been all but eliminated inside the country). It has required onerous inspections of cold-chain shipments. Officials have suspended the rights of hundreds of suppliers to send frozen products to China.", "Occasionally, officials report the discovery of SARS - C o V -2, the virus that causes covid-19, on frozen-food packaging. One such find, involving a beef product from Argentina, was made on March 28th at a warehouse in Tongliao, a city in the northern region of Inner Mongolia. It triggered an \u201cemergency response\u201d, with police and other officials mobilised to seal off the area, take people away for coronavirus tests and cleanse the site. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a lot of energy into this unlikely but possible hypothesis, trying to elevate it for obvious reasons,\u201d says Jamie Metzl, a former member of America\u2019s National Security Council and a genetics expert.", "The team\u2019s report will do little to dispel widespread suspicions that China is co-opting the investigation process for political purposes and failing to provide adequate transparency. Risking China\u2019s ire, Dr Tedros said the experts had faced difficulties in accessing raw data from their Chinese hosts. He insisted that future studies should \u201cinclude more timely and comprehensive data sharing\u201d. China, however, says it is being completely open. It also says the WHO should investigate whether the virus originated in America. As a new cold war develops, the fog is thickening. \u25a0", "Dig deeper", "All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub.
