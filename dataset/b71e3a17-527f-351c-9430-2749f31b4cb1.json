Nationalist propagandists have gone further, claiming that the Basques form an ancient and superior race, the first Europeans. In some versions they descend directly from the biblical Noah.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

The study, by a team at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and published in Current Biology, shows that Basques are indeed genetically different from their neighbours. But those differences seem to be relatively recent, dating from the end of the Iron Age (around 2,500 years ago). And they are greater in the core Basque-speaking areas than in the Basque periphery.", "A key finding is that Basques and other Spaniards all descend from the same Stone Age migrants from Europe\u2019s eastern steppes. The ancient Iberians, too, spoke a non-Indo-European language (like Basque, Finnish and Hungarian). The differences only began when the Romans turned up in Iberia. Recent research has found evidence that, contrary to myth, the Romans did conquer the Basque Country. But few seem to have settled in the core Basque-speaking areas. And the Arab-Berber invaders who occupied much of Iberia for seven centuries scarcely got there. Impenetrable mountains and an incomprehensible language discouraged genetic mingling, the researchers surmise.", "These findings should scotch the idea of a separate Basque race, as asserted by Sabino Arana, the founder of the Basque Nationalist Party ( PNV ). Arana was an anti-Semite who proclaimed the racial and religious purity of the Basques. When industrialisation brought a flood of migrants from the rest of the country, he warned against \u201cthe rubbing shoulders of our children with the children of the Spanish nation\u201d."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["spaniards", "basques", "different", "romans", "migrants", "basque", "race", "arent", "recent", "language", "nationalist", "genetically", "neighbours", "study"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
