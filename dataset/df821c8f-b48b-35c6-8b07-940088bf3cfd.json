It could have occurred during a job interview, for an online dating profile, or in a social-media quiz that matches your traits with a character from Game of Thrones. Or perhaps you\u2019ve endured a conversation with friends in which everyone is declared an \u201cintrovert\u201d or \u201cextrovert\u201d, the two tribes into which the entire world\u2019s population can seemingly be divided. \u200bThe dogma of personality classifications, says psychologist and author Dr Benjamin Hardy, is that they reveal \u201cyour true core authentic self \u2013 and that [once you have] discovered it, you can finally live your true life.\u201d They are supposed to be empowering and are presented as definitive. They work on the assumption that personality is a rigid thing, cast in plaster.", "Speaking over Zoom from his home in Florida, Hardy says all this is \u201cbogus\u201d. In his recent book Personality Isn\u2019t Permanent, he argues personality isn\u2019t fixed at all. Some shifts occur naturally as we go about our lives \u2013 but we can also consciously alter our traits should we so desire. He speaks about personality \u2013 \u201cyour consistent attitudes and behaviours, your way of showing up in situations\u201d \u2013 as a collection of learnable skills, like riding a bike.", "There is something unromantic and clinical about viewing traits as learned skills, because we tend to see our personality as key to what makes us us. Hardy thinks that\u2019s part of the problem. He says our \u201cidentity\u201d \u2013 how we choose to define ourself as a person \u2013 is what\u2019s important. Personality, which he views as \u201csurface level\u201d, is merely behaviour that stems from living out our identity. So you might see yourself as a powerful, charismatic man, and resulting traits might include confidence and a sharp sense of humour.", "It\u2019s a slightly hazy point, but the most important thing is the acknowledgment that we can change \u2013 both our identity and personality. This should be liberating. \u201cMost people have overly defined their current self. If you say \u201cI\u2019m an introvert\u201d, that\u2019s a label. And because most people\u2019s identity is a fixed mindset, their imagination and willingness to change is pretty stunted,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we can\u2019t change, it\u2019s that we don\u2019t believe we can.\u201d", "Personality Isn\u2019t Permanent is the latest addition to a growing body of psychology research upending the long-held assumption that personality is static. The realisation that it is malleable represents an intriguing addition to the lexicon of self-optimisation. In the past decade, the wellness movement has amplified interest in personal betterment. This has tended to focus on physical wellbeing (eating, sleeping and exercise) and on improving our mental state through practices like meditation. Although many of these overlap with personality \u2013 if you\u2019re well rested and exercising regularly, you are likely to be more upbeat \u2013 the explicit goal of improving personality traits has rarely surfaced.", "Could it be that, in the future, we strive to become funnier or kinder with the same intensity that currently goes into toning our abs? Might personality be the next thing to be sculpted and commodified in our quest to be ever-more-impressive people?", "Could we strive to be funnier or kinder as we do for better abs?", "The idea that personality becomes fixed at a certain age has endured for more than a century. The most accepted theory is that it solidifies by age 30 (as someone who\u2019s just celebrated that milestone, I find this thought alarming). This can be traced to William James, the late-19th-century professor whom Hardy calls the \u201cgodfather of American psychology\u201d, and is easily explained. Often \u201cyou\u2019ve set up a trajectory for yourself by age 30 \u2013 you\u2019ve settled into a career and family and stop doing so many \u2018first\u2019 things,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cWhereas if you\u2019re trying new things, your personality is going to keep changing because you\u2019re out of your comfort zone. I think people stop doing that as they age, not because they can\u2019t but because they\u2019ve put themselves on a track.\u201d", "Dr Wiebke Bleidorn, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, has another explanation for the \u201cpersonality is fixed\u201d doctrine. In the 1960s, psychologist Walter Mischel suggested personality wasn\u2019t real; it was merely a construct. Personality psychologists reacted by going out of their way to prove it did exist. \u201cThere was very little room for the idea that personality changes because we had to show that it\u2019s stable and predicts all kinds of outcomes,\u201d she says. \u201cSo then, as often, the pendulum swung a little too far.\u201d", "Now, psychologists are working to provide a more accurate, nuanced perspective. Their research shows that normative personality shifts will happen as we live our lives: attending school, moving out of home, and our first romantic relationships all have a significant impact (surprisingly, she says, having children does not). Growing older means traits such as self-control and conscientiousness heighten. Changing environments \u2013 workplaces; friendship groups \u2013 also have an effect.", "But what if we want to give the personality a tune-up \u2013 add some humour, subtract some meanness? Being specific about your intentions is important. \u201cYou must ask yourself: What is my personality right now? What would be my ideal personality? And what do I have to do to minimise the distance?\u201d says Bleidorn. She advises turning to psychotherapy. Even though we think of psychotherapy as addressing stress or relationship issues, she says \u201cat the end of the day it\u2019s often also a personality intervention. Because what people want is to change their patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviour \u2013 and that\u2019s our definition of personality.\u201d", "Try to envisage the person that you would like to become", "Hardy prefers to start with envisaging the person you would like to be \u2013 and says traits will follow. When I press him on altering specific traits, though, he says it comes down to \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d, a psychology term referring to a repetitive, highly self-aware process. \u201cYou must always be pushing slightly above your current skill level, getting feedback and some level of coaching. You watch and analyse yourself, just like a football player.\u201d If the target is to be outgoing, that might mean seeing a life coach, forcing yourself to go up to people at parties, or striking up conversation in caf\u00e9s. I say it sounds like learning anything else. He says it is. \u201cPersonality is a learnable skill, just like learning how to walk.\u201d", "If becoming more confident and outgoing is the goal, Nick Hatter could be your man. The London-based life coach uses techniques from fields including positive psychology, hypnosis and psychodynamics (figuring out unconscious motivations). When working on personality changes, he asks questions to help clients determine what motivates and triggers them. \u201cA lot of self-help books just dole out advice, but the problem with advice is it doesn\u2019t really give you that deeper level of self-awareness that will help you make different decisions,\u201d he says.", "Is there a cap on how much we can change our personality? Some experts think certain elements \u2013 such as the forces that motivate you \u2013 are set. But while Hardy admits some transformations will be more difficult, such as becoming sociable if you\u2019re cripplingly shy, he doesn\u2019t see any limits if you\u2019re willing to do the work.\u200b", "It sounds seductive on paper, but whether it\u2019s realistic is another matter. When I wonder aloud if this could be the next frontier for self-optimisation most experts suggest that\u2019s too big a claim, given the level of commitment and number of hours required to potentially alter traits. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people want to go that far; it\u2019s not easy,\u201d stresses Bleidorn.", "Yet a certain spike in interest seems inevitable. \u201cI think there definitely will be [an increase in personality improvement],\u201d says Hatter, adding that working on emotional intelligence is already becoming more popular in corporate settings. \u201cYou get a personal trainer for the gym, why not get one for your personality?\u201d", "Awareness that it\u2019s even an option will be the first step for many. \u201cWhen it comes to optimising yourself, you watch people online getting buff, and realise, \u2018OK, I can do that.\u2019 You think you can get ripped, but don\u2019t believe you can change your identity and your personality,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cPeople are going to realise, more and more, that they actually can \u2013 and then they\u2019ll do it.\u201d", "Personality Isn\u2019t Permanent by Benjamin Hardy is published by Portfolio at \u00a315.99.
