Or that most ancient medicinal texts, whether Chinese, Persian, or Greek, refer to vinegar (from the French vin aigre and the Latin vinum acetum, or soured wine) as a nostrum? Or that yeast, sugar, and bacteria exist in flower nectar, so that all fruits are, from the moment of their inception, on a natural path to becoming vinegar?", "I learned these facts from Oregon-\u200bbased vinegar maker Kirsten Shockey on Zoom while I noisily pureed Cortland apples into a slurry and stirred a jar full of old wine. I had an early copy of Shockey\u2019s upcoming book, Homebrewed Vinegar, a fold of cheesecloth, and several jars at my side. I\u2019d swept everything else to a corner of my kitchen\u2014my kimchi crock, my eight unopened sourdough books\u2014to make room for this next big microbiological obsession.", "You can\u2019t ignore that vinegar is having a moment. New York City\u2013based Pineapple Collaborative\u2019s The ACV, a cider vinegar made from heirloom-variety apples, is so popular it has sold out four times. Brightland\u2019s champagne vinegar, in a pert, beautiful bottle, would be at home on boutique shelves beside scented candles. Tart Vinegar, by Brooklyn-based Chris Crawford, has put celery vinegar on the condiment map. Acid League\u2019s six-month-old line of living vinegars (tagline \u201cGastronomy with Gut\u201d) made their way into Whole Foods within a month of launch. The phenomenon is coast to coast. There\u2019s Supreme, Keepwell, and Native in Pennsylvania; American Vinegar Works in Massachusetts; Lindera Farms in Virginia; MadHouse in Ohio; Yesfolk in New York; and Blackberry Farm in Tennessee. If you expand the list, as you should, to include shrubs\u2014vinegar-based cordials\u2014the number and variety of sour fermented libations astonishes. Many are sold for cooking or drinking. Their makers are young, environmentally savvy, concerned with biodiversity and upcycling excess harvests and food scraps. The vinegars are raw and living, with strands of sediment and \u201cmother\u201d (a cellulose layer comprising yeast and acetobacter) still paddling around inside them. They come in flavors like kombu, knotweed, banana, basil, and Montmorency cherry.", "It must be said that vinegar and its myriad flavors and benefits aren\u2019t new. As Sandor Katz, the unofficial grandfather of the fermentation movement, puts it concisely in his newest book, Fermentation as Metaphor, \u201cFermentation is not a fad, it is a fact.\u201d Fermentation has long been a matter of necessity\u2014what cultures worldwide have done to preserve food, make toxic ingredients edible, and maintain gut health. \u201cMaybe there are more products now,\u201d Katz tells me over the phone. \u201cBut there\u2019ve always been small-batch vinegars\u2014people with small diversified farms and fruit left over. I\u2019ve met hundreds of people with family vinegar practices that got passed down\u2014whether an Italian family that kept a little barrel where they\u2019d empty the dregs of bottles of wine, or Mexican families who had a practice of making pineapple vinegar.\u201d", "Shockey attributes vinegar\u2019s high visibility to general expansion of culinary horizons: \u201cI think people didn\u2019t know that vinegar doesn\u2019t have to taste like sour brown stuff or the sour clear stuff. It comes along with the discovery of other flavors.\u201d", "Brightland\u2019s champagne vinegar was all citrus and summer sun. Keepwell\u2019s apple cider vinegar was more apple-y than apples", "I set about acquiring as many of the available offerings as I could. I momentarily fretted that the strategy would result in a lot of wasted vinegar but then was heartened by a fundamental truth: Vinegar doesn\u2019t go bad. (Except on a geologic time scale.) Plus, the medical literature on the health benefits of vinegar consumption isn\u2019t fuzzy. Its antioxidants, micronutrients, and phenolic compounds are universally agreed to be good to our systems. Among other functions, they act as pre\u00adbiotics, feeding diverse gut bacteria (which we all need and most lack). The American Diabetes Association, in a study using apple cider vinegar, cited its ability to lower blood sugar. A lemon-vinegar mixture had antimicrobial properties that reduced salmonella to undetectable levels. Coupled with a good diet, apple cider vinegar may accelerate weight loss.", "As a clutter of bottles of varied sizes and hue began to accrue on my worktable, I considered the irony of a widespread embrace of microbes in a moment of pathogenic trauma. It gives me no small amount of faith in human intelligence that amid a global pandemic, we seem able to parse the difference between good bugs and bad ones. I turned to tasting all the vinegar, which was, with rare exceptions, entirely pleasant. The standouts were immediately clear. The Tart kombu vinegar was a condiment under the sea\u2014slightly salty, refreshing, and bracing. American Vinegar Works\u2019s hot (like spicy) apple-and-pear cider vinegar was slightly sweet, slightly peppery, suggesting a pour into tomato juice on ice, or a quick mix with seltzer on taco night. Brightland\u2019s champagne vinegar was all citrus and summer sun. Keepwell\u2019s apple cider vinegar was more apple-y than apples. I will never again make lemonade without adding a tablespoon of Acid League\u2019s honey yuzu living vinegar. Tasting Artizn\u2019s tonic of handmade aged Korean vinegar and fresh fruit juices, and then Apple State Vinegar\u2019s ginger and Hawaiian chili shrub poured with fizzy water, I realized almost unconsciously how narrow an experience it is to drink sodas that are only sweet. Remember the first time you had sea salt on chocolate? Or salted caramel? Sourness, so often isolated, is really essential to a full enjoyment of anything sweet. This argument found its finest point in Element\u2019s blueberry-rosemary shrub, which, when mixed at a ratio of one ounce shrub to five ounces seltzer, tastes precisely like I always imagined fresh spring water did in C. S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia books.", "Michael Harlan Turkell, author of the 2017 vinegar book Acid Trip, had told me that no investigation could be considered complete until I tasted vinegar made by Erwin Gegenbauer, an Austrian maker whom Turkell credited with his interest in vinegar in the first place. A fair amount of string pulling resulted in my being sent four bottles of Gegenbauer, which are extremely difficult to find in the United States. A more complete and lively tasting thing has never passed my lips. Erwin Gegenbauer confirmed to me directly that not only does he play music for his bacteria but he reads them stories. I cannot say whether it is the quality of the cucumbers or bananas or sherry that he ferments or the quality of his storytelling that is to thank for the absolute superiority of what he makes, but whatever it is, it is transformative.", "Pineapple Collaborative The Apple Cider Vinegar $24 PINEAPPLE COLLABORATIVE Shop Now Brightland Parasol champagne vinegar $22 BRIGHTLAND Shop Now", "Acid League honey yuzu vinegar $14 ACID LEAGUE Shop Now Tart celery vinegar $24 TART VINEGAR Shop Now", "American Vinegar Works apple and pear cider hot vinegar $12 AMERICAN VINEGAR WORKS Shop Now Keepwell apple cider vinegar $10 KEEPWELL Shop Now"], "authors": ["Tamar Adler", "Tamar Adle"], "keywords": ["champagne", "trip", "phenomenon", "cider", "apple", "tart", "smallbatch", "american", "shop", "fermentation", "vinegars", "kitchen", "vinegar", "acid"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
