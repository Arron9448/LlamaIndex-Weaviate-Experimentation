(Already a fixture on the runways both in New York and abroad, she\u2019ll soon find an even bigger audience: Last year, Dilone was cast as the supermodel Pat Cleveland in Halston, Ryan Murphy\u2019s limited series coming to Netflix in May.) Her life on Long Island, amid a vibrant Latinx community where \u201ceveryone knows each other\u2019s business\u201d (her parents grew up in the Dominican Republic), turned out to feel both nostalgic and strangely, wonderfully new: When she wasn\u2019t holed up reading somewhere (most recently, she revisited bell hooks\u2019s Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black), Dilone could be persuaded to join a raucous round of Phase 10, an old card game\u2014\u201cThe family goes insane over it,\u201d she says.", "In quieter moments, she\u2019s taken the opportunity to both work on herself and spend time with her mother. \u201cI got sober a year and a few months ago, and I meditate every day, I do yoga\u2014I need to take care of myself in order to have the relationships that I want with other people,\u201d Dilone says. \u201cMy mom\u2019s really seen this change in me.\u201d For one thing, the two are now communicating better than they ever have before; to help scale the language barrier between them, Dilone started taking Spanish lessons. (Only her eldest siblings speak the language fluently.) \u201cThat alone changed our relationship so much,\u201d she says. Now, \u201cMy mom and I will pray together, and she even meditated with me one time, which was really big for her.\u201d", "Dilone\u2014who will play supermodel Pat Cleveland in Ryan Murphy\u2019s Netflix series Halston\u2014wears a Valentino dress; valentino.com.
