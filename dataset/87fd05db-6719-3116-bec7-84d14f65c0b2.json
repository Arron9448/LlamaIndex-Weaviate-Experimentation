I have hundreds of ideas. They can come from so many different places, fan requests, scrolling through TikTok, but mostly from just my own boredom. Most of the ideas will be trashed though. I usually look through the list, then pick one for that day and create it. It\u2019s a pretty simple process, to be honest. I try not to overthink it. From my experience, people on TikTok want to see raw, relatable content that isn\u2019t too produced.", "I'm sure you've seen people tagging you in videos saying, \"Sorry, Brad Mondo.\" How does it feel to be TikTok\u2019s favorite hair guy?", "It's very flattering. I think the whole \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brad Mondo\u201d trend is hilarious. I hope nobody ruins their hair on purpose for me, though. That would make me very sad. I have the coolest job. I love being able to connect with people from around the world. Meeting fans in person is one of the best parts about my job, so I hope to do more of that when it\u2019s safe.", "Let\u2019s talk about your style. What are you into fashion-wise at the moment?", "I\u2019m going through a chunky boot phase right now. Every chunky black boot I see, I snatch up. I\u2019m super into the bell bottoms that I\u2019ve seen so many guys rocking lately, looking to purchase a pair of my own. Designers I\u2019ve been loving lately are Eckhaus Latta, Theo Philio, Ricky King, Angel Chen, Loewe, and Prada.", "What's the most special piece in your wardrobe?", "The most special piece in my wardrobe right now are my Saint Laurent burgundy velvet pants. They fit like a glove and they make my butt look so perky. They\u2019re also just so unique and beautifully crafted.", "What's the story behind these amazing pants? And these amazing pants?", "The first pair you mentioned comes from an amazing designer named Ricky King who hand-paints his garments. Those pants also have a matching blazer, I have a photo on my Instagram. I\u2019m obsessed with the look! [The second] pants were definitely a look. They\u2019re from Jaded London. At this time in my life, I was just searching for the next loudest garment I could find. Something that would scream hey, I\u2019m here! I think I achieved that with these."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["think", "ideas", "sense", "favorite", "fashion", "theyre", "amazing", "tiktoks", "killer", "tiktok", "hair", "stylist", "brad", "mondo", "look", "im", "special", "sorry", "pants"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
