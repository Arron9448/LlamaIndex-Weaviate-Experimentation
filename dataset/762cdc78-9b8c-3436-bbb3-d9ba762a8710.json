I was born the same year as she released her groundbreaking debut, Supa Dupa Fly, though I got to know her via via the osmosis of TV music channels. Growing up in the north-west of England, where Black children were few and far between, Trevor Nelson\u2019s MTV Base show The Lick \u2013 where he pulled turn-of-the-millennium rap, hip-hop and R&B from the vault \u2013 became something like Black music history class for my malleable childhood mind. He usually featured Missy, whose videos were always the best. She was an auteur of visuals that were cartoonish, bizarre and surreal, sometimes framed through the fish-eye lens of Hype Williams. Watching her hack out a CGI glob of spit and seeing it fly into a backup dancers\u2019 mouth used to make me shudder at the grossness and the delight in her macabre fantasy.", "A chubby, slightly awkward and quiet child, I secretly loved to dance when I was alone. Missy made impeccable music to move to thanks to the beguiling samples, ticking hi-hats and record scratches lacing the beats she co-produced with Timbaland. I bit down pangs of jealousy whenever I set eyes on her backup dancers \u2013 she often featured skilled child performers like Alyson Stoner, kids who could spin on their heads and violently contract their joints to the beat. I was captivated and deeply jealous that I hadn\u2019t been put into dance classes in infancy, and wanted to be exactly where they were performing alongside her.", "My bedroom became a makeshift Dave Meyers set. I breathlessly recreated her choreography, reeling off her cartoonishly vulgar lyrics without thinking (\u201cpockets mo\u2019 bigger than a stripper booty cheeks\u201d stuck in my head), practicing the moves I saw in videos like Ching-a-Ling. I didn\u2019t own any of the sorts of tracksuits, furry flat caps or shimmering neckpieces that Missy would coolly flaunt on camera, so instead I wore a single pink fingerless glove that came with a bicycle set I had. I looked ridiculous, and there was little rhyme nor reason to why wearing it made sense to me: it just seemed like the kind of thing I would expect Missy to wear.", "As a pre-teen I didn\u2019t fully comprehend the state of sexism towards Black women artists in hip-hop, or grasp the concept of what it meant to be a musical iconoclast, but I had an inkling she was someone of great significance. Perhaps I veered towards her music more than that of her male peers simply because she was a woman. Seeing the rap royalty in her videos hammered home that she was important to rap culture. She was weird and unique, but it was this uniqueness that her peers clearly respected.", "I also felt unique where I was. I spent my childhood more or less racially isolated, bar a few family friends who I didn\u2019t see all that often, though that isolation pushed me to lean into Black culture and to search out music like Missy\u2019s as cultural learning. I was often forced to listen to the music my friends loved \u2013 Girls Aloud and S Club 7 \u2013 but it was difficult translating my reverence for Missy to them. My classmates couldn\u2019t fathom her impact: several peers unceremoniously told me her music was \u201cweird\u201d and that she had \u201cno good songs\u201d.", "I realised they would likely never understand Missy\u2019s significance, but that was OK \u2013 she herself probably wouldn\u2019t have cared. A woman who wasn\u2019t afraid to sit in a dunce cap, dress as a scarecrow, or pull out whatever other look she decided would fit her three-minute fantasy worlds wasn\u2019t there to be \u201cgot\u201d. It didn\u2019t deter me from being a die-hard fan. I still am today, emboldened with the confidence that Missy\u2019s differences, and mine, were valuable expressions of blackness in a world that didn\u2019t always have the means to grasp it.", "On the days where I trawl through her catalogue, I often find my body ticking along with the muscle memory of her dance routines, ingrained via endless childhood viewings. It\u2019s as if she imprinted her tracks on me both in flesh and in my mentality: in places where Black culture will only ever be seen as weird, she taught me one should take pride in being different."], "authors": ["Christine Ochefu"], "keywords": ["peers", "elliotts", "iconoclasm", "sense", "didnt", "gave", "black", "videos", "identity", "set", "missys", "music", "missy", "weird", "rap"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
