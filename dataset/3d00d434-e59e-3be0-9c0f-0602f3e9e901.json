It gives the existing game a coat of HD polish, and, well, that\u2019s about it. And because I\u2019m a tremendous sucker for Katamari Damacy, I immediately downloaded it this morning. Yes, I am part of the problem.", "I\u2019ve played the first few levels on my PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility, and it\u2019s exactly what I thought it was going to be: Katamari Damacy. The cutscenes are sharp-looking and it now fills a 16:9 screen, but other than that it\u2019s the same game I fell in love with 16 years ago. Would it have killed Bandai Namco to do more than the absolute minimum effort here? Probably not. Do I wish this were part of a bigger collection of Katamari games? Absolutely! Ultimately, that disappointment melted away the moment I jumped into the first level and started rolling a bunch of stuff into a ball. Like I said, it\u2019s Katamari Damacy.", "The visuals maintain the original release\u2019s blocky aesthetic, which remains a large part of its charm. The objects that you collect are often just abstractions of their real-world counterparts, particularly the animals and people who inhabit these debris-scattered landscapes. Animations, when they\u2019re even present, are as simple as can be. That\u2019s not the point, however. I remember the spectacle of seeing so many objects displayed on my screen, like someone dumped a tub of Lego pieces on my floor. Of course, instead of just blocks and wheels, the \u201cpieces\u201d in Katamari Damacy start out as small as thumbtacks and cherries to bowling pins, bikes, and eventually entire continents.", "As the Prince rolls his ever-growing Katamari ball, the people begin screaming in terror as it approaches. Who can blame them? What started as a tiny collection of trash quickly scales to a very real threat. It still makes me laugh, but those moments are far from the most impactful moments on the audio front. Katamari Damacy\u2019s soundtrack is the only game soundtrack I\u2019ve actively sought out; I\u2019ve listened to it countless times over the years, and it never fails to put a smile on my face. In my opinion, it\u2019s about as close to perfection as it gets; even though I still have no idea of what any of the songs are about, they\u2019re at times inspiring, sentimental, and silly. And, above all else, they\u2019re undeniably catchy.", "If you\u2019ve never played the first game before, this is a great way to start. I\u2019m not in love with the $30 price point, especially considering the lack of any new content, but it is what it is. More than anything, I\u2019ve been consistently happy with how well it holds up. Nostalgia is a powerful force, but the joy that I\u2019m getting from rolling around and picking stuff up isn\u2019t reliant on the feelings of the past. It was a blast then, and it\u2019s still a great deal of fun now. And now that you can easily download it on current consoles, you have no excuse if you missed the ball the first time around."], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["thats", "stuff", "rules", "game", "xbox", "ps4", "katamari", "theyre", "reroll", "times", "surprise", "today", "ball", "ive", "damacy", "im"], "pubDate": "2020-11-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
