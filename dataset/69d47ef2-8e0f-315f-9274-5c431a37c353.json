The Rh\u00f4ne Valley had been the route of choice for marauding armies and peaceful traders for centuries, and Lyon\u2019s current site, at the confluence of the Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne Rivers, cried out to be fortified. In 43 BC the Romans founded the city, which subsequently grew in importance; the Emperor Claudius, conqueror of Britain, was born here. There are many Roman remains to see, but it was the production of silk that brought Lyon to prominence during the Middle Ages, and throughout the city you can see signs of the wealth that poured in \u2013 Renaissance buildings, imposing churches and Europe\u2019s largest pedestrian square, Place Bellecour, with a statue of Louis XIV as its focus. The Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is crammed with antique shops and intriguing traboules \u2013 narrow covered passageways enabling silk merchants to transport their wares to the river without getting wet \u2013 that today are a joy to amble through. As well as its glorious architecture, Lyon is generally acknowledged as France\u2019s (and to locals the world\u2019s) gastronomic capital. In fairness it has much to commend it: nouvelle cuisine was invented near here and the city boasts a huge array of speciality food shops and eateries, including 20 restaurants with one or more Michelin stars and countless little places to eat. While you enjoy your first lunch the ship quietly slips its mooring. Cruising upstream, we catch the first glimpses of the vine-clad slopes of the hazy green Beaujolais hills as we approach one of the world\u2019s most revered red-wine-producing regions. On our left we see the picturesque villages of Morgon, Fleury, Juli\u00e9nas, Ch\u00e9nas and many more, while on the right you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of snow-capped Mont Blanc \u2013 Western Europe\u2019s highest mountain. As the afternoon drifts into evening and we cruise past the town that gives them their name, the white wines of M\u00e2con hold sway \u2013 and what could be better than a cool, crisp glass in the lounge before enjoying this evening\u2019s culinary delights in the restaurant, prepared by our outstanding chef."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["rh\u00f4ne", "worlds", "silk", "provence", "shops", "cruise", "frances", "city", "town", "shakespeare", "europes", "lyon", "burgundy", "ms", "william", "river", "site"]}
