If you were hoping to part with $75 in order to get your hands on a candle with \u201cThis Smells Like My Vagina\u201d emblazoned on it then 1) get help, 2) don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Paltrow will be bringing out some more vagina-themed merchandise soon.", "Love her or hate her, you\u2019ve got to admit that Paltrow is a goddamn genius; the woman has her perfectly moisturized fingers on the zeitgeist like nobody else. She has turned Goop, her lifestyle brand, into a $250m business via a perfectly honed formula of aspiration and irritation. She doesn\u2019t care if we laugh at her $956 toilet paper or $66 jade vagina eggs; she doesn\u2019t care if we write angry articles about how she\u2019s peddling dangerous pseudoscience. She knows that all publicity is good publicity; as she has proudly stated: \u201cI can monetize those eyeballs.\u201d", "And it\u2019s not just eyeballs that the wellness entrepreneur has successfully monetized \u2013 it\u2019s vaginas. There\u2019s an amazing bit in Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s 2018 interview with Paltrow, where the Goop goddess talks to Harvard Business School students about some of the contentious advice on her site \u2013 for example, the idea that vagina jade eggs \u201cdo everything from fix your hormone levels to help with bladder control\u201d. This content isn\u2019t clickbait, Paltrow tells the class; she\u2019s way too classy for that \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural firestorm when it\u2019s about a woman\u2019s vagina.\u201d Paltrow reportedly then cupped her hands around her mouth and yodeled \u201cVAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!\u201d", "Paltrow isn\u2019t the only one snatching a profit from vagina-themed merchandise. The vagina-industrial complex is booming. 2017 saw a run on vagina necklaces. In 2018 models wearing vagina wigs (merkins) strutted down the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, the world\u2019s first vagina museum opened in London. Basically, if you put \u201cvagina\u201d in front of a random noun and Google it, the product probably exists. There\u2019s vagina lipstick and vagina moisturizer and vagina egg art. And, of course, there are now vagina candles.", "So why are vaginas suddenly everywhere? Well, as Dr Jen Gunter, a California gynecologist who has built a name for herself by debunking Paltrow\u2019s bad advice \u2013 and authored a book called the Vagina Bible \u2013 noted in a recent interview \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of money in vaginal shame\u201d. Women have been conditioned to think their bodies are \u201cdirty\u201d or abnormal since the beginning of time; the rise of \u201cwellness\u2019 has seen a boom in products, like vaginal wipes, designed to \u201cfix\u201d problems that don\u2019t exist. \u201cI have noticed a huge increase in what I can only describe as women being \u2018vaginally hyperaware\u2019,\u201d Gunter told NPR last year.", "There may be money in shame, but there\u2019s also a lot of cash in vaginal celebration. Reproductive rights have been top of mind in the Trump era; vaginas, like the pink pussyhats at the Women\u2019s March, have become a symbol of \u201cresistance\u201d. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fact that a certain type of corporate feminism has become very fashionable. The amazing thing about Paltrow is that she\u2019s capitalized on both vaginal shame and celebration. She\u2019s built a completely symbiotic vagina economy.", "Women hold more jobs than men for first time in nearly a decade", "Women in the US held 50.04% of jobs last month, according to new labor department data. This is only the second time in history that women have held more jobs than men; the first time was during the 2007-2009 recession, which was also nicknamed the \u201cMancession\u201d because layoffs hit men first. Unfortunately, while women might now outnumber men in the job market we are still getting paid a hell of a lot less.", "Karlie Kloss, Ivanka\u2019s sister-in-law, is going to vote Democrat in 2020", "Kloss is married to Jared Kushner\u2019s brother but says she won\u2019t vote for Trump. Perhaps she can have a word or two with Ivanka and persuade her to defect.", "Hong Kong Express Airways made a passenger take a pregnancy test", "The airline has apologised for asking 25-year-old Midori Nishida to take a pregnancy before flying from Hong Kong to to the island of Saipan, a US territory in the Pacific. Staff were apparently worried that Nishida was going to the island to give birth for immigration reasons. Nishida was not pregnant but she was, understandably, pretty upset at having to pee on a stick before being allowed to board.", "Anon was a woman \u2013 and she still is", "This chilling longread, Whatever Happened To ____? , is well worth your time. It\u2019s an anonymous piece by a woman whose husband, a failed writer, was so jealous of her success that he became violent. \u201cSo what I mean when I say that it\u2019s different being a woman writer, and particularly a mother who is also a writer, is that I don\u2019t think male authors are physically assaulted by their spouses for gaining a modicum of success,\u201d she writes. How many women\u2019s names don\u2019t we know because their voices and careers were silenced by an insecure spouse?", "The week in pet-riarchy", "Spotify has released a podcast for dogs to soothe them when they are home alone. I tried one episode (\u201cPup Fiction\u201d) out on my dog, Rascal. Hard to tell if he enjoyed it really. Don\u2019t want to Bragg, but I think he might be more of an In Our Time sort of pup."], "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "keywords": ["shame", "capitalized", "women", "men", "vaginal", "writer", "paltrow", "dont", "mahdawi", "vagina", "gwyneth", "theres", "arwa", "shes", "celebration", "woman"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
