But as Ms Yang\u2019s fans spread the gag, male netizens threw a tantrum. Last month a group of them reported the 28-year-old to the broadcast regulator for \u201csexism\u201d.

Guo Degang, a master of xiangsheng, a witty and often bawdy form of traditional comedy involving banter between two people, recently said he would not recruit women for his troupe (\u201cout of respect\u201d, he said). Very few women perform xiangsheng.", "Western-style stand-up comedy has taken off since it appeared in China a decade ago. It is proving to be a more accessible art form for female comics. With stand-up, says Evangeline Z, a 27-year-old comedian in Shanghai, \u201cthere are no barriers to joining as long as you can talk.\u201d Women bring new themes to the stage. On the latest season of \u201cRock and Roast\u201d, a vlogger quipped about coping with depression, twins joked about body-shaming and a car engineer about her career.", "The show, which began in 2017, has been a boost for Chinese stand-up and female participation in it. Evangeline Z says the form of comedy is \u201chuge\u201d in Shanghai. And she reckons up to half of the city\u2019s 50-odd weekly performances are by women. But male and female comics alike warn spectators that what they are about to say could be offensive and they should not take offence. Xiao Ju, a 22-year-old part-time comedian, also in Shanghai, says that showgoers expect to come in for \u201ca bit of easy laughter\u201d, so are ruffled when the ribbing reveals something about themselves.", "Female comedians elicit stronger reactions from the audience than male ones, says Xiao Ju. Many people are still shocked when women swear on stage. A gag about a prostitute told by a male comic draws tuts if delivered by a woman. \u201cSex is a perilous topic,\u201d says Xiao Ju. \u201cSo are shit, piss and farts. If a man jokes about these, everyone laughs. If a woman does, she is disgusting.\u201d For fear of offending, many stick to crowd-pleasing themes like families and jobs.", "Ms Yang has used the backlash against her gag to create a new one.
