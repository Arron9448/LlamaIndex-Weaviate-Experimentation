It's so rich it's normally served on a spoon instead of a glass.\"", "Essencia can only be produced in years with more or less perfect weather conditions for botrytis. And 2008 marked a particularly impressive year.", "It takes about a kilogram of \"incredibly ripe\" asz\u00fa grapes to produce just a teaspoon, while around 20 kilograms of grapes shriveled to asz\u00fa berries are required for a 37.5 centiliter bottle of wine, which usually contains around 3% alcohol.", "Although a lot of work is involved in gathering the grapes, the fermenting process is relatively simple, as \"you just bottle it and leave it.\"", "\"It's always the winemaker's decision when we bottle an Essencia,\" explains Zoltan Kovacs, general manager at the Royal Tokaji Winery, located in the Tokaj district of M\u00e1d.", "\"It could be after three, or four years, or even 10. This [2008] Essencia was bottled after eight years of maturation. It's a slightly unusual Essencia because it has a higher alcohol volume -- around 4%.\"", "Related content The best luxury bars in Budapest", "Valuable vintage", "A special permit from the Hungarian government was required to bottle Essencia 2018 in 1.5 liter decanters. Courtesy Royal Tokaji Wine Company", "This results in a distinct and hugely intense flavor, with hints of honey, apricot and tea, that's almost unbearably sweet. The liquid is so thick and syrupy, it's often served by the spoon. It's so mouth filling, it's hard to imagine having more than a few sips without feeling a little light-headed.", "Although Essencia 2008 has been on sale before, it's the exclusivity of this particular set that makes the decanters far more valuable than a standard bottle.", "Royal Tokaji had to obtain a special permit from the Hungarian government to bottle Essencia in 1.5 liter containers -- present laws only allow a maximum capacity of 0.5 liters.", "\"It really is one of a kind,\" says Charlie Mount, managing director of Royal Tokaji. \"I don't know if we'll ever be able to repeat it.\"", "The design of the unusual decanter was apparently inspired by the wine \"slowly dripping from the individually picked aszu berries.\"", "Once completed, the decanters were shipped to Portugal, where they were scanned and fitted with custom fitted corks, before being returned to Royal Tokaji, filled by hand and sealed.", "According to the team at Royal Tokaji, which was founded by British wine historian Hugh Johnson in 1990, one of the biggest successes of the venture is the fact that it's got the world talking about Hungarian wine again.", "\"This project is a symbol of one of Hungary's greatest exports,\" says Mount. \"Hungarians are very proud of the diversity of the wine produced in the country.", "\"They make a great range of wine. But I think from an outsider's perspective, Tokaji wine has this mystique. It's even mentioned in the Hungarian national anthem.\"", "Szentkiralyi shares this sentiment, stressing that the country still has a lot of unexplored potential with regards to its wine industry.", "\"The long winemaking traditions, the beneficial climate and the diversity of wine styles make it a great wine producing country, but the majority of production is still consumed locally,\" she says.", "While the collection may have put Tokaji, and effectively Hungarian wine, firmly back in the spotlight, its appeal, particularly that of Essencia, goes back centuries.", "Related content How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with", "Rich heritage", "France's Louis XIV famously referred to Tokaji wine as \"the wine of Kings and King of wines.\" Tamara Hardingham-Gill", "\"Even at the beginning of the 20th century, Tokaji was the most expensive wine in the world,\" says Mount.", "\"Doctors used to prescribe it to their patients.
