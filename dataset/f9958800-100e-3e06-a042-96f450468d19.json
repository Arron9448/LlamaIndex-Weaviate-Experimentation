In a press conference with Jens Stoltenberg, NATO \u2019s secretary-general, Mr Trump remarked that he could envisage France \u201cbreaking off\u201d from the alliance and observed, with something of the air of a mafia boss, that France \u201cneeds protection more than anybody\u201d. At a reception at Buckingham Palace later that evening, Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, was overheard mocking Mr Trump to his British, French and Dutch counterparts. When he heard about that, Mr Trump cancelled a closing press conference and left early. But although the American president was, predictably, the butt of much merriment among commentators, his words did not cause as much disquiet as those of France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "In an interview with The Economist published on November 7th, the French president said that he was not sure whether America would uphold NATO \u2019s mutual-defence clause, Article 5, and that the alliance was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d for want of co-ordinated decision-making in places like Syria. He also urged NATO to reassess its very purpose: \u201cThe unarticulated assumption is that the enemy is still Russia.\u201d In subsequent weeks Mr Macron has doubled down on his comments. On November 28th, two days after 13 French soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali, he insisted that terrorism, not Russia, was NATO \u2019s \u201ccommon enemy\u201d. On December 4th Mr Macron tweeted that Russia was a \u201cthreat\u201d but \u201cno longer an enemy\u201d, and \u201calso a partner on certain topics\u201d.", "Such talk alarms eastern European leaders, who believe that Mr Macron is undermining a consensus that was painstakingly forged in the years since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Many European officials are also unnerved by Mr Macron\u2019s openness to a Russian proposal for a moratorium on medium-range missiles; Russia\u2019s deployment of such missiles in violation of a cold-war treaty prompted America to walk out of the pact on August 2nd.", "Although some southern European members are privately sympathetic to the idea of detente with Russia, they were not willing to fall in behind Mr Macron in public. The official declaration from the leaders\u2019 meeting included prominent mentions of terrorism and, in an apparent sop to Mr Macron, promise of a \u201creflection process\u201d on NATO \u2019s \u201cpolitical dimension\u201d. But it also excoriated Russia\u2019s \u201caggressive actions\u201d and insisted that improved relations would only occur \u201cwhen Russia\u2019s actions make that possible.\u201d", "Mr Macron was also at the centre of a separate quarrel. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president, urged Mr Macron to \u201chave your own brain death checked out first\u201d after the French president rebuked Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria. That offensive targeted Kurdish militants who, backed by America, France and Britain, were serving as foot-soldiers against the Islamic State group.", "On December 3rd Mr Macron further accused Turkey of working with IS \u201cproxies\u201d in Syria and castigated Mr Erdogan for his purchase of Russia\u2019s advanced S -400 air-defence system. The animus is mutual: in the weeks before the meeting, Turkey said it was blocking NATO plans for the defence of Poland and the Baltic states until the alliance recognised the YPG , a Syrian Kurdish militia, as a terrorist group.", "Yet for all the awful political optics, the alliance is in rude military health. This year nine countries will hit the alliance\u2019s target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, up from just three a few years ago. By the end of 2020 Canada and European allies will have collectively invested $130bn over what they spent in 2016.", "In June the alliance agreed its first-ever space policy, building on the creation of new space units in America, France and Britain over the past year. And to the Pentagon\u2019s further delight, the declaration from the leaders acknowledged that \u201cChina\u2019s growing influence and international policies present both opportunities and challenges\u201d for the alliance.", "On December 3rd one European leader could be heard joking with another that Mr Macron had inadvertently employed the sort of reverse psychology used by parents against toddlers. Mr Macron\u2019s sharp criticism of NATO seemed to have persuaded Mr Trump that the alliance was a good idea after all. \u201cWhat I\u2019m liking about NATO is that a lot of countries have stepped up, I think at my behest.\u201d \u25a0", "Dig deeper:", "How NATO is shaping up at 70", "Assessing Emmanuel Macron\u2019s apocalyptic vision", "The French president on Europe\u2019s fragile place in a hostile world", "Read the transcript: Emmanuel Macron in his own words"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "NATO marks its 70th anniversary in typically chaotic fashion", "pubDate": null, "summary": "At a reception at Buckingham Palace later that evening, Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, was overheard mocking Mr Trump to his British, French and Dutch counterparts.\nWhen he heard about that, Mr Trump cancelled a closing press conference and left early.\nOn December 4th Mr Macron tweeted that Russia was a \u201cthreat\u201d but \u201cno longer an enemy\u201d, and \u201calso a partner on certain topics\u201d.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president, urged Mr Macron to \u201chave your own brain death checked out first\u201d after the French president rebuked Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria.\nMr Macron\u2019s sharp criticism of NATO seemed to have persuaded Mr Trump that the alliance was a good idea after all.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/12/05/nato-marks-its-70th-anniversary-in-typically-chaotic-fashion"}
