Commander Shepherd from the Mass Effect trilogy; Aloy in Horizon Zero Dawn\u2014we'd never root for them if they weren't, well, at least somewhat likable. Unlike movies or TV, video games are a place where fans get to play the protagonist\u2014help save the world, their friends, and themselves. It's not essential that players agree with every move their character makes. (Let\u2019s face it, Lara Croft made some pretty poor decisions in those Tomb Raider reboots.) But it's generally key that they have some kind of emotional connection with the character. It's true that video game heroes frequently fit into a narrow set of molds, but generally their cookie-cutter personalities are at least not grating. Or offensive. In other words, no one wants to play the asshole.", "But what happens when video game heroes break this mold? You fire up a brand-new game, get dropped into a world you don\u2019t know, and realize you\u2019re the antihero, someone you don\u2019t like and would never want to be.", "For many, that was the experience of playing God of War. Quite a few people recommended God of War to me, but I never checked out the original titles. So I came into the 2018 game, the eighth in the series, without knowing anything about Kratos\u2019 history or who he was before. It was envisioned as a new beginning for the franchise\u2014a continuation of 2010\u2019s God of War III, but with a new setting and a revitalized story\u2014making it the perfect entry point for a large franchise. I went in blind.", "Turns out, Kratos is kind of a dick. The entire thrust of God of War is that he and his son, Atreus, are mourning the death of Kratos\u2019 wife, Atreus\u2019s mother, and going on a journey to scatter her ashes. It\u2019s a simple, thoughtful story, but one complicated by the fact that Kratos is hiding his god status from his son and living incognito in the land of Norse mythology. (See? Kind of a tool.)", "It\u2019s clear from the start that Kratos\u2019 wife was the nurturer, and Kratos himself was the sullen, withholding, and emotionally distant father, because when the game begins, he\u2019s downright cruel to Atreus. It was honestly difficult to experience as a parent. Here\u2019s a kid mourning his mother, and turning to his father for comfort, and Kratos just berates him again and again. It took me weeks to make it through the first few hours of the game, because, despite the fantastic story, gorgeous scenery, and thoughtful gameplay, I felt no investment in the person I was playing. It\u2019s fantastic when studios change up the type of character you play. Creativity is good, doing something different is good. This should absolutely be encouraged\u2014playing a by-the-numbers character over and over again in the same kind of game can get tiresome. But when it\u2019s so different from what you expect, to the point you\u2019re not even sure you want to keep playing this character, what do you do?", "Honestly, usually I\u2019d just accept that this game was not for me, put the controller down, and move on with my life. But something made me stick with God of War. First, I really liked playing as a parent. That\u2019s not something that happens often in video games, and seeing a father-son relationship, even one I didn\u2019t entirely approve of, was personally gratifying. Second, Kratos might start out as a tough pill to swallow, but he\u2019s also voiced by Christopher Judge, who gives the character some much-needed humanity. Finally, a friend who\u2019d encouraged me to pick up the game in the first place assured me that the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus would change.", "Turns out, my friend was right. A few hours into the game, I could already see a big metamorphosis in Kratos as he came to respect his son\u2019s abilities. (Atreus is really handy in combat.) And as the story unfolds, it becomes Kratos\u2019 meditation on how to raise his son to be a good person\u2014what information to impart, how best to protect him, and how to shape him into a good person. It\u2019s quite thoughtful and beautiful, and it\u2019s something I would have missed if I hadn\u2019t stuck with God of War."], "authors": ["Swapna Krishna", "Swapna Krishn"], "keywords": ["worth", "kratos", "dickbut", "whos", "hard", "war", "playing", "game", "kind", "god", "play", "video", "good", "atreus", "character"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
