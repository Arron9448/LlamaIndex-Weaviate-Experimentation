She has collaborated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other organisations. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says, \u201cafter six years, things are finally falling into place.\u201d", "Her new collaboration is with War Child Holland, the non-governmental organisation that works exclusively to improve the resilience and wellbeing of children living with violence and armed conflict by providing vital child protection, education and psychosocial support. Barraud is working with War Child Holland as a \u2018changemaker correspondent\u2019 for Salesforce.org, the dedicated social impact team within Salesforce that delivers technology to nonprofits, educational institutions, and philanthropic organisations.", "She was thrilled to take the role, as she feels that War Child Holland\u2019s work is \u201ccompletely in line\u201d with what she does. She admires in particular how it focuses on children and psychosocial support, and feels it \u201cbrings more depth to the story\u201d.", "The children being helped by War Child Holland include those who had to flee their homes, leave everything behind, lost family and friends in conflict, experienced bomb attacks and lived with anger and fear. Children who experience things a child should never experience are left with the consequence, such as extreme anger, continuous stress and trust issues.", "The War Child offices in Amsterdam", "As part of the collaboration, she met and interviewed an Eritrean family who now live in the north of the Netherlands. The family were split up after the father fled the country due to political oppression and impending military service. He ended up in Israel. The family then sent one of their three sons, Tesfay, then 14, to the Netherlands. There, the family reunited after several years apart.", "Barraud was moved by the family and their \u201cbeautiful story\u201d. They told her they are \u201cvery thankful and happy\u201d to be back together. For the first time, the children enjoy going to school, unlike in Eritrea.", "\u201cThis is their new normal,\u201d says Barraud of their new school. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see them respond to their new teacher.\u201d Their mother spoke of her relief that \u201cfinally my children can go to school and not be afraid\u201d. The family also enjoy the presence of sheep in the north of the country, as they grew up with lots of sheep in Eritrea.", "Nevertheless, adds Barraud, it was clear that the children were dealing with some traumatic experiences. Some of their behaviour was \u201ctypical of children who have gone through something\u201d, she says.", "Barraud is using her experience as a photographer and storyteller to raise awareness of War Child Holland\u2019s efforts", "War Child Holland, together with Unicef Netherlands and Save the Children, also runs a programme at the school, providing a number of healing activities for the children, including sports, games and movement activities such as passing around an imaginary ball. The kids can take part as much or as little as they like.", "\u201cThese children have gone through way more than they should have,\u201d says Barraud. \u201cSome of them have seen the worst of humanity. They\u2019re just little kids but they have seen so much. They need love and time. Time to heal and to grow.", "", "\u201cThe War Child programme creates a safe space for kids to participate and just be children again.

He says the CRM technology enables War Child Holland to be changemakers and positively impact the lives of others.", "\u201cOf all the big data management systems, Salesforce.org is the one that is most focused on an easy user experience. It has helped us manage our volunteers much more efficiently,\u201d he says. He also appreciates the flexibility and scalability of its software. \u201cThe ability to make changes along the way is what keeps the quality of a project as high as possible,\u201d he says.", "There are an estimated 32 million displaced children in the world, and War Child says Salesforce.org has helped it scale efficiently as it rises to the challenge of helping those in need. \u201cIf we grow too big too fast, we risk becoming unstable,\u201d says Rob Williams, chief executive at War Child UK.", "Changemaking: the altruistic trend set to transform the future of business Read more", "\u201cSalesforce.org brings us the stability we need to keep expanding, while also increasing efficiency.\u201d", "With the vital work War Child does, it\u2019s essential it can expand in a sustainable way and be supported by the right tech. The sensitivities around providing humanitarian aid extend from seamless back-end management to knowing how to cope with potentially distressing situations \u2013 something Barraud knows all too well, having previously travelled to a camp to document the stories of Syrian refugees. She admits that such encounters come at a price for her. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not easy but I think it\u2019s important as a storyteller to have some sense of detachment.", "\u201cI do feel their pain but you can get a lot of hope and warm feelings when you think about the people who are changing their situation.\u201d", "Brought together by Salesforce.org, Barraud and War Child Holland are telling stories from people who don\u2019t have a voice; they would otherwise remain untold. Now, they could change minds and open hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to feel hate for someone when you know their story,\u201d says Barraud. \u201cWhat keeps me going is sharing stories of ordinary people, because we all have a story and we all deserve to be heard.\u201d", "To learn more about Salesforce.org \u2018Changemaker Correspondents\u2019, visit Salesforce.org/changemaker"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["way", "telling", "deserves", "war", "refugees", "holland", "championing", "children", "family", "salesforceorg", "blogger", "school", "child", "barraud", "heard"], "id": "8e16928f-4bbc-3a96-a5ca-8cca32ece0d4", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden"], "title": "The blogger championing refugees: 'We all have a story that deserves to be heard\u2019"}
