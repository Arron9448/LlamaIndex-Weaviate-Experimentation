He was 99. The Duke of Edinburgh was Britain\u2019s longest-serving consort.", "\"He accepted life as it came to him,\" royal author Anna Pasternak told Fox News. \"He probably did not want his wife to be queen so young because it affected his career. And yet he supported her. And in that process, he carved out a role for himself and became an innovator. He\u2019s got tremendous legacies in this country.\"", "QUEEN ELIZABETH TO ENTER 8 DAYS OF MOURNING FOLLOWING PRINCE PHILIP'S DEATH", "\"He was known for empowering the young,\" Pasternak continued. \"He was responsible for keeping green spaces. We have what\u2019s called the \u2018village green\u2019 here in England. In inner-city areas, parks were created because he realized the young needed fresh air and green space. He was a conservationist and way ahead of his time before it became fashionable.

In the U.K., even though we knew he was very old and had been unwell, we all desperately wanted him to make his 100th birthday. There will be an absolute universal outpouring of affection towards the queen. And within that is a gratitude to the Duke of Edinburgh who supported her and made her so happy.\"", "\"Philip was Elizabeth\u2019s backbone,\" she shared. \"Yes, he made politically incorrect remarks and he had quite the sense of humor.
