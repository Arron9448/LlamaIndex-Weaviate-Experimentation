Her cheeks and neck looked skeletal. She kept her answers short and rolled her eyes. A familiar pattern was unfolding.", "Back in the car, Heidi locked the doors. Give me my phone, Eva said.", "Eva was among the thousands of human trafficking victims targeted and exploited in the US every year, of whom only 10% are ever identified. In New Mexico, a mere 160 cases have been opened since 2016. But, while Native Americans make up about 11% of the state\u2019s population, they account for nearly a quarter of trafficking victims, according to data compiled from service organizations.", "A 16-month investigation by Searchlight New Mexico has found that when it comes to human trafficking, indigenous women and girls are the least recognized and least protected population in a state that struggles to address the problem. An almost total lack of protocols, mandated training and coordination among law enforcement systems and medical institutions has ensnared victims in ongoing cycles of exploitation.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Experts find there\u2019s a vast lack of understanding about the ways Native women in rural areas, like McKinley county, are trafficked \u2013 and how the police, legal and medical systems fail them. Photograph: Adria Malcolm", "That includes Eva, who, by her own recounting as well as notes from medical personnel, caseworkers and therapists, was systematically lured, coerced, threatened and traded for sex for money, drugs and favors over a two-year period. Her name, along with those of her family members, have been changed for reasons of safety and privacy.", "Eva showed many of the warning signs of someone who has been trafficked. She was anxious, depressed, mute and had little sense of time. She was frequently reported missing, appeared malnourished and occasionally bruised. But despite multiple brushes with law enforcement agencies and healthcare institutions, she was not once questioned or screened for human trafficking.", "\u201cNobody saw me,\u201d she says. \u201cNot until the very end.\u201d", "\u2022\u2022\u2022", "Growing up on the Zuni and Navajo reservations of western New Mexico, Eva moved continuously between her mother\u2019s home and that of her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. The only constant in her life was Haley, her sister four and a half years her junior.", "Eva was the effusive one, admired for her lanky limbs and her gift for sketching. She was the one to initiate games of basketball in the driveway, scolding her cousins when they didn\u2019t pass the ball to Haley.", "The girls\u2019 mother, Lea, worked multiple jobs as a nurse\u2019s aide, and the family had a comfortable life in an area where the median household income hovers at $27,000 a year. Lea entered the girls in child beauty pageants in the big cities of Gallup, Albuquerque and Las Cruces. She was the kind of mother who on a whim would take them on a road trip to White Sands Monument or the redwood forests of northern California.", "Dire streets: muddied roads and broken promises on the Navajo nation Read more", "That all changed the year Eva turned 11. Lea had long struggled with alcoholism, and as the disease worsened she increasingly left her daughters in the care of others or alone at home. When she was too intoxicated to drive, she propped Eva on a pile of blankets to see over the steering wheel of the family\u2019s 1999 Honda Civic. Eva began skipping school, where she got in trouble for smoking. In seventh grade, she was expelled for fighting and never went back.", "Only later would Eva and Haley confide in their grandmother that their stepfather physically, sexually and emotionally abused them. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell Grandma what happens in this house,\u201d he often said.", "Heidi said she kept as close a watch as she could, and when she saw them, she would give the girls almost anything they wanted. For Eva\u2019s 12th birthday, her grandmother bought her an iPhone, so Eva could call whenever they were left alone at home.", "\u201cBuying her that phone was the worst thing I ever did,\u201d Heidi says now.", "\u2022\u2022\u2022", "On 8 December 2015, Eva saw a Facebook message from a young man with a thick brow and a round jawline. \u201cI remember you from middle school,\u201d he wrote. Eva, then 13, didn\u2019t recognize him, but she assumed she knew him. \u201cEveryone on the reservation knows everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cOr they pretend they do.\u201d", "D, as she came to call him, enthused about her large brown eyes, her dimples and the way she wore her hair in French braids. He asked for photos and she sent him intimate selfies, soon followed by more explicit pictures. She eventually drove to his house in her mother\u2019s car \u2013 propped up on blankets \u2013 and they drank beer and smoked marijuana. D told her he loved her, and Eva felt needed and exultant, unmoored from the problems at home.", "As the months went by, he took more photos and recorded videos \u2013 usually of Eva performing oral sex. His affectionate ways were soon supplanted by forceful sex, violence and threats. He threatened to share his photos and videos on Facebook and hurt her little sister if she were to say anything. He invited other men \u2013 he said they were his brother and cousin \u2013 to the house, where they also molested and raped Eva. She remembers initially resisting, punching one of them, and hearing the words \u201cJust do it\u201d before a weight fell on her.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Nobody saw me. Not until the very end.\u2019 Photograph: Adria Malcolm", "In the fall of 2016, D redoubled his threats against Eva, promising to harm her grandmother and abduct her sister if she spoke out. If anyone could have helped Eva, it would have been her mother. Lea knew, or at least suspected, what was happening; she had seen the nude photos of her daughter and did nothing. Then in November, she died after an incident near Shiprock.", "For weeks after the funeral Eva lay on the floor of her grandmother\u2019s house, while her phones buzzed with messages. By now, she had four Samsung cellphones, all supplied by D, who texted daily, demanding more photos, threatening violence unless she picked herself off the ground and met him. Which she did, as if pulled by a wire tethered to her feet \u2013 driving or being driven to faraway towns and switching between cars with strange men.", "\u2022\u2022\u2022", "Sex trafficking is defined as the exploitation of individuals through threat or use of force, coercion and/or fraud to induce a \u201ccommercial sex act\u201d.

It is intended to serve as a warning to policymakers \u2013 though not all tribal leaders regard the issue with the same urgency. The Navajo nation police chief, Philip Francisco, for one, says he does not see sex trafficking as a problem in his jurisdiction. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a border issue,\u201d he says.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The number of trafficking victims in New Mexico has consistently risen over the last three years. While Native people make up nearly 11% of the state population, they account for a quarter of the sex trafficking victims served. Photograph: Adria Malcolm", "Of course, trafficking and exploitation are hardly a new phenomenon in indigenous communities. For centuries, sexual violence has been a cornerstone of the treatment of Native American populations, integral to colonization and displacement. Sex trafficking of contemporary indigenous women is \u201calmost indistinguishable from the colonial tactics of enslavement, exploitation, exportation and relocation\u201d, writes Sarah Deer, professor of law at Kansas University and author of The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America.", "Today, high rates of chemical dependency, abuse and involvement in the foster care system exacerbate vulnerability to predators, the vast majority of whom are non-Native. As noted in Crotty\u2019s white paper, female minors, homeless youth and transgender or two-spirit/LGBTQ+ people are most vulnerable to trafficking. And, as tribal leaders have found in NDFS cases, family members have been known to exchange younger children for money, drugs or basic needs. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our children trafficked by their own family, and most don\u2019t even know they were trafficked,\u201d says Crotty.", "After conducting more than 75 interviews and gathering data from 18 agencies, Searchlight shared Eva\u2019s story with nine tribal police officers, four tribal officials and two former clinicians for the Indian Health Service. No one expressed surprise.", "\u201cTribal agencies are understaffed, underfunded and undertrained in this type of response,\u201d says Darren Soland, Ramah Navajo police chief. \u201cOnce someone who is being victimized goes from tribal to state land or to a municipality and maybe comes back, it\u2019s hard to get the agencies to reach out and communicate with each.\u201d", "A July 2019 study in the journal Criminology & Public Policy explored the reasons why law enforcement officers rarely recognize trafficking victims and found that some say they are unaware that this is a crime over which they have jurisdiction while others don\u2019t believe it is an issue present in their communities. The majority of states, including New Mexico, require no law enforcement training on human trafficking.", "And while lawmakers have proposed legislation, their efforts have largely stalled. The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which would better assist indigenous victims and increase cross-agency communication, is stalled in the US.
