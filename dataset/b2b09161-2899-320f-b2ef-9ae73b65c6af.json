I lasted in that job for only a few weeks. Meanwhile, the poetry scene, centered on St. Mark\u2019s Church, was both expanding and unravelling, as rock songs displaced poems as soul food for young hearts and minds. But the art scene boomed. Art parties were immeasurably more fun than poetry parties.", "Starting in 1967, I began writing regularly for the Times\u2019 Sunday Arts & Leisure section.

To my surprise, I am taken seriously. The artist agrees to perform the work the very next day. As for the police, who will obviously be called when the street below is showered with golfballs and broken glass, the museum director has a plan. There is a secret passage from the loft to a building next door, he says, and in that building a large sum of money is hidden that we can use to finance our escape from Cleveland. We all agree that \u201cGolf\u201d will be an event of tremendous artistic importance.", "That prose-poetic experiment ended when I entered Jungian therapy and presented my dreams for interpretation.

Higher up, there was snow, and there were bear tracks in the snow. I thought the mountaintop was a sloping ridge. I crawled up it and found a sheer drop facing the inaccessible summit. Had I had acrophobia before, or did my subsequently lifelong case of it begin then and there? I hugged rock and sobbed. The next thing I remember is striding and tumbling down a side of the mountain covered in deep gravel, grabbing bushes to slow myself. I alighted in brambled woods, disoriented.
