I was trying to put my finger on why I disliked her so much. Audrey. My brother\u2019s new girlfriend. I thought maybe it was the different shades of beige she\u2019d been wearing all week. \u201cYou must really like beige,\u201d I said, and she said: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYour pants,\u201d I said, \u201cyour shirts\u2014all beige. Or . . . oatmeal, maybe.\u201d \u201cOatmeal\u201d sounded less aggressive. I\u2019d been told I was a little mean at times, in my choice of words. \u201cMy pants are green,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cJeanne is right,\u201d my brother said, and it was the first time he\u2019d agreed with me all year. \u201cYour pants aren\u2019t green, babe.\u201d Just like that, Audrey found out that she was color-blind. She spent the rest of our family vacation (a ten-day biennial endeavor in the south of Spain) pointing at different things. \u201cAnd what color is that?\u201d she\u2019d ask. My parents thought it was so interesting. Especially because they could give Audrey clear answers, present themselves as experts on something they\u2019d never really thought twice about. \u201cWhy, Audrey, this is orange,\u201d my father would say, and he\u2019d describe orange, trapped between yellow and red\u2014he\u2019d talk about sunsets, the fruit, quote Henri Bergson, tell her that maybe orange was the only color there was, in the end: \u201cThere\u2019s just so much to say about orange. I\u2019d never really thought about it.\u201d \u201cThe things you take for granted,\u201d my mother added.", "I thought Audrey was faking it. How could you make it to twenty-six and not notice that you were color-blind? She needed to be the center of attention, is what I thought. My brother was a painter. Had they never talked about color? \u201cNo, Jeanne, we never talked about color,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would we talk about color? Did you and Matt talk about color?\u201d \u201cMatt teaches geography.\u201d Lino hadn\u2019t liked my ex much, though I\u2019m not even sure he was aware of that. For the past five years, during my whole relationship with Matt, my brother had only ever uttered Matt\u2019s name to isolate the qualities of an average human being, for the purpose of illustrating a point he was making about culture, or policy, or cultural policy. \u201cPeople like Matt don\u2019t care about contemporary theatre,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cThey work hard, they come home, they just want a beer and a show.\u201d I\u2019d told him once how condescending that was, using Matt as the gold standard for the random and the small, but he had pretended to admire him, us\u2014Don\u2019t throw me into this, I\u2019d thought and not said\u2014for our pragmatism, our ability to focus on the day to day. He\u2019d also said that there was no shame in normalcy, that I was right to be drawn to it, especially after my previous boyfriend.", "Audrey and Lino had been dating for more than a year. But they lived in the United States and I in Paris, so I was meeting her for the first time. All I knew about her was what my brother had told us over Christmas dinner, eight months earlier, when their relationship was new enough that she\u2019d spent the holidays with her own family. \u201cWhere did she go to school?\u201d I asked. \u201cLewis & Clark.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Where the Daily Planet gets its interns?\u201d \u201cLewis & Clark,\u201d Lino said. \u201cNot Lois.\u201d I thought he was making this up. I had to look it up on my phone. I knew he must have had the same thought. Watching \u201cLois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\u201d every Tuesday night in the mid-nineties was one of the only good moments we\u2019d shared. Matt, whom I was still engaged to at the time, then told me everything he knew\u2014which happened to be a lot\u2014about the Lewis and Clark expedition. So I knew a bit about Audrey\u2019s education, and I knew that she\u2019d been adopted, of course, which made me envious. To be able to look at the people who love you the most and not have to worry that you\u2019ll turn out exactly like them must be amazing, I thought. An endlessly renewable source of relief.", "\u201cNow I wonder if one of my biological parents was color-blind,\u201d Audrey said one evening, a day or two after finding out that she\u2019d been wearing beige all along. We were having dinner on the beachside promenade\u2014seafood, tapas. It was about ten o\u2019clock and people were still going into the sea. I hated having to pretend that it was tragic that Audrey would never get to know what kind of eye problems her real parents had had. What she truly didn\u2019t know was how lucky she was. In fact, there was a part of me that believed that Audrey knew exactly how lucky she was, but that she also knew that, as an orphan, there were all these strings she could pull to induce sympathy, love, and guilt, to buy excuses, to explain herself; and that she intended to pull those strings until they broke, which they never would, because when you were a born orphan\u2014that is, when you\u2019d actually spent your first few months or years in an orphanage\u2014you got to be an orphan for life. You\u2019re expected to get over losing your parents if you knew them, but not if you never met them. Even when Audrey was in her eighties, it would be one of the first things people said about her: \u201cShe didn\u2019t have it easy. She was an orphan.\u201d \u201cThat must be hard,\u201d my mother said, \u201cnot knowing anything about them.\u201d Audrey smiled and took a sip of wine. One thing I didn\u2019t understand was how my mother could\u2019ve read so many novels and still take anything anyone ever said at face value. As if deception and complications were only tricks that fiction had invented to compensate for the lack of duplicity in actual people. \u201cIt comes in waves,\u201d Audrey explained, \u201cthe wondering about them.\u201d I myself wondered how I could prove that Audrey was faking color blindness. There had to be tests, I thought. But they would probably be easy to flunk. It\u2019s easy to pretend you can\u2019t see certain things. I got a whiff of cigarette smoke from the next table. I inhaled as deeply as I could. Audrey coughed dramatically. \u201cI\u2019ll ask them to put it out,\u201d Lino, her savior, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop selling cheesy snacks near the petting zoo.\u201d Cartoon by Benjamin Schwartz \u201cWe\u2019re outside, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t ask the locals to put their cigarettes out. We\u2019re guests in their country.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not even Spanish,\u201d my brother said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but the people who actually live here don\u2019t go to the beach or the promenade. It\u2019s all tourists in this area.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about? Everyone\u2019s speaking Spanish.\u201d (We were speaking French, by the way. Our language. Audrey was fluent in it, of course.) We\u2019d been coming to Almer\u00eda for more than ten years; my parents had visited one summer and fallen in love with the place. I\u2019d met countless locals on the promenade. \u201cYour brother is right,\u201d my father said. \u201cThe people who live here live with their backs to the sea. Just look at Joaqu\u00edn.\u201d Joaqu\u00edn was a chess partner he\u2019d befriended in town. \u201cDoesn\u2019t even own a bathing suit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite natural, if you think about it, to not take advantage of your own city the way a tourist would,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they swim early in the morning,\u201d I said. \u201cOr in the off-season.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d my brother said. \u201cLike you go to the Eiffel Tower in the off-season?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d I said. \u201cHow often do you go to the Eiffel Tower?\u201d Audrey asked me. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as the off-season for the Eiffel Tower,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s never been,\u201d my brother said. I often felt a little betrayed by Lino, which probably stemmed from the initial lie that had accompanied his birth. When my mother was pregnant with him, she\u2019d decided to assuage a jealousy I don\u2019t remember feeling by telling me that the baby would come out of the womb carrying a present for me. For a whole year, I believed that Lino had been born carrying my doll Polly. For a whole year, I expected random toys to fall out of my mother\u2019s vagina. When I realized that the doll had come from the same shop that all my other toys had come from, I became a bit wary of Lino. It wasn\u2019t fair\u2014he hadn\u2019t been the one to lie to me\u2014but it was hard not to look at him and my parents as a group plotting against me, not to wonder what else they were hiding. When Lino decided to become a painter and my parents were supportive, I\u2019d felt excluded from their group again. Because my parents were both teachers (history for him, French for her), I\u2019d grown up under the impression that people matured only in order to teach what they\u2019d been best at in school to the next generation, and so on and so forth until the species died off. (I teach algebra.) But Lino deciding to pursue a career in doing instead of teaching, encountering success in the doing\u2014that had opened a gate to possibilities I hadn\u2019t been aware of. I had no talent whatsoever and couldn\u2019t have taken advantage of the gate if I\u2019d wanted to, but still. I felt like an idiot for not having seen it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the Eiffel Tower again,\u201d Audrey said. She\u2019d been to Paris once, as a teen. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d", "Back at the apartment we were renting, I Googled color blindness. I learned that color-blind people could sometimes see things that those who saw all colors couldn\u2019t. They could see hidden patterns formed by black-and-white dots swimming among other black-and-white dots. I looked at a series of Ishihara plates, but the hidden figures for the color-blind were actually quite distinguishable to me. I could pass the test that proved I was color-blind, as well as the one that proved I wasn\u2019t. Online, at least. According to how Audrey described seeing things, she seemed to be the \u201cprotanopia\u201d type of color-blind. Most things, to her, were a little green. I Googled \u201chow do color-blind people see rainbows,\u201d and found a page that showed how people with different types of color blindness saw different things. Had Audrey truly believed her whole life that the stripes on the American flag were forest green? Had she never wondered why almost everything was green? Protanopia was extremely rare in women, the Internet said. Like, 0.03 per cent of women had it. I guess Audrey was very special, after all.", "I knew why I disliked Audrey. I\u2019d quit smoking the week before the vacation, thinking that maybe I could be spared my mother\u2019s remarks about how she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her child dying before her, \u201cof cancer.\u201d Being in withdrawal from nicotine, I knew that I wasn\u2019t in the best state of mind to meet new people, or to give anyone a chance. What I did not know, however, was that no one was going to notice that I wasn\u2019t smoking. And that, of course, made me want to smoke. People make such a big deal of it when you smoke, but then no one registers it when you quit, or, if anyone does, it\u2019s the quickest pat on the back\u2014you\u2019re doing something good for yourself, after all, so how hard can it be? Whereas being color-blind? That must be tough.", "The next day, I went out to have breakfast on the promenade, like I always do. Audrey had risen early and gone swimming. I could see her in the distance from the terrace of the Delf\u00edn Verde, the caf\u00e9 just downstairs from our apartment. I ordered my coffee and orange juice in Spanish from the same waiter who\u2019d taught me how to, years before. He\u2019d noticed right away that I\u2019d quit smoking. He\u2019d made a big show, since then, of taking the ashtray off my table every morning. \u201cI saw you and your family last night,\u201d he told me, slowing his Spanish as much as he could. \u201cYour brother, he has a new girlfriend!\u201d He hadn\u2019t commented on Matt\u2019s absence this year, though Matt had come on our family vacation the past two times. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cHer name is Audrey. She cannot see colors.\u201d I didn\u2019t know the Spanish word for \u201ccolor-blind.\u201d He thought that I meant she wasn\u2019t racially prejudiced. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, and then I showed him an Ishihara color plate on my phone. \u201cAh! Dalt\u00f3nica,\u201d he said. \u201cS\u00ed,\u201d I said. \u201cDalt\u00f3nica.\u201d He thought that was interesting, but I forgave him, because waiters have to pretend that everything is interesting. \u201cThey make glasses for the color-blind now,\u201d he told me, pointing at his own frames to illustrate the Spanish word gafas. \u201cThey put the glasses on, and they can see colors.\u201d I knew what he was talking about. My Internet search had turned up those glasses, but I hadn\u2019t bothered reading about how they worked. I\u2019d taken it for granted that such a thing would exist, as I took most scientific progress for granted, the vaccines and the high-speed Internet. It seemed normal to me that someone would come up with these ideas and solutions, fix every one of our physical problems, try to abolish space and time, until we were left to deal with the truth of life (once everything else was solved, we would know what that was), but my waiter, and the way he mimed putting the glasses on, the joy that a color-blind person would experience, apparently, seeing my half-empty glass of orange juice (it was, in fact, a pretty color)\u2014it all reminded me of how science used to feel magical. My parents came out of our building then, my father dressed to go play chess in town, my mother holding her goggles, swim cap, and flotation belt. She knew how to swim, but sometimes, she said, she didn\u2019t feel like making the effort. I waved at them, and they took it as encouragement to sit with me. \u201cHave you had breakfast yet?\u201d my mother asked. \u201cI know it\u2019s useless to try talking to you if you haven\u2019t had breakfast yet.\u201d My father nodded gravely. I pointed at my glass of orange juice and empty coffee cup. \u201cThat\u2019s not breakfast,\u201d my mother said. \u201cYou need solids in the morning.\u201d My father silently agreed with that, too. \u201cTall glass of water first, sure, to get rid of the toxins, but then you have to have a nice assortment of food groups,\u201d my mother added. \u201cYour digestive system needs variety. It\u2019s like anything else: routine kills it.\u201d These were the people who\u2019d told me that if I swallowed chewing gum it would make bubbles in my stomach and I would explode. \u201cIs Lino up yet?\u201d I asked. I wanted to change the topic to one that pricked her instead of me. It was only a little past nine, and Lino never got up before noon\u2014he could even go until 3 p.m., if he\u2019d worked late, and he never skipped his nap in the afternoon, either. This sleeping pattern was the only habit of his that my mother couldn\u2019t fully get behind. Of course, he was an artist, and artists had a different relationship to time, but fourteen hours a day? Was he ill? Was he depressed? Wasn\u2019t all this sleeping a cry for help? She\u2019d gone over all these theories through the years, but her son was perfectly fine. A high-functioning artist. I, on the other hand, had had two nervous breakdowns in the past four years and, since the second one, had been taking citalopram steadily and Xanax as needed, but, my sleeping schedule being what it was (i.e., that of a person who had an actual job to go to, a job she relied on for food and shelter), my mother never worried. I\u2019m not saying that she should have, mind you, or that she was a bad mother for not doing so. I don\u2019t tell her everything. \u201cHave you heard from Matt lately?\u201d she asked me. I guess she was learning to counter my low blows with some of her own. \u201cI almost called him the other day,\u201d my father said. \u201cI had a question about sinkholes.\u201d \u201cMatt\u2019s a geographer, not a geologist,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he still knows about sinkholes. He knows everything.\u201d \u201cBut he hates it when people just assume he does,\u201d I said. \u201cTake his knowledge for granted. He wants to surprise you with it, to be admired, not be used like a search engine.\u201d \u201cDid you stop admiring him?\u201d my mother asked. \u201cDid he stop surprising you? Is that what happened?\u201d What had happened was that I had found out Matt had been sleeping with another teacher at our high school for months, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell my parents. I didn\u2019t want them to think less of him. He\u2019d been what they liked best about me the past few years. \u201cI think Audrey and Lino still surprise each other,\u201d my mother said. My father agreed, and they both scanned the beach ahead of us for Audrey and her pink towel, which she thought was baby blue. They really liked her, I guess. They wanted her to stay in the picture. Audrey was done swimming and now looked out at the Mediterranean like she was the only person who really understood it, the only one who\u2019d ever had deep thoughts about the sea. What shade of green did she see the water as? My parents went on with their day, my father to his chess game, my mother to lay her towel next to Audrey\u2019s, and I stayed at the Delf\u00edn and looked at the horizon. I\u2019d always been good at doing nothing, but, since I\u2019d quit smoking, staring emptily into the distance had become the only thing I could do without wanting a cigarette too badly. I watched the ferry that left for Morocco cross paths with the one that was arriving. I tried not to have any deep thoughts about paths crossing, people never meeting, or the refugee crisis. Deep thoughts made me want to smoke. Pure boredom did, too, though, so there was a balance to find. I thought about how I could look at the sea for hours without ever feeling the need to go in, no matter how hot it got. I loved looking at the waves the way I loved looking at the Eiffel Tower when it showed up on my commute. Never occurred to me to go visit it. My mother floated on her back, a little way from shore. Audrey was on her stomach now, tanning and being accosted by a teen-ager selling friendship bracelets. He sat in the sand next to her and they chatted for a while, pointing at different bracelets he had pinned on his cardboard panel. I assumed that she was telling him about her recently discovered color blindness, and how she would need his help to pick out bracelets, since she couldn\u2019t trust her taste anymore. (Audrey spoke a little Spanish, too.) Back at the apartment, over lunch, she gave me one. \u201cTo thank you for making me realize I was color-blind,\u201d she said. She\u2019d thanked me about a hundred times already. It was now the only thing she could think of to talk to me about, as if I didn\u2019t have any other purpose in life than to discuss her disability. \u201cI also got one for Marion,\u201d she said, handing me a second bracelet. (Marion is my daughter. Not with Matt but with the man before\u2014him, my parents never ask about. Like me, all they know is what they see on TV, or used to see on TV, when he was a participant in, and nearly won, a \u201cBig Brother\u201d-type reality show, years after vanishing from our lives.) \u201cThat is so thoughtful,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love it.\u201d \u201cI remember you saying that she loved purple, that her whole room was the color of eggplant, so that\u2019s why I got her this one.\u201d \u201cHow did you know it was purple?\u201d I said. \u201cWell . . . I asked the boy who sold the bracelets if he had anything purple. I think that\u2019s the one he told me to get. . . . Wait, is it not purple?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s purple,\u201d I said. \u201cBe thankful it doesn\u2019t look like someone you know.\u201d Cartoon by P. C. Vey \u201cPurple as it gets,\u201d Lino added. She sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting Marion at Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a trip,\u201d my father said, politely. He loved his granddaughter\u2014he just didn\u2019t like her much. Few people did. The reason Marion was at camp and not with us was officially because she needed to learn to make friends\u2014and I hoped that that was what she was doing\u2014but mostly because I wanted to avoid quarrels between her and my father. Marion, who was twelve years old, was the reason he\u2019d started taking chess lessons, and practicing with Joaqu\u00edn when in Spain and with some other old man when in France. The previous winter, Marion had thrown a chessboard at him and called him an idiot, for castling when he had\u2014for castling stupidly, in general, just to show that he knew what castling was. After he asked for an apology, she\u2019d declared that he was the one who should apologize, for all the scholar\u2019s-mate openings he\u2019d inflicted upon her over the years, all of them repeated insults to her intelligence. My father wasn\u2019t going anywhere anymore without his two chess bibles: one about openings, the other called \u201cThe Art of Sacrifice in Chess,\u201d two recommendations he\u2019d got from Marion. Through me. \u201cI really hope I have a daughter one day,\u201d Audrey said. She didn\u2019t look at my brother while she said this but at her plate of goat cheese and tomato jam. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be able to.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d my mother asked. \u201cI just read this book by a famous psychologist that said that a woman couldn\u2019t have a daughter as long as she hadn\u2019t resolved all her issues with her own mother.\u201d \u201cThat can\u2019t possibly be true,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes a lot of sense, actually,\u201d my mother said. I wondered how she\u2019d ever been trusted to teach anyone anything. \u201cAnd since I\u2019ll never know who my real mother was,\u201d Audrey went on, in case we hadn\u2019t figured out that that was where she was heading, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to resolve our issues and have my own daughter.\u201d I stared at Lino to get him to acknowledge that his girlfriend\u2019s reading list was a little embarrassing. \u201cMaybe the fact that you have a good relationship with your adoptive mother will help?\u201d he said.", "While they all napped, I watched videos of color-blind people trying on their color glasses for the first time. In none of the videos was the reaction subdued. Seeing in full color for the first time was apparently akin to having an orgasm. Some people shouted, some people cried. Some people couldn\u2019t keep the glasses on\u2014or off\u2014for more than a few seconds at a time; they needed to contrast the colorful and the bland. I tried imagining it: never having seen the color of beer, the colors of a Matisse painting. Maybe I\u2019d cry, too. I\u2019d cried at less beautiful things. Before I knew it, the glasses were in my cart, and I was considering shipping options. I entered my brother\u2019s address in Brooklyn, then backpedalled and checked the box for expedited international shipping. I wanted to witness it. I would witness it in forty-eight hours or less: Audrey seeing her first real sunset. I owed her a gift, what with the thoughtful, ugly bracelets she\u2019d bought from that teen on the beach. I believed that having seen all these videos of color-blind people discovering color made me something of an expert; I\u2019d be able to tell if Audrey was faking it. I knew she would ham it up, but I\u2019d see through her bullshit, if bullshit there was, and I planned to be an adult about it\u2014not to call her on it and expose her but just to derive satisfaction from knowing that I\u2019d given her something she had no use for. Lino woke from his nap. I told him about ordering the glasses and regretted it immediately\u2014he would tell Audrey, who would have plenty of time to prepare her act, by watching the same videos I had. \u201cI want it to be a surprise,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell her the glasses are coming.\u201d \u201cYou hate surprises,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, this one won\u2019t be for me,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I get the feeling that Audrey might like surprises.\u201d My brother wasn\u2019t an idiot. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend you like her when it\u2019s just me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do try making an effort when she\u2019s in the room, O.K.? That\u2019s all I ask. I think she likes you. She always wished she had a sister. She thinks maybe she had one and they were separated in the adoption.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cWe all wish we\u2019d had different childhoods, all right? I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for her. I wish I\u2019d had a sister, did you know that? Do you find me more interesting as a result of finding this out?\u201d \u201cActually, yes, maybe,\u201d Lino said. \u201cI guess I wished I\u2019d had a brother. Or been an only child.\u201d \u201cWho wishes they were an only child?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m joking. Just trying to point out that whatever we fantasized about as children doesn\u2019t hold a candle to what an orphan wished for. It\u2019s just not the same. We knew where we came from, our fantasies were for fun, they never really hurt. We always went downstairs for dinner when Mommy called. We could experience both the fantasy of being someone else and the reality of knowing our biological family. We had more options.\u201d \u201cBut why would more necessarily be better? I mean, the orphan who doesn\u2019t know anything about his birth parents\u2014who is he to claim that knowing is better? He\u2019s never experienced the knowing, after all, the way we haven\u2019t experienced orphanhood, so how can he say it\u2019s superior? Why not let us who\u2019ve had that experience decide?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d That was a bit of a compliment, in his mouth, so I went on. \u201cMany people wish they\u2019d grown up orphans, for the perks\u2014we just don\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d \u201cThe perks?\u201d \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s even an orphan?\u201d We\u2019d been whispering this whole time, but Lino went back to his full voice to say the next thing. \u201cMaybe you should start smoking again\u201d was what he said, at which moment Audrey walked into the living room. \u201cJeanne!\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea you\u2019d been a smoker\u2014your skin is so radiant! Congratulations on quitting! Isn\u2019t it so hard? My father, when he quit, he was a real mess.\u201d \u201cShe is a real mess,\u201d Lino said. \u201cJeanne is usually much nicer than what you\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d I was actually touched by that. I wasn\u2019t sure if Lino believed it, or if he was just making excuses for me, but still. Making excuses for someone was proof you liked them. \u201cIt is very hard,\u201d I told Audrey. \u201cThank you for asking. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a little on edge these days.\u201d \u201cOne day at a time,\u201d she said.", "I clicked on Track My Package a dozen times in the next few hours, then again the following morning. The glasses had made it to Madrid overnight. They would be Audrey\u2019s by tomorrow. At the Delf\u00edn, I asked the waiter how things were, and he said that he was constipado, which I thought was a little more than I needed to know, until he explained that being constipado, in Spanish, meant having a cold. I told him that I had ordered the glasses for my brother\u2019s dalt\u00f3nica girlfriend, and he thought that this was very thoughtful. Said that he would love to see it when she wore them for the first time. \u201cWe could have a show right here on the terrace,\u201d he offered. \u201cA party.\u201d I said that would be nice. My phone rang, and it was a certain Clara, from the director\u2019s office at summer camp. I was told that Marion had beaten up another girl, a fourteen-year-old. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why,\u201d Clara said. \u201cThe kid\u2019s in the hospital, with a broken nose and a concussion. They\u2019re going to keep her under observation for the day.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time that Marion had hit someone (she\u2019d beaten up a boy the previous winter, for calling her \u201cboxy\u201d), but she\u2019d never broken bones before. \u201cDid they fight this morning or last night?\u201d I asked, somehow thinking that it made a difference. I guess it did, or I guess I thought it did\u2014that hitting someone first thing in the morning was perhaps worse, a sign of terminal anger, one that eight hours of sleep hadn\u2019t been able to tamp down to allow the new day a chance not to suck. \u201cIt was this morning at breakfast,\u201d Clara said. \u201cYou have to come pick her up as soon as possible. We cannot keep her here with us.\u201d I said I understood. Hanging up, I realized that my main takeaway from the phone call was surprise at not having been called sooner about something that Marion had done. It meant that she\u2019d been trying hard to behave. She\u2019d promised me she\u2019d try, and Marion didn\u2019t promise things lightly, just to defuse or prevent arguments. She loved arguing. I knew that she\u2019d tried, and also that I could never congratulate her for trying, because she had to learn that trying was not enough. I decided to lie to my parents and tell them that Marion was the one who\u2019d ended up in the hospital, with a tonsil infection. They didn\u2019t need to know. Rather, I didn\u2019t need to interpret their silent judgment of the man I\u2019d picked to be Marion\u2019s father. That I was twenty-three at the time didn\u2019t sound like a good excuse anymore, now that Audrey had entered our lives, a trilingual professional young woman in her twenties with a good head on her shoulders and excellent taste in men. Of course she and Lino would have a daughter. She would have a name like C\u00e9lestine, or Zoya. Audrey would worry for a while that the girl was color-blind, but she would turn out to be perfect. I watched Audrey shake the sand off her towel. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but she would go back to America with sand in her luggage that would never leave her. Even I brought some home with me every time. Books I never took to the beach still managed to trap sand in their spines; the sand then found its way to our couch; Marion then complained about it irritating her sensitive skin. I wondered if Audrey ever thought about all the kids in the orphanage who hadn\u2019t been picked. That\u2019s what I would\u2019ve obsessed about in her place, not my biological parents.", "An hour later, I was at the airport, too early for my flight. I kept forgetting that, when you didn\u2019t smoke, you didn\u2019t have to build time around meetings and train rides for a final cigarette, or stand in front of bars and doctors\u2019 offices while you took your last puffs. You could just go in. At Orly, everyone looked disappointed. Or mad. Even the lovers who\u2019d just been reunited looked mad\u2014mad at the weight of the suitcase, mad that he hadn\u2019t brought flowers, mad at an underwhelming reality. Marion\u2019s camp was in Normandy, so I still had a bus and a train to catch. I bought a pack of cigarettes at Gare Montparnasse. No one was going to care if I started smoking again, except maybe Audrey. I was the only customer, and the cashier resented me for disturbing her phone conversation. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that you lack privacy in your place of work,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she said, away from the receiver. I said I hoped she was having a nice day. She was framed by trashy magazines, and the cover of one informed me that Marion\u2019s father was single again. Who could possibly care, I wondered, who still cared? It had to stop, at some point. The reality-TV show he\u2019d starred on had been off the air for three years. Other shows had taken its place, even more shocking and even more boring ones, with hotter and dumber participants, but Marion\u2019s father was still interesting to some people. They wanted to know if he was happy. He\u2019d seemed so troubled\u2014a bit dickish, yes, but so vulnerable, and honest about his past mistakes . . . the audience had loved that. God, that cigarette was good. If all cigarettes tasted the way one did after three weeks of abstinence, no one would consider quitting, I thought. Oh, really? I berated myself immediately. Things are better when you don\u2019t have them all the time? What a discovery! You should write that down for posterity! Print it on a mug! I smoked a second one. Not as good. Not nearly.", "Marion apologized for punching the girl, but she didn\u2019t mean it. She was glad about the punch, only sorry that it had had consequences. Cartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian Boothby \u201cWhat are we going to do with you?\u201d I said. Marion didn\u2019t do rhetorical questions. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll send me to another shrink,\u201d she said. She could have made excuses, her father being a loser who\u2019d abandoned her before she could even say a word, but she never played that card. She vaguely knew about the show\u2014that her father had confessed to another cast member, on camera, that he hadn\u2019t seen his daughter in years and felt lousy about it. I\u2019d got several calls from production after that, asking if I would consider bringing Marion to the set for a reunion on live TV, and I\u2019d said no. When they insisted, I talked to Marion about it, and she confirmed that she wasn\u2019t interested. She thought he was an idiot. I said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s an idiot for not having spent the past nine years with you,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo, he\u2019s an idiot because he thinks that Lebanon and Libya are the same country,\u201d which indicated that she\u2019d actually watched a few episodes. When production insisted some more, I told them to feel free to pass our number on to Marion\u2019s father, if he wanted to reconnect off camera. He never got in touch.", "We rode back to Paris in silence, Marion reading her comics, me looking at her reflection in the train window. On the M\u00e9tro back to the apartment, I received a video from Lino. The glasses had arrived in Almer\u00eda an hour before, and they were all having a party at the Delf\u00edn to celebrate. Audrey had insisted that my brother film her putting the glasses on for the first time so that I could share this moment with them. Night was falling in Paris, and men and women on the M\u00e9tro looked concerned, or angry at themselves for not accomplishing what they\u2019d hoped to accomplish before sunset. Almer\u00eda, the video reminded me, though in the same time zone, still had a good hour of daylight ahead, and that seemed enough to keep all hopes up. Audrey didn\u2019t want to wait for the sunset or anything special to try on the glasses: she wanted her first moment in full color to be a random one, and to measure all beauty from there. The first thing she looked at was my brother, and she couldn\u2019t believe it\u2014she kept touching his shirt, his skin, his face. Then she looked at her tapas, the beach, the sea. Faking it or not\u2014it seemed like she wasn\u2019t\u2014she looked more joyful than I\u2019d ever been. Or than I\u2019d ever seen Marion be. I showed her the video. \u201cThat\u2019s Lino\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s color-blind.\u201d To my surprise, Marion found the fact worthy of interest. To my surprise and relief, I should say. You don\u2019t always want to see yourself in your children. Children are no idiots\u2014they see it, too, and they resent you for making them in your image. She watched the video with a focus she usually reserved for scientific experiments. \u201cShe looks too happy to be interesting\u201d was her conclusion. She handed back the phone. \u201cShe was adopted,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s not happy.\u201d Marion looked at the video again and shrugged. \u201cMaybe now that she sees colors she\u2019ll dress a little better,\u201d she said. Now was perhaps not the moment to give her the purple friendship bracelet Audrey had bought for her. She would deem it ugly, I knew, ugly as the Eiffel Tower. \u201cHas my grandfather gotten any better at chess?\u201d she asked. I just smiled, I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t know anything about chess, or about my father, in the end. I\u2019d been in transit all day, in the sky and now underground, alone and now with her. Our suitcases stood upright on their wheels and swayed in front of us, threatened to tip over with every stop and turn, but Marion didn\u2019t seem to worry that hers might fall, hit someone\u2019s knees, break open. She didn\u2019t pretend to attempt to steady it by resting a hand on the handle, so I put one hand on each suitcase. What was so stupid about castling? I wondered. Why couldn\u2019t she have given my father a break about it? Why couldn\u2019t she give anyone a break, not hit them, hold her own suitcase? I realized I hadn\u2019t asked her what the girl had done to deserve the blow.", "When we got home, there was a message from Clara, and I feared that the girl had taken a turn for the worse, that the broken bone in her nose had perforated an eye, dug into her brain, or paralyzed her, but the message was from earlier that morning, before Clara had reached me on my cell phone, when my main concern had been to expose Audrey\u2019s lie in front of those who loved her. I texted my brother to see how life in color was treating his girlfriend. \u201cWe\u2019re watching \u2018Grease\u2019 in Spanish,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe says she\u2019s never taking the glasses off.\u201d \u201c \u2018Grease\u2019?\u201d I texted back. \u201cHer favorite movie.\u201d I wondered how one could like the movie \u201cGrease\u201d if one didn\u2019t know the color pink. \u201cThank you,\u201d my brother added.
