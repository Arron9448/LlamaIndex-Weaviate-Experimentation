Developed as much as a tribute to the days of shipbuilding in the city as in commemoration of the ill-fated liner that met her untimely end on her Maiden Voyage in 1912, Titanic Belfast is a dramatic, innovative and exciting presentation of the real story of the famous ship. Wander through its nine fascinating galleries, housed in one of the most eye-catching buildings to have been built in the UK for years. The ship's conception, construction, tragic sinking and its aftermath, as well as its rediscovery in 1985, are brought vividly to life with audio-visual presentations, life-size reconstructions, interactive features and even a Shipyard Ride. You'll leave the exhibition with a real sense of the enormity - and the human cost - of one of the 20th-century's most fateful events. After a fascinating morning and the opportunity to enjoy lunch (payable locally) this afternoon's guided tour of Belfast will reveal the city's turbulent past, thriving present and hopes for the future. Highlights will include major landmarks such as City Hall, Queen's and Stormont Castle - seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a stunning sight gradually revealed from the rising approach road. During the tour you'll also see West Belfast's celebrated Peace Wall, the political murals of the Shankhill and Falls roads, and the ultra-modern developments of the regenerated docks area, crowned by the breathtaking Titanic Quarter. The rest of the day and evening is left free. Why not soak up the local atmosphere in one of the city centre's traditional pubs?"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["wall", "real", "youll", "tour", "belfast", "experience", "city", "titanic", "wander", "fascinating", "west"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
