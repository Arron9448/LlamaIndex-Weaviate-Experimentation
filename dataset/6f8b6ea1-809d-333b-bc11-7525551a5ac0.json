A more permanent power-grab could in turn be blocked by the Bundesrat, the constitutional body through which the states participate in the legislative process.", "Despite cultural venues, restaurants and leisure facilities having been closed since last November, Germany has been unable to prevent a third wave of the virus, driven by the more infectious B117 variant first discovered in the UK.", "On Friday the Robert Koch Institute, Germany\u2019s disease control agency, reported 25,464 new infections within the past 24 hours, the highest daily rate of the country\u2019s third wave so far. A reporting lag caused by the Easter break means the latest numbers may not yet give an accurate indication of the pandemic\u2019s dynamic.", "But the health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday that reports from hospitals around the country painted an alarming picture, with the number of Covid-19 patients on intensive care beds having risen by 20%, to 4,500, over the course of the past week.", "\u201cIf the trend continues, then that is too many for our health system,\u201d said Spahn.
