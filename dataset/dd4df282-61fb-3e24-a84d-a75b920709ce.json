Earlier that year, they had hosted a birthday party for a friend on Minecraft, the popular and influential open-world video game. The birthday party drew hundreds of guests online. Now Thwip Gang conceived of a more ambitious social experiment: a music festival called Coalchella, a riff on Coachella, also to be held on Minecraft. They booked dozens of musicians, most of them obscure electronic acts, to perform live virtual sets. More than twenty-seven thousand people streamed music from the eight-hour event, which included two digitally rendered stages, a Ferris wheel, and sponsorships from fake brands.", "One of the acts was 100 gecs, an avant-garde electronic duo, composed of Dylan Brady and Laura Les. The pair met as teen-agers in St. Louis, and had cultivated a loose collaboration for several years. At the Minecraft festival, they d\u00e9buted a song called \u201cringtone,\u201d a fitting anthem for a high-concept and low-stakes event taking place inside a video game. Their voices were pitched up to Chipmunk levels, and they sang the chorus, a meditation on smartphones, over a sickly sweet, oversimplified synth melody: \u201cMy boy\u2019s got his own ringtone / It\u2019s the only one I know / It\u2019s the only one I know.\u201d Months later, they performed at another Minecraft music festival, this time with a heftier set of songs, the crown jewel of which was \u201cmoney machine\u201d\u2014a squelching electro-rock track with cartoonishly distorted bass and a nonsensical preamble in which Les calls someone a \u201cpiss baby.\u201d It was the right kind of music to be incubated in virtual reality: silly, uncanny, full of adrenaline, and blithe about mainstream trends.", "These songs are the foundational tracks of 100 gecs\u2019 first album, \u201c1000 gecs,\u201d which was released last summer. It\u2019s a whirlwind record, clocking in at only twenty-three minutes, but it contains a multiverse of references, as well as a deconstruction of those references. To listen to the album is to have as much fun as one can possibly have while receiving an auditory flogging. In the musical scrap yard of \u201c1000 gecs,\u201d anything is fair game, especially modes and styles from history\u2019s refuse pile. The album displays a fondness for unfashionable genres\u2014electroclash, pop-punk, emo rap, dubstep, trance, industrial rock and dance, drum \u2019n\u2019 bass, death metal, chiptune, and even polka\u2014but a hardened allegiance to none. (The use of commonplace hip-hop vocabulary is the only through line to the current pop landscape.)", "100 gecs is not the first group to make hyper-referential, free-form electronic music, of course. Brady and Les are disciples of John Zorn, the prolific experimental composer, who has made chamber music, improvisational jazz, and hardcore punk, sometimes all on the same album. And they exist in the lineage of acts like the Avalanches and Girl Talk, sample-based electronic artists who created connect-the-dots listening experiences using familiar songs. But \u201c1000 gecs\u201d is less a product of nostalgia than of nihilism, an impressively concise maximalist exercise with no rules. It does not capture specific eras so much as it celebrates a history of musical idiosyncrasies, calling to mind the songs of pop music\u2019s strangest one-hit wonders\u2014think Eiffel 65\u2019s \u201cBlue,\u201d Aqua\u2019s \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d and Skrillex\u2019s \u201cScary Monsters and Nice Sprites.\u201d Unlike so many of its predecessors, 100 gecs does not use samples. What sound like glitches are fleeting glimpses of the past.", "As solo artists, Brady and Les have followed more direct impulses, creating wistful, experimental pop and hip-hop. Together, they scramble these impulses into oblivion. It would be tempting to write off 100 gecs as a prank or a fluke if the songs did not have such an eerily resonant emotional core. Brady and Les\u2019s heavily filtered voices express genuine anxiety about love, money, and technology. On \u201cringtone,\u201d they convey the overwhelming feeling of looking at your phone: \u201cForty-five group texts, fifty group D.M.s, send another text askin\u2019 me if I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d This turns to panic on \u201c800db cloud,\u201d a song that alternates between spare, longing whispers and mosh-pit mayhem, including a brief hardcore-style breakdown in which their voices are pitched down to guttural growls. \u201cI might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah,\u201d they sing. In the video for the song, the pair are shown manically headbanging in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre, on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as passersby film them with their phones.", "Part of what makes 100 gecs\u2019 work so exhilarating is that it fulfills conceptual promises made more than a decade ago, when the Internet was beginning to reshape notions of what music could be. Theoretically, people now had access to software and music libraries that would allow them to make whatever style of music they pleased. Artists, it was believed, would surely take more liberties, and pop music would become stranger, bolder, and more whimsical. That isn\u2019t quite what ended up happening. Instead, the dominance of streaming services created a marketplace that rewarded conformity\u2014it\u2019s easier to keep people listening to a playlist when everything on it sounds pretty much the same. That\u2019s why even music classified as \u201cindependent\u201d or \u201cgenre-defiant\u201d has come to sound like easy listening. 100 gecs is a jarring antidote to this trend."], "authors": ["Carrie Battan", "Luke Mogelson", "Jia Tolentino", "Alex Ross", "Erik Agard", "Elizabeth Flock", "Kelefa Sanneh", "Hua Hsu"], "keywords": ["songs", "musical", "brady", "minecraft", "scrap", "gecs", "music", "les", "electronic", "pop", "100", "album", "yard"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
