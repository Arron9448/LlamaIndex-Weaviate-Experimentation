I\u2019d rather have a guy who is a seven as a player and a 10 as a man than someone who has a 10-rating as a player and five as a man.\u201d", "A lot has happened to Conte since he gave that interview. He has been in charge of Juventus, Italy and Chelsea. He has won three scudettos, one Premier League title and one FA Cup and taken Italy to the quarter-finals of the Euros. Yet as far as his squad-building approach is concerned, nothing has changed.", "Mario Balotelli melts hearts on his scoring return to Naples with Brescia | Nicky Bandini Read more", "Conte is back in Italy with Inter this season and the way he went about creating the squad he wanted for the 2019-20 season was bordering on the brutal. Radja Nainggolan may have scored the goal that ensured Champions League qualification for Inter but he was soon on his way to Cagliari, two years after being bought for \u00a333m. Mauro Icardi was without a doubt the team\u2019s best striker but he was loaned out to Paris St-Germain while another attacking asset, Ivan Perisic, was sent to Bayern Munich, also on a season-long loan.", "The manager then spent most of his money, \u00a370m, on Romelu Lukaku but also added players such as Diego God\u00edn, Nicol\u00f2 Barella, Stefano Sensi, Valentino Lazaro and, rather surprisingly, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, on loan from Manchester United.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Antonio Conte has won his first six league games with Inter, deploying a solid three-man midfield behind Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. Photograph: The Guardian", "The results have been extraordinary. Inter have raced out of the blocks, winning all their six league games to sit two points clear of Juventus, whom they face on Sunday in the most anticipated game in Serie A for quite some time. The fact that Conte is up against Maurizio Sarri only adds to the lustre.", "Conte and Sarri are neither friends nor enemies. There is respect but also a bit of needle. Sarri is Conte\u2019s senior by 10 years but despite both of them having coached mainly in Italy they have rarely crossed paths. There was the bizarre season at Arezzo in 2006 when Conte was first replaced by Sarri and Sarri was then replaced by the returning Conte but since then they have been mainly kept apart.", "Sarri, of course, succeeded Conte at Chelsea, hailing his predecessor as an \u201cextraordinary coach\u201d but they clashed early on this season when Sarri had complained about having to play Atalanta in \u201cthe mid-afternoon heat\u201d, to which Conte responded by saying that he did not want to comment, adding \u201cotherwise we\u2019ll have to start comparing balance sheets and financial resources. Someone [Sarri] should calm down, as he\u2019s on the powerful side now\u201d.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stefano Sensi has been a revelation at the heart of Inter\u2019s midfield. Photograph: Jennifer Lorenzini/Reuters", "The last was a reference to all those years when Sarri was managing Empoli and Napoli and was often complaining about Juventus\u2019 financial might. Now he is the man in charge of the record champions and while he has not had the 100% start Conte has, he travels to Milan with his side having picked up five wins and a draw so far.", "Tactically the game will be a fascinating spectacle. It is Conte\u2019s 3-5-2 against Sarri\u2019s 4-3-1-2 (yes, he has abandoned 4-3-3 for the time being). Will Inter\u2019s three-man defence cope with the strength and power of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn? Can Aaron Ramsey find the pockets of space behind Marcelo Brozovic? And how much defending will be done as on the flank where Inter\u2019s Kwadwo Asamoah is likely to take on Juve\u2019s makeshift right-back Juan Cuadrado?", "Inter\u2019s defence has been in spectacular form, conceding only two goals in the six league games, using the 3-5-2 system Conte implemented at the start of the season. The three centre-backs, God\u00edn, Stefan de Vrij and Milan \u0160kriniar have excelled while the way Inter\u2019s midfield has dominated games this season has been the real surprise.", "There are no star names as such but Conte has found a superb mix between industry and artistry in the middle with Danilo D\u2019Ambrosio (or Antonio Candreva) and Kwadwo Asamoah, a former Juve player, on the wings and Barella (the N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 of the team), Stefano Sensi and Marcelo Brozovic centrally. Lukaku, if he recovers from the injury that kept him out of the 2-1 defeat at Barcelona on Wednesday, will be partnered by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez up front.", "Inter feel like the more settled side going into the game but Sarri\u2019s Juve are getting there too. After a difficult beginning in which the manager was ill for three weeks and he lost player after player to injury (Giorgio Chiellini, Douglas Costa, Danilo and Mattia De Sciglio to name a few) they have slowly recovered. The 60-year-old started the season playing his favoured 4-3-3 formation with Douglas Costa, Higua\u00edn and Ronaldo up front but after the Brazilian\u2019s injury and the return to fitness of Ramsey he has settled on the 4-3-1-2 to good effect.", "The defence is also coming good at the right time. At the start of the season they gave away far too many cheap goals, partly explained by Chiellini\u2019s absence and Matthijs De Ligt\u2019s unsteady start, but they are now approaching the kind of stability one would expect from a Juve defence.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Maurizio Sarri has deviated from his favoured 4-3-3 formation, playing Gonzalo Higua\u00edn alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. Photograph: The Guardian", "Serie A has yet to see much of Sarri-ball though, the style that dominated the manager\u2019s time at Napoli and reared its head at Chelsea at times. The feeling is that this is still a team that is finding its feet under a new manager, the quality of the individuals ensuring that they are winning games when they, at times, have been way below their best.", "On Sunday, the game may, as so often is the case, be decided in central midfield. Conte is sure to ask Sensi to press on Juve\u2019s Miralem Pjanic, Sarri\u2019s regista. The Juventus manager wants Pjanic to have at least 150 touches in a game and the Bosnian\u2019s sublime technique normally means that he can deal with everything that is thrown at him but Sensi could potentially trouble him.", "Sensi has been the revelation of the season so far, being able to play as the regista and a No 10, sometimes switching between the two roles in the same game. The 24-year-old gives Inter an effervescence and creativity that has been missing in recent years.", "He is also the perfect example of what has happened to Inter since Conte took over. Everywhere you see the manager\u2019s philosophy: in the way the team play, in the way they work, the way they run and even on the players\u2019 faces.", "Sunday\u2019s game promises to be an almighty battle. Juventus have the better players but sometimes that is not enough."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
