He left work to buy a kitchen knife and oyster knife and returned to kill four colleagues and injure two others, slitting the throat of at least one victim. The attack is being investigated as a terrorist incident.", "The attacker, Micka\u00ebl Harpon, who was shot dead at the scene, was a 45-year-old computer expert.
