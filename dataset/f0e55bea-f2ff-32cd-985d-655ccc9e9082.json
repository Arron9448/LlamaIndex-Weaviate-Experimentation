Those who have already fallen in love with the Bergson family's epic journey can check out the game's biggest update yet. It\u2019s called Family Trials, and guess what? It\u2019s available now and free to all players.", "Family Trials is a separate mode independent of the main story campaign. It adds a new dungeon called Zyklus that, like a lot of places in Children of Morta, is riddled with Corruption. In this case, the malevolent force regularly alters the rules within Zyklus, meaning its levels will be randomized on each run.", "You\u2019ll have one shot to take your chosen Bergson family member, all of whom are available from the start with their active abilities, through floors teeming with enemy hordes. In addition to main goals, you\u2019ll have side objectives as well. Be careful, though; dying causes you to lose nearly all of your progress. But if that\u2019s not daunting enough for you, Family Trials adds two new difficulty options: Hard and Insane. The higher the difficulty, the more levels you\u2019ll have to conquer.", "A new talent system replaces the existing skill tree. When characters level up, they get to choose a new talent, and each Bergson has 40 talents each. Upgrades and mods for skills can be stacked and tinkered with, so you can experiment with different character builds. Runes no longer drop in dungeons either, instead becoming part of the talent system.", "Divine Relics and Divine Graces gain two more power tiers, which can be upgraded in the shop. Speaking of the shop, Gem shards function as the store\u2019s main currency now. You can earn additional rewards by completing in-game deeds, which can give you a leg-up at the start of a run by granting extra HP or an instant level up. You also find items that will upgrade your stats and bestow special traits.", "Family Trials looks like a hefty update and presents a new way to enjoy an already stellar experience. We scored Children of Morta 9 out of 10, and developer Dead Mage has continued to support the game since it launched in October 2019. If you haven\u2019t kept up with Children of Morta beyond the main story, you can catch up on its previous updates: Setting Sun Inn and the charity-focused Paws and Claws DLC.", "What do you think of Family Trials?
