I\u2019m a proud Georgian. I think one thing that really bothers me about this is that I felt like maybe not sports, but baseball especially, was that last thing we had down here in this state after such a tumultuous election season. I don\u2019t know if you know about baseball and the Braves footprint, but the closest stadium to us is Cincinnati. We\u2019ve got D.C., Cincinnati, St. Louis and Tampa Bay and we\u2019re everything in between. This is not just a hit against Georgia. This is a hit against several states and a huge fan base. It\u2019s just terrible that MLB would really prioritize such a small, loud group of people over such a large fan base.\u201d", "\u201cThese are laws that challenged every problem you could possibly say we had and say we\u2019re going to fix it. And to say that\u2019s Jim Crow on steroids is not just lying. It\u2019s being a provocateur. It\u2019s not letting a crisis go to waste. It is being divisive and trying to get people to hate each other for the purpose of scoring political points. And he should be ashamed, but he doesn\u2019t have the cognitive ability to understand shame, or he wouldn\u2019t say his son did nothing wrong.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["thing", "georgian", "lying", "steroids", "crow", "joey", "johnny", "jim", "hit", "fox", "state", "laws", "georgia", "getting", "really", "say", "hate", "know", "saying", "jones"], "pubDate": "2021-04-07T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
