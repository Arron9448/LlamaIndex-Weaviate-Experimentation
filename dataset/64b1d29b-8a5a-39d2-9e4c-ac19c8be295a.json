I also consult and advice startups, large multinationals as well as government organizations on issues around innovation and networks.", "My current research investigates how new ideas and innovations are developed in networks and communities. The ongoing projects use large-scale analysis of networks, and I try to integrate that with a deeper appreciation for what content flows through networks. I work with some awesome people around the world, and I shouldn't take credit for all of it.", "My research has been published in the Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Organization Science, Strategic Management Journal among others. I have a Google Scholar profile and a Researcher ID where you can trace my citations, and new work. I also upload my published papers to ResearchGate, but I should clearly be more disciplined about uploading working papers. Send an e-mail if you would like a copy of my papers.", "I currently serve as an Associate Editor for the Academy of Management Journal, where I handle manuscripts on innovation, networks and organization theory.", "I do my best to update my LinkedIn profile and respond to requests.
