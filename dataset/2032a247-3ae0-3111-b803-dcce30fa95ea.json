James Comer (R-KY) described what it was like on the House floor when protestors stormed the Capitol and responded to the breaking news of Speaker Nancy Pelosi asking for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.", "\"It was surreal. I was in the House when all that happened. What sounded like a gunshot right outside the back door of the House, but you never know because it echoes in the Capitol. And then I saw the glass fly through the front door and we didn't know if that was a gunshot or what, but it was something you wouldn't expect to see debating an important historical piece of legislation on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.\"", "\"Of course it's a stunt. And let me make sure all the listeners know I proudly voted against Nancy Pelosi for Speaker this week. They've harassed Donald Trump from the day he arrived in Washington. And it looks like they're going to do it until the day he leaves Washington. Now, I think that he could have handled some things a little better yesterday, I think that he probably should have addressed the nation last night. But I mean, he's got two weeks left. He made the announcement yesterday that there would be a peaceful transition of power. So I think that the first thing Pelosi needs to focus on is trying to unite Americans with the lack of confidence with the voting. And that's terrible in a democracy. She also needs to tighten up the security in the Capitol. I mean, what a security breach to be able to have that many people go in there. So she's got a lot of problems. She needs to focus. She needs to worry about her job as Speaker. The last two years that she's been Speaker, I can't tell you what her agenda is other than to bash Donald Trump. She's got two more weeks of that and then she's going to have to somewhat try to govern and I'm going to be interested to see in what what her policies are going to be, because over the last two years she's been Speaker and since I've been in Congress, it's all been just bashing Donald Trump and bashing Republicans, and it's just been real frustrating that unfortunately elections have consequences, and she got reelected Speaker this week. So we're going to have to put up with her for two more years.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["think", "nation", "amendment", "going", "shes", "rep", "speaker", "know", "james", "rky", "comer", "donald", "pelosi", "trump", "talk", "needs", "stunt", "addressed", "house"], "pubDate": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
