We are talking over Zoom, and she\u2019s dressed in a deep brown blazer and black pearls, sitting in front of not one but two American flags, on a week in which she and Biden have begun naming their Cabinet. She wanted to say something that night that young Americans would remember. \u201cI always say this: I may be the first to do many things\u2014make sure I\u2019m not the last,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was thinking of my baby nieces, who will only know one world where a woman is vice president of the United States, a woman of color, a Black woman, a woman with parents who were born outside of the United States.\u201d Harris was also emotional that night, thinking of her mother, an Indian immigrant and breast cancer researcher named Shyamala Gopalan who passed away 12 years ago. \u201cI thought about what her life meant\u201d and how it had gotten Harris to that victory. And she was thinking about the weight on her and Biden \u201cto unify our country and to heal.\u201d", "A FEW WEEKS before our interview, on November 2, I followed Harris around the state of Pennsylvania. In the city of Bethlehem, sunken into the green-lit farmland of the Lehigh Valley, Harris was holding a drive-up rally to ignite a furiously long day of campaigning. Pennsylvania was a key swing state that had gone Trump\u2019s way in 2016. It\u2019s also a place where people care deeply about the land, about who has long lived on the land, and who is moving in, and about how to protect the values they believe the land represents: family, honorable work, a sense of home. The press pool and I watched her take the stage in front of young families; white men, including a group of metal\u00adworker-union members in neon-yellow sweatshirts; and middle-aged Black girlfriends in bright jackets.", "\u201cI was feeling that there\u2019s not much more we can do,\u201d Harris recalls of that day in Pennsylvania. \u201cBut because I had been going to states like Florida and North Carolina during early voting, I was feeling a sense of joy in seeing how many people were voting.\u201d The hours-long voting lines around the country, to her, showed what she had always felt about American democracy: that it was only as strong as the people willing to fight for it. To others the lines were troubling, demonstrating state attempts at voter suppression, but to Harris, they also suggested love for our country, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the worst economic conditions Americans had experienced in generations."], "authors": ["Alexis Okeowo", "Alexis Okeow", "Tyler Mitchel"], "keywords": ["presidentelect", "pennsylvania", "land", "road", "states", "vice", "ahead", "voting", "thinking", "state", "night", "country", "woman", "harris", "kamala"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
