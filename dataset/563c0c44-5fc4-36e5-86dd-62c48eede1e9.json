Thanks for having us.", "Sure, sure.", "Steve and Dee, you are on a boat.", "And I bring that up a bit 'cause it's relevant.", "Last time we talked a few months ago,", "you were in a caravan in the Scottish countryside,", "and I could hear sheep in the background.", "[Steve] Yes.", "You're globetrotters for very good reasons", "because of what you're studying.", "Walk us through what you're doing out there", "on boats and in caravans.", "Well, we survived the initial COVID", "lockdown in a caravan at a friend's place", "with many, many sheep,", "and now we've returned to the middle of France", "on the Rhine river on our boat,", "just waiting for all the madness to stop", "so we can carry on with our research.", "So what is it?", "So what is microplastic?", "How do you define that?", "And I think this is a good way to start", "to talk about your research.", "Where are you finding these tiny bits of plastic?", "Everywhere. [laughing]", "So our research focuses on atmospherics.", "We went about looking up in the air", "purely because we found plastics in the oceans.", "Plastics has been found in the rivers,", "in the river sediment, it's being found in soil.", "And we're still not finding that mass balance", "equality in the plastics that we would expect.", "So we have an idea of how much is being thrown out,", "how much is being lost out of the waste management system.", "But we don't know where that that missing gap is", "between the amount that we know", "is actually being put to waste", "and the amount that's being produced, there's a gap.", "So it's a leaky system.", "We don't have a circular economy.", "And we want to know where all of that plastic has gone.", "And the last environmental compartment", "to look at is the atmosphere.", "So we started looking up in the atmosphere,", "well, in the air, that's floating around you all the time.", "We started in France and we've sort of moved globally", "to identify where these microplastics might be.", "Microplastic is a slightly contentious term.", "It depends on who you talk to as to what size it is.", "It's basically anything that's under", "five millimeters in size,", "all the way down to one micron", "and then below one micron is a nanometer,", "which is a nanoplastic.", "So that's not a medical definition,", "that's a scientific definition.", "Yeah, yeah, and you know,", "you're finding these tiny bits of plastics", "on remote mountaintops, and it's very clear", "that this is blowing in the wind,", "and it's also blowing up into the Arctic.", "It has been found in formerly pristine areas up there.", "And I think that brings us nicely", "to Isla's research, also looking at the Arctic.", "But looking at some really troubling things", "when it comes to the climate change.", "Given the fact that the Arctic is warming twice,", "if not more, faster than the rest of the planet.", "So Isla, maybe just introduce your research here.", "And I understand you actually have some new research", "that came out this week that you could share.", "Excellent, yeah.", "so I work in the Arctic, and normal summers,", "I'm actually up in the Arctic.", "For the last, or,", "I would have been for the last few months,", "collecting our field research.", "This summer has been a bit different,", "but the research continues,", "this time more at the computer.", "So I work in the Canadian Arctic,", "and I work with datasets around the Arctic.", "And what we're seeing is this greening of tundra ecosystem.", "So you have the climate warming over the last few decades.", "And what we've been doing is monitoring plants", "on the ground and from the air", "using drones and with my research team,", "which is called Team Shrub, tracking this change", "that's going on in the high latitudes of the planet.", "And so we're using fixed wing plane drones,", "we're using the multi copter drones,", "some of the same types of drone platforms", "that you could buy commercially or fly yourself.", "And then we're monitoring these vast tundra landscapes", "that have this green surface of plants at the top.", "And what we're seeing from space", "and satellite is this greening pattern.", "And what we're trying to figure out on the ground", "is exactly what that greeting signal means", "in terms of a change on the ground,", "and what that means for the carbon cycle,", "which is all a part of this global climate system.", "And whether basically warming in the Arctic", "is going to amplify the climate change", "that we see across the planet.", "Yeah, a couple of things that I want to follow up on.", "Greening sounds nice, generally speaking,", "but that is not the case in the Arctic.", "I was hoping you could follow up", "on a couple of maybe some knock on effects", "that we might be seeing ecologically,", "you know, both in the Arctic itself,", "but looking at Earth as an Earth system,", "how might the greening of the Arctic", "then further feed into these patterns of climate change?", "Yeah, so the vegetation we're seeing,", "vegetation changes in the Arctic", "is an increase in the plants.", "So you're up above the tree line", "and where you are in the Arctic,", "we have different species that are sort of", "shorter than trees, but growing taller over time.", "So we've got these shrubs in the system,", "the woody plants that are kind of the trees in the tundra,", "and then also grasses and other species", "that can benefit when the temperatures are warmer", "and the growing seasons are longer.", "So we think that's what's causing", "climate change in these systems.", "And that's kind of the theme of the new paper", "that you mentioned before that came out yesterday.", "We were working with higher resolution satellite data", "and comparing that to change on the ground", "and also the warming patterns that we've seen in the Arctic.", "And in that paper, we found that yeah,", "over 30% of the Arctic is greening,", "so it is a really pervasive signal.", "And we think that in some cases", "that's trapping more carbon in the planet,", "but it's also changing the Arctic in different ways.", "So one way is as those shrubs tend to get taller,", "that traps more snow in the winter,", "and snow acts like a blanket in these systems,", "and it insulates the ground from the cold temperatures", "in the air in the wintertime.", "So it's kind of like on a cold winter day,", "if you put an extra blanket on your bed, you're warmer.", "And that's a problem, 'cause we don't really want", "the soil to be warmer in these systems,", "because that allows microbes", "to keep munching away on the carbon that's in there.", "It allows the permafrost,", "which is the permanently frozen ground,", "to stay warmer in the winter,", "which means that in the summer,", "it thaws to a deeper level", "and all of that could potentially", "be releasing carbon into the atmosphere.", "So what we're concerned about in these systems", "as the vegetation increases", "is that we might be seeing some positive feedbacks", "that are going to release carbon to the atmosphere.", "And there's quite a lot of carbon.", "So I was trying to look up exactly how much carbon", "we're talking about in these high latitude systems.", "And it's somewhere between 1000 and 2000 petagrams", "of carbon, which NASA put out in this example.", "So that's, if you imagine a coal train", "and each of those coal train has these cars full of coal", "and the coal is mostly carbon, the train would be,", "I think something like 200,000 miles long,", "that's the amount of carbon that's in", "the high latitudes that could be released to the atmosphere.", "So if it was released, then that could as much as double", "the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, possibly more,", "and that would create this feedback that means", "greater warming, not just in the Arctic,", "but for the planet as a whole.", "So the Arctic's warmed by about two degrees already,", "and we're expecting it to warm by six to 10 degrees", "over the next 100 years, maybe more.", "So all of these feedbacks and this change,", "it's already happening up there,", "and we're just trying to figure out", "how fast and what it'll mean", "for all of us on the planet. Yeah.", "Yeah, and speaking of feedback, Steve and Dee,", "I think your research is particularly fascinating", "because you're covering so much", "of what we're starting to call the microplastic cycle,", "the way that these particles are moving", "between land and sea and air.", "You know, kind of building off some of the stuff", "that I was talking about,", "these global systems that are all interconnected,", "I was hoping you could speak to", "what we're learning about this microplastic cycle,", "how these little bits of plastic", "are actually moving around the planet.", "Yeah, I think we often forget", "that we live on a ball,", "and that ball is inside a bubble.", "So there are no borders,", "nature doesn't see borders,", "and certainly pollution doesn't.", "So whatever we do in one area affects everybody else.", "And plastic is a prime example of covering long distances.", "We're still looking for the sources at the moment,", "we're doing a lot of work on trying to pinpoint that", "so that we can try and mitigate the problem.", "But yeah, as Isla was mentioning,", "the amount of carbon in the atmosphere", "is having an effect on the Arctic Circle.", "And plastic of course, is a producer of carbon.", "The whole process, the whole lifecycle of plastic", "from taking the fracking gas out of the ground,", "turning into ethylene,", "from there all the way through to landfill.", "And this imaginary recycling,", "where it's actually just being shipped off", "to places like Malaysia,", "where they either chop it up", "and burn it or put it straight in the river.", "It's all, every step along that route", "is adding to the carbon footprint,", "but it's also adding to the points", "where it can leak out into the environment.", "And that's where we're finding it in the very,", "very small material. So part of the work", "that we do looks at how far it transports.", "And so we can find where these particles", "are arriving in the world.", "So we've got samples from Africa, from France.", "We've got some samples from the Arctic, we've got places,", "we've got air samples from all over the world.", "And everywhere you look, you find plastic.", "Though we haven't found a sample that doesn't", "have any atmospheric plastic.", "And what do you find falling down to the ground", "and what you find blowing through the air", "are slightly different,", "so they are a slightly different particle size.", "They have slightly different dynamics and shapes", "and the types of material that they are.", "But what we can do is when we know those quantities", "and we know where we found them,", "we can then model where this material goes.", "So you do a back trajectory model and look at its history,", "and if your samples are taken in the right way,", "you can actually create a map saying,", "I caught this sample on this location.", "So we know that there's pieces of plastic", "that we potentially are breathing in,", "that are on this location.", "So they're getting into the ecosystems", "and then they're getting into lungs", "and things like that in this location.", "I've taken that sample on that day.", "I can then map back where it's traveled", "through time in the air,", "and then where it came from potentially.", "So there is moving forward.", "It's a way of not finger pointing,", "but like identifying the key sources", "that can be the major contributors", "to what this atmospheric plastic is.", "Yeah, yeah.", "I wanted to ask about this.", "And I actually got a question from a watcher", "of the series here,", "that I think I just might as well kick to, from Laura Tate.", "She was wondering, I think both of you", "can answer this, it's big enough on a planetary scale.", "Is it too late to save the planet?", "If not, what are the top three things", "we can do to stop the destruction of Earth", "for our future generations?", "We're closing out here on a couple of last minutes.", "I hope we can end on a bright note in that way.", "I hope we can!", "We're not gonna give up hope, we're gonna try.", "Yeah, I think-- I--", "Go ahead.", "[stammering]", "[laughing]", "For plastics, there are some basic things we can do.", "We use an enormous amount of single-use plastic.", "If you think about and evaluate the plastic", "that you use on a daily basis", "in a different way,", "so you identify this as a very high value resource,", "not something that you use for a single purpose,", "and then dispose of.", "If you stop using things in such a linear economy,", "so you take it, you use it, you throw it,", "then there is a potential to have a substantial reduction", "on the amount of plastic pollution", "that we could have in this world.", "It requires an awful lot of change", "in the way that we create and we manage our plastic,", "but there is positive things that you can do towards it.", "Unfortunately, the very small pieces of plastic", "we have in our environment we can't collect.", "There is no mechanism for us to filter the air", "in the world and take all the plastic back out.", "So what's there, we have to figure out", "the damage it's doing and the impact it's having,", "and how not to create more.", "But we can't take that away, unfortunately.", "And the same is sort of true", "for the climate side of the equation.", "So this is a really big global problem.", "And each of us as individuals is playing a part in that.", "So we can lower our own carbon footprints", "and as scientists, we can document the change", "that's going on,", "but we also need to work together as a planet,", "as different countries and encourage our policy makers", "to really think about enacting meaningful change,", "reducing carbon emissions.", "And part of our response as the climate changes", "is just to adapt ourselves", "and try to help these ecosystems along", "as they adapt to these warmer conditions.", "So the Arctic is changing, it's already changed,", "but that doesn't mean that it's going to necessarily", "change in ways that it'll be unrecognizable", "in the future, but it could be different.", "And we might need to sort of adapt and deal", "with that new, different Arctic,", "and that new, different climate system in the future.", "Hmm, wait, sorry.", "Two minutes left.", "Just a quick, last question,", "building off a little bit of that.", "We hear a lot about things that we can personally do", "when it comes to climate change and plastic pollution,", "but neither of those are our problems as individuals.", "There are corporations that have done this", "to a large degree, just very briefly.", "If all three of you might be able", "to talk about that context.", "Yes, we can do things individually,", "but we need to put pressure on the bigger forces here.", "Yeah, I think the first thing you can do is your vote.", "We need to influence the people who have the power", "to make the changes.", "Individually, we can do small things to,", "you know, lessen our plastic use,", "but really it's got to come from the top.", "We need solid policy change.", "Plastic bag bans and straw bans do not go far enough.", "We need complete revolution", "in the plastic industry for a start.", "Labeling needs to be honest,", "bio-plastics we need to prove they're safe", "before they let them out, things like that.", "But really it's your vote, contact your politician,", "tell them that you care about this issue.", "And just building on that,", "educate yourself about the issues.", "Find out about the Arctic, other parts of the planet.", "Find out the changes that different peoples", "around the world are experiencing,", "and share that information.", "And maybe choose different purchases,", "you can try to buy local,", "think about the food you eat", "and the traveling you're doing", "and try and yeah, limit your own impact on the planet", "while sharing sort of the changes that are going on", "and what we as a society can do.", "So, and I agree, definitely get out and vote.", "Okay, I feel like we did the best", "we could ending this on a rosy note,", "given the size of these problems.", "But thanks to all three of you for being here.", "If any of the viewers are interested in their research,", "I've written extensively about both of the groups here.", "It's fascinating stuff,", "and we'll of course be covering", "what you're doing into the future.", "So have fun sailing around
