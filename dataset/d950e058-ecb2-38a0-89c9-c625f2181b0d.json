And guess what? You got a couple of Democrats, who play the Jim Crow game, trying to walk it back in Atlanta saying maybe not boycott. I don\u2019t want to mention her name, Stacey Abrams. She\u2019s trying to walk that back. You know why? Because she has political aspirations. And right now she\u2019s hurting the people she apparently claims she\u2019s trying to help.\u201d", "\u201cDr. King would be an outcast. Dr. King would not be welcome within the Democratic Party. The Democrats cannot even adopt his language or his philosophy now, because last year the Democrats says go ahead and riot, Kamala Harris is bailing out criminals. And so you\u2019re talking about a man of peace like Dr. King, a person saying judge a person by his character. Listen, if you\u2019re white, you\u2019re in trouble automatically. You\u2019re evil if you\u2019re white. The Democrats have flipped the civil rights message upside down. And it\u2019s embarrassing. I\u2019ve been a civil rights attorney for 30 years. You look at people, regardless of race, regardless of color, you judge the people on their character. That\u2019s not the Democratic playbook right now. It\u2019s color, it\u2019s race. If you\u2019re the wrong color, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["terrell", "king", "trying", "stacey", "civil", "rights", "shes", "leo", "hurting", "help", "abrams", "color", "claims", "white", "walk", "democrats", "youre"], "pubDate": "2021-04-06T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
