But I think people will understand that we will put ourselves first, then our friends \u2013 albeit with a very short space of time between the two.\u201d", "Breton said Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, had confirmed to him that all but 1.2m-1.5m doses at a Dutch plant owned by the Anglo-Swedish company\u2019s Halix subcontractor would be delivered to EU member states.", "Breton said the plant\u2019s management had told him \u2013 contrary to some press reports \u2013 that it had received no UK government funding. Britain had nonetheless claimed a contractual right to the 7.5m doses a month it produced, later suggesting a 50/50 split.", "Breton said AstraZeneca had conceded that all but one batch of the plant\u2019s vaccines would stay in the EU. \u201cI organised a three-way video teleconference between the CEOs of Halix and AstraZeneca, and finally the CEO of AstraZeneca recognised that all the production of Halix was planned to support the EU delivery,\u201d he said.", "The stockpile at the plant in Leiden had been seen in Whitehall as key in making up a shortfall in UK production and deliveries from India, where the government has in effect imposed an export ban on AstraZeneca doses made by the Serum Institute.", "Breton said the European commission and AstraZeneca had signed a \u201cbest efforts\u201d contract relying on five factories, including two in the UK, \u201ca few days\u201d before Britain had signed its deal, which he said he had not seen.", "\u201cI\u2019m told the British health minister has said the UK has an \u2018exclusivity contract\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I cannot imagine the company took the legal risk of signing an \u2018exclusivity\u2019 contract just after signing a \u2018best efforts\u2019 contract. That seems to me very dangerous legally. I cannot think it is the reality.\u201d", "Breton said he was confident AstraZeneca would meet its commitment to supply 70m doses to the EU in the second quarter, because the output of the Halix plant and the company\u2019s Seneffe factory in Belgium \u201cpretty much matches\u201d the total promised.", "But he noted the company had signed up to deliver 180m doses in the second quarter, and said the company had managed to supply only 30m of a contracted 120m doses in the first quarter. All the EU\u2019s other suppliers had produced more than forecast, he said.", "Britain, the EU and AstraZeneca have been in fraught talks since it emerged last month that 21m shots produced in the EU had been exported to the UK, with none coming the other way. Brussels has since toughened its export restrictions to ensure vaccine-producing countries show \u201creciprocity\u201d by sharing their output.", "Breton said the \u201cextremely rapid\u201d increase in European production capacity should allow the EU27 to compensate for first-quarter shortfalls. Increased supplies have allowed several members states to set new daily vaccination records this week, including Germany (650,000), Spain (453,000) and France (437,000).", "The bloc is on course to meet its target of fully inoculating 70% of its adult population by mid-July, he said, \u201cwith vaccines that will all have been produced in Europe\u201d. He said that after a slow start, \u201clike the fable of the tortoise and the hare\u201d, it looked as if the European campaign was accelerating as the British rollout was starting to flag.", "\u201cThe British policy of prioritising first doses was completely understandable, but it means it now has to find second doses, and in a hurry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make anyone anxious, we will of course do all we can to meet their needs, but we also have certain constraints in Europe.\u201d", "Breton said politics were \u201charmful\u201d to all vaccination campaigns. He said he was confident that in terms of production capacity, the EU would meet its 70% target, allowing it \u201can almost normal tourist season\u201d, and that the UK should be able to meet its objective of administering a single dose to the whole of its adult population by the end of July.", "\u201cI think we may have a few weeks\u2019 lead,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got nothing to do with Brexit, nothing to do with politics. Our objective is to meet our target, and to help our friends meet theirs. That is in everyone\u2019s interest. Once again, I\u2019m not asking for thanks. I\u2019m just asking for people to say things as they are.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jon Henley", "Daniel Boffey"], "keywords": ["second", "uk", "doses", "recognition", "brussels", "meet", "amiss", "european", "vaccine", "eu", "production", "europe", "eus", "effort", "astrazeneca"], "pubDate": "2021-04-08T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
