Our victory!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you protest doesn\u2019t work,\u201d a man told the crowd through a bullhorn.", "Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise, was the only family member in court. He sat praying in the minutes before the verdict and was visibly shaking as it was announced. As the guilty verdicts were proclaimed, he closed his eyes and nodded his head repeatedly.", "\u201cI was just praying they would find him guilty. As an African American, we usually never get justice,\u201d he said immediately afterwards.", "Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, said in a statement: \u201cJustice for Black America is justice for all of America. This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state.\u201d", "President Joe Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and Jill Biden, the first lady, called members of the Floyd family moments after the verdict, according to video posted by Crump. Biden told the family: \u201cNothing is going to make it all better, but at least now there is some justice.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re all so relieved.\u201d", "At George Floyd Square, the makeshift memorial that has grown up in the street where Chauvin killed him, Mileesha Smith welcomed the verdicts.", "People inside the Twees Foods Store in the Third Ward where George Floyd grew up watch the verdict in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial in Houston, Texas.

We need the change and we got it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than the verdict. What we\u2019ve been fighting for this entire time. You\u2019re telling us that we are right.\u201d", "The convictions sent a wave of relief across large parts of a city that was badly hit by riots and looting in the days after Floyd\u2019s death alongside peaceful protests. Hundreds of national guard troops had been deployed in preparation for an acquittal.", "However, a fatal police shooting in Ohio of a 15-year-old girl, which took place just moments before the verdict was read, unleashed a sense of fury and frustration among protesters who gathered at the scene.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t get to celebrate nothing,\u201d said one protester, KC Taynor, according to the Columbus Dispatch. \u201cIn the end, you know what, you can\u2019t be Black.\u201d", "Chauvin, who showed little emotion as the verdicts were read, was immediately taken into custody to await sentencing. He faces up to 40 years in prison but is likely to receive a shorter sentence, according to legal guidelines.", "Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, welcomed the verdicts. \u201cI would not call today\u2019s verdict justice, however, because justice implies true restoration, but it is accountability which is the first step towards justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThis verdict reminds us that we must make enduring enduring, systemic, societal change.\u201d", "The conviction does not put an end to the highly charged case, which reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement, as three other officers face trial later this year accused of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.", "01:57 'Accountability, not yet justice': how the US reacted to the Chauvin verdict \u2013 video", "The speed of the verdicts, on just the second day of deliberation, suggests that the video footage of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck \u2013 which sparked the protests that swept the US \u2013 was decisive in persuading the jurors a murder had been committed.", "But many activists remain sceptical about the significance of Chauvin\u2019s prosecution, in part because the case was built around accusing the officer of failing to follow procedure and training, rather than examining the fundamental issues around policing in the US, including the use of force.", "Joe Biden speaks on the verdict as Kamala Harris looks on, at the White House. Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters", "Joe Biden, in an address to the nation, praised the verdict but noted how difficult it is to ensure justice is served.", "\u201cThis can be a giant step forward in the march towards justice in America. But let\u2019s also be clear: such a verdict is also much too rare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors. A brave young woman with a smartphone camera. A crowd that was traumatised. Traumatised witnesses. A murder that lasts almost 10 minutes in broad daylight. Officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks.\u201d", "Biden said all of those factors and more were required for Chauvin to be brought to justice.", "\u201cFor so many it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver just basic accountability,\u201d he said.", "The second-degree murder charge required the jury to find that Chauvin committed a crime by kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, which in turn led to his death.", "The prosecution put a persuasive case to the jury as a string of witnesses \u2013 including Chauvin\u2019s former police colleagues, medical experts and bystanders \u2013 built a picture of an officer who exceeded his authority and training in pressing his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.", "In Minneapolis, celebrations broke out at the news of a guilty verdict. Photograph: Nikolas Liepins/Rex/Shutterstock", "Medical specialists described how the combined weight of Chauvin and two other police officers pinning Floyd to the street in a prone position would have had the effect of \u201cgrinding and crushing him until the very breath, the very life, was squeezed out of him\u201d.", "A pulmonologist, Dr Martin Tobin, gave graphic testimony about Floyd\u2019s desperate struggle to breathe as the position he was held in, pinned between police officers and the street with his cuffed hands pushed into his chest, meant he could barely use one of his lungs at all.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like the left side is in a vice. It\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.", "The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd was still speaking which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.", "After that there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen.", "Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.", "The defence attempted to claim Chauvin was following his training, but in convicting him of second-degree murder the jury rejected the assertion that the former police officer was permitted to put his knee on the victim\u2019s neck for an extended period of time.", "The defence also attempted to claim that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, and that he died from a cardiac arrest caused by an enlarged and diseased heart, and exacerbated by drug use.", "01:44 'We are able to breathe again': George Floyd\u2019s family reacts to Derek Chauvin verdict \u2013 video", "But that did not wash with the jury, perhaps because the excruciating video of Floyd\u2019s suffering revealed an officer who showed cavalier indifference as he defied calls from bystanders and even one of his fellow officers to remove his knee and help the detained man.", "Prosecution experts said that although Floyd had heart problems, he would not have died if it had not been for the police cutting off his oxygen supply.", "Chauvin is expected to appeal, although he will face an uphill struggle to get the verdicts overturned, given that murder convictions are overwhelmingly upheld. The grounds for appeal could include that the convicted former police officer did not get a fair trial because of publicity around the case.", "His lawyer, Eric Nelson, raised the issue at the end of the trial, telling the judge that the jury should have been sequestered throughout the whole trial, not just while it considered the verdict. Nelson also raised concerns that protests over the recent police killing of Daunte Wright, just 10 miles from the trial, may have influenced the jury.", "Nelson also sought a mistrial over comments by a member of Congress, Maxine Waters, who called for protesters to \u201cget more confrontational\u201d if Chauvin were acquitted. The judge, Peter Cahill, refused to motion but criticised Waters and said she may have provided grounds for appeal.", "\u201cI\u2019ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Chris Mcgreal", "Lois Beckett", "Oliver Laughland", "Amudalat Ajasa"], "keywords": ["floyds", "trial", "chauvin", "george", "officer", "floyd", "guilty", "verdict", "derek", "verdicts", "justice", "murder", "jury"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
