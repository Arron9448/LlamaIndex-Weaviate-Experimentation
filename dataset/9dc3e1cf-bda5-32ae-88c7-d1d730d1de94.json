The kind you see on the news. It\u2019s not that I expected Aaron Paul to live in a trailer, cooking meth in his underpants, but this is a surprise. To clarify, the rest of his Hollywood house is beautiful, befitting the star of one of the most successful TV shows of all time. Breaking Bad broke viewing records and was acclaimed as the high watermark in a golden age of long-form television. Bryan Cranston\u2019s performance as chemistry-teacher-turned-drug-kingpin Walter White is often described as Shakespearian, yet it was the slow-burn arc of his slacker prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jesse Pinkman, that was arguably more cathartic. How does any actor move on after being in a masterpiece? \u201cWe talk about it all the time,\u201d he admits. The way he describes the finale sounds almost painful. \u201cIt was next to perfect. Brian and I read it together at his place in New Mexico. When he read the screen direction \u2018end of series\u2019 we just sat in silence for 30 seconds.\u201d", "I meet Paul earlier at a long table in his expansive garden, amid the sound of rushing water. He smiles broadly, the sun beaming just for him. It\u2019s kind of strange to see him happy, in patterned shirt and shorts. \u201cI know how lucky I am. I\u2019m on top of the world.\u201d The breeziness contrasts sharply with his onscreen presence. There, he has a mania in his blue eyes and flushing skin, threat in the ravaged growl of his voice, but also beautiful vulnerability. We see the puppy inside the feral dog. No matter how intense the situation, you believe him as an actor.", "It\u2019s frustrating that since that finale, he hasn\u2019t taken on a leading role of weight. There was Exodus, an underwhelming Ridley Scott biblical epic, and Need for Speed, an overtly foolish video game tie-in about street racers. He does produce the excellent cartoon BoJack Horseman and his upcoming role in Westworld should be a better fit. But judging by social media, Paul seems to be most passionate about Dos Hombres, his mezcal collaboration with Bryan Cranston. Fans were delighted then, by the announcement of El Camino, a standalone movie sequel to Breaking Bad, which streams on Netflix from 11 October. What might surprise them is that it\u2019s Jesse\u2019s film alone. Yet Paul is confident there\u2019s enough story to tell. \u201cI lived and breathed every moment of his life that we saw, and then some. This is the role of a lifetime.\u201d", "It must be a strange thing for a man in early middle age to be so closely identified with a baggy-panted drug dealer he first played in his mid-20s. \u201cI thought we finished that story six years ago,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cAnd now I zipped on the skin again.\u201d But he\u2019d follow writer-director Vince Gilligan into a fire, and public appetite was overwhelming. \u201cPeople were just so passionate, and wanted answers. Asking when the next series of Breaking Bad was gonna be \u2013 you can put that dream away \u2013 wanting to know what happens to Jesse. And what happened to Jesse.\u201d There\u2019s a clear sense he owes the character a life debt, for the adulation he receives, and the luxury surrounding us. \u201cA lot of people will always see me as Jesse, and I take that as a compliment. The show was a game changer.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A lot of people will always see me as Jesse\u2019: with Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad", "Unlike Jesse, the young Aaron Paul Sturtevant was always laser-focused on career. The youngest child of a Southern Baptist minister, he grew up taking part in church plays. The family didn\u2019t have money, so from the age of 11 he started saving in a glass jar beside his bed for a move to Hollywood. Uninterested in girlfriends or anything else, he graduated a year early, moving to Los Angeles at 17, where his cute, boy-doll face started landing him commercials \u2013 around 50 national spots, even for rival companies. \u201cI know I did Vanilla Coke; there might have been a Pepsi.\u201d", "He was making plenty of money, but it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. By his early 20s they\u2019d dried up, though he was landing guest spots on major shows: ER, The X-Files, NYPD Blue and a recurring character in Big Love for HBO. Still, the reality of being an actor is rarely secure. \u201cThey\u2019d squeeze all my scenes into a day, so I was making about $600 an episode.\u201d He describes the age of 27 as the low point of his career: he\u2019d done six failed pilots that year and couldn\u2019t pay his bills. That\u2019s when the audition for Breaking Bad came through. His character wasn\u2019t supposed to survive the first season, but as Vince Gilligan observed the growing chemistry between Paul and Cranston, he adjusted his plan. Ratings for the show were initially modest, but the reviews were exceptional. \u201cWhen the first three series landed on Netflix, my life changed.\u201d", "Word of mouth and critical acclaim saw the show become a phenomenon, picking up fans by the legion. They still hold screener parties, crank out plot theories on message boards, make DIY art, display chest tattoos of Walter and Jesse cooking meth. The pair became endlessly memed, pop-cultural heroes. (Just a few days ago, a colleague of mine who has seen the series three times mentioned he owned Lego-style figures of them in their meth-cooking suits, and asked if I would bring them with me to be signed. I didn\u2019t.)", "It was crazy to be at the centre of it all, Paul says. Exposing as an artist, too. \u201cAt the beginning of my career I was not great. Even at the beginning of Breaking Bad \u2013 I was OK, I got the job. But I grew so much as an actor. Everyone saw it.\u201d He credits working alongside Cranston, describing him as a mentor. Their story is narratively satisfying: as Walter shades bitterly into the villain, his underachieving former student grows into a hero. But the story resonates at a deeper level than that. The actor looked so young in those early episodes. It\u2019s powerful, watching the deadbeat come good, because someone believed in him once: the parable of the prodigal son.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Becoming a father is a front-row seat to the greatest show on earth\u2019: with his wife Lauren Parsekian, with whom he has a young daughter.

Paul remembers being at a concert with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a while, and who was in the middle of a crisis. \u201cHe\u2019d found out his fianc\u00e9e was cheating on him and just told me they\u2019d called off the wedding.

Lemme take a picture with you, bitch!\u201d [A reference to Jesse\u2019s politically incorrect if undeniably funny catchphrase.] Paul tried to let her know it wasn\u2019t a good time, while protecting his friend\u2019s privacy. \u201cShe\u2019s like: \u2018You\u2019re not gonna take a picture? You\u2019re such an asshole, who do you think you are? Fuck you!\u2019\u201d He\u2019s aware that somewhere, she\u2019ll be passing around the story from her point of view about Aaron Paul, the arrogant jerk.", "Does the obsessive attention people pay the show ever get too much? \u201cAt least they like it,\u201d he shrugs. It\u2019s tough to penetrate the charming interview technique of a star who doesn\u2019t want to alienate his fan base. But there\u2019s a stranger aspect to it, in which Paul presents himself as just a regular guy with no issues. I find it impossible to believe. He\u2019s too good at inhabiting anguish, at being tortured. It has to come from somewhere deep. I noticed a lot of clown stuff around when I came in: Pierrot figurines, a coffee-table history of the circus. What\u2019s that about? \u201cI love Cirque du Soleil,\u201d he says. Hmm. How about the strange portraiture on the walls, unsettling works by artists Mark Ryden and Lola Gil? Paul doesn\u2019t understand why people find them creepy. \u201cIt\u2019s just a baby riding a lamb.\u201d", "I probe a little deeper \u2013 trying to find out what\u2019s in his basement, so to speak. What was it like being raised in a devoutly religious house? \u201cVery intense. My father had me quote scripture. I still have multiple scriptures in my head.\u201d What\u2019s his favourite? \u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite,\u201d he says quickly. He\u2019s not religious and doesn\u2019t want to tell anyone how to think. I wonder what his parents make of their son being an icon for meth-heads. They\u2019re fans of Breaking Bad, he assures me, although there are projects of his they don\u2019t like. Need for Speed? If Paul is offended, he doesn\u2019t let it show. \u201cNo, they love Need for Speed. They thought it was a fun movie.\u201d", "So where on earth does that intensity and access to emotion come from? You\u2019ve just got to act, Paul tells me. Force yourself to believe a situation is real. He looks amused and apologetic, as if he\u2019s sorry he couldn\u2019t help with my enquiries. \u201cSome actors think about dead puppies. I do not.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meet and greet: signing autographs as he arrives at the 20th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.

The 19-month-old has been perched on his lap, but he disappears for a few minutes to put her down. He\u2019d never wanted children, he admits when he returns, although his partner did. He was in his late 30s, scared of giving up his freedom. \u201cThank God I changed my mind, man. My life began when she was born.\u201d His blue eyes are lit up. Fittingly, it was acting that brought about the conversion \u2013 playing a dad of two in The Path, the cancelled Hulu show about a spiritual leader experiencing a crisis of faith.", "Working with young actors who would throw their arms around him, entering the mindset of being a caretaker, made Paul realise he was open to the idea of being a father. He kept the revelation a secret from his wife for six months. When he finally told her, she made him repeat the words. She\u2019d married on the understanding a family was not on the table, had chosen a life with him, rather than kids with someone else. \u201cAfter having a child, I realise what a sacrifice that was. I hadn\u2019t understood,\u201d he says.", "He\u2019s talking with an energy and sincerity I naively thought we\u2019d share discussing a TV show. \u201cThrough babies\u2019 eyes, you see a sense of wonder in the world that you\u2019ve grown used to.

He takes me into a side room that contains his treasured possessions: on the shelves I spy his gleaming Emmy awards, and the burned-up pink bear that falls from the sky in Breaking Bad\u2019s second season. But they\u2019re not what he wants me to see. He really does love drinking, he tells me as he opens a door to the side. Behind it is another full-sized safe-door, which he unlocks. Inside, a cupboard is lined with ancient, burlap-wrapped bottles of booze. It\u2019s pretty cool, but there\u2019s more. \u201cThe house was built during Prohibition,\u201d he explains. Reaching down, he flips a tiny, disguised latch built into a corner. The floor opens and reveals the bare concrete steps leading down to a secret room. It\u2019s a speakeasy. I start laughing, too, from the surprise. Paul intends to design the bar himself and have parties here. It\u2019s easily the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.", "So, is he just going to bunker down with his family, and drink? No, there will be acting.
