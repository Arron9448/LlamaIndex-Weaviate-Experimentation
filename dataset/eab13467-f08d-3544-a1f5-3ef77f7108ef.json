Downtown Steamboat stretches along Lincoln and Yampa avenues. These arteries are lined with art galleries, restaurants such as Caf\u00e9 Diva, Salt & Lime, Mazzola\u2019s Italian Restaurant, and a cultural icon of Steamboat, F.M. Light & Sons, a fifth-generation Western-wear shop founded in 1905.", "Steamboat\u2019s natural hot springs and the perception of their therapeutic powers drew early settlers and continue to pack people into pools.

Old Town Hot Springs in the middle of town is a non-profit recreation center built around 102-degree hot springs that flow into eight pools.
