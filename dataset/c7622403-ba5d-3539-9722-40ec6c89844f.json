Its location, though, does not.", "Over the course of three months in 1956, the elegant colonial style property, currently on the market for $1.6m, was moved 100 yards, inch by inch, furniture and all, to its existing spot. \u201cThey took the house in its entirety, with both porches, put it on scaffolding, turned it around and pulled it with a truck to its current site,\u201d says Tony Brewer, who bought the place in 1993 with his wife, Carey.", "The Atlanta house including its contents was moved 100 yards in 1956, to make way for condominiums. The process was photographed by a neighbour, Bill Scott", "The alternative was demolition: the original site was a prime lot on Peachtree Road, a major Atlanta thoroughfare. Developers bought it, planning to bulldoze the house to make way for condominiums. When the tenant renting the house got wind of this, he begged the developers to help him save the property.", "\u201cAfter a couple of months they finally said, \u2018OK, if you move it, we will give you the house because we have an expense in tearing it down.\u2019 So he bought the lot behind and moved it to this site,\u201d says Tony, who learnt the history from a neighbour whose husband had photographed the entire endeavour. The condos went up, as planned.", "\u201cThe story goes that the house, which has seven fireplaces, was moved with all the furniture inside and all the dishes in the cabinets. The only repercussion we saw was that the front door kind of sloped so we remedied that,\u201d says Carey. \u201cThe original property was higher than this one, so they were able to inch it down a hill.\u201d", "The 1920s house has been renovated by its current owners, who have restored many of the original features", "The Brewers, who are moving to Carey\u2019s native South Carolina, spent 18 months renovating the three-storey house to its original 1920s splendour, complete with claw-footed cast iron bathtub, pedestal sinks, and woodwork trims made by the same lumber company, Randall Brothers, that supplied the moulding for most of Atlanta\u2019s grand houses in the 1920s.", "\u201cWe had to bring in a crane and build an indoor railroad track to roll the tub into its place in the master bath,\u201d says Tony, an entrepreneur who used to own a payment services company. The couple say they doubled the liveable space in the basement, which was added after the property was moved, to around 2,000 square feet. As well as a pantry, laundry and craft room, there is now a wine cellar modelled on one the Brewers saw in Paris. The third storey was also extended: a fifth bedroom and extra bathroom were added to the existing billiards room.", "The colonial character of the house lends itself to being extensively adorned with decorations at Christmas", "The seven fireplaces make the house particularly cosy in winter. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s the perfect Christmas house because of how we decorate it [with] the age, facade, door casings, fireplaces and high ceilings all contributing to the charm. We\u2019ve had as many as seven Christmas trees [at once]. We\u2019ve done a lot of entertaining; there is space comfortably for 100 people,\u201d says Tony. The previous owner\u2019s daughter held her wedding in the back garden, where there is a heated swimming pool, as did a family friend.", "During the renovations, a crane and indoor rails were required to get the bathroom tub into position", "The neighbourhood is part of Historic Brookhaven in Buckhead, an affluent district some dub \u201cThe Beverly Hills of the south\u201d.
