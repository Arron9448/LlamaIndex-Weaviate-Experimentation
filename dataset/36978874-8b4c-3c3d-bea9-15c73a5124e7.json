Hollywood was too timid, too worried about the national \u201cimage.\u201d Meanwhile, Swedish, Japanese, Italian, and French filmmakers were making movies that people talked about. \u201cWhile the whole film world has been buzzing with new excitement,\u201d the magazine concluded, \u201cHollywood has felt like Charlie Chaplin standing outside the millionaire\u2019s door\u2014wistful and forsaken.\u201d", "Exactly four years later, which, in feature-film production time, is virtually overnight, Time, the sister publication of Life, ran a cover story on \u201cThe New Cinema.\u201d \u201cThe most important fact about the screen in 1967,\u201d it announced, \u201cis that Hollywood has at long last become part of what the French film journal Cahiers du Cinema calls \u2018the furious springtime of world cinema.\u2019 \u201d How this happened, how Hollywood suddenly went from losing millions on bloated spectacles like \u201cMutiny on the Bounty\u201d (1962) and \u201cCleopatra\u201d (1963) to producing smart, talked-about pictures like \u201cThe Graduate\u201d (1967) and \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d (1967)\u2014how Old Hollywood became the New Hollywood\u2014is a popular subject for movie historians.", "One film that\u2019s often left out of the story is \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d When it was released, in May, 1969, \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d seemed as fresh, as startling, and as \u201cmust-see\u201d as \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d But it is not mentioned once in Robert Sklar\u2019s \u201cMovie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies.\u201d It comes up a few times, but only in passing, in Peter Biskind\u2019s \u201cEasy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock-\u2019n\u2019-Roll Generation Saved Hollywood\u201d and in Mark Harris\u2019s \u201cPictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood.\u201d", "Glenn Frankel\u2019s new book, \u201cShooting \u2018Midnight Cowboy\u2019: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic\u201d (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), aims to change all that. \u201cMore than fifty years later,\u201d Frankel believes, \u201cMidnight Cowboy remains a bleak and troubling work of novelistic and cinematic invention, floating far above most other books and films of its era.\u201d Frankel\u2019s book is generous with context, but it is, essentially, the biography of a movie. He has also written books on \u201cThe Searchers\u201d and \u201cHigh Noon.\u201d These have the same interest that biographies of famous people do: they show us the \u201cwhat if\u201ds and the \u201cbut for\u201ds hiding in the backstory of the finished product.", "Many more movies don\u2019t get made than get made: there is so much that has to go right, and so much that can go wrong. Movie production requires the collaboration of creative people working under constant pressure to control costs and turn a profit. With dozens of egos in the game and millions of dollars on the table, it is inevitable that things won\u2019t go entirely as planned.", "So it is not too surprising to learn that the director of \u201cMidnight Cowboy,\u201d John Schlesinger, had difficulty getting studio financing, which wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that his previous movie, \u201cFar from the Madding Crowd,\u201d with Julie Christie, had bombed. Or that he initially considered the novel that the film is based on to be unreadable. Or that he did not want to cast either of the actors who became the movie\u2019s stars: Dustin Hoffman, as the Times Square lowlife Rico (Ratso) Rizzo, and Jon Voight, as Joe Buck, the Texas innocent who comes to New York seeking to make his fortune servicing rich women and ends up taking care of Ratso.", "Robert Redford (who had also hoped to get the role Hoffman played in \u201cThe Graduate\u201d) and Warren Beatty both lobbied to get the part of Joe Buck. Someone at M-G-M, which declined to produce the picture, suggested Elvis Presley, and the role was offered to Michael Sarrazin, but the deal fell through, when the studio that he was under contract to asked for more money. The name of the casting director responsible for getting Hoffman and Voight onto the project, Marion Dougherty, was left off the credits.", "What most people remember from the movie, after Hoffman\u2019s and Voight\u2019s performances, is Harry Nilsson singing \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talkin\u2019.\u201d Frankel says that Nilsson actually disliked the song, and had recorded it on one of his albums only as a favor to his producer. What might have been: Leonard Cohen pitched \u201cBird on the Wire\u201d by singing it to Schlesinger over the phone, and Bob Dylan wrote a song for the movie, probably \u201cLay Lady Lay,\u201d but it didn\u2019t make the cut, because he submitted it too late. Another thing everyone remembers, a line eternally implanted in every New Yorker\u2019s head, \u201cI\u2019m walkin\u2019 here!,\u201d is not in the screenplay. Hoffman ad-libbed it.", "The screenwriter hired to adapt the novel, Waldo Salt, was another gamble. He had been blacklisted, and for eleven years he seldom wrote under his own name. He was fifty-two years old and had not worked on a notable Hollywood movie since the nineteen-forties.", "The film\u2019s editor was Hugh Robertson. Schlesinger didn\u2019t get along with him; the producer, Jerry Hellman, called him \u201ca catastrophe.\u201d Robertson, for his part, was contemptuous of what Schlesinger had shot. He thought it was ignorant, a tourist\u2019s idea of New York City. (Schlesinger was English.) Eventually, Schlesinger brought in a film editor he had worked with before, Jim Clark, to fix the mess he thought Robertson was making of his movie.", "\u201cThe Graduate\u201d had made Hoffman a matin\u00e9e idol. Female fans mobbed him. But he felt that people thought he was just playing himself in that picture, and he badly wanted the part of Ratso in order to show off his range as an actor\u2014even though Mike Nichols, his director on \u201cThe Graduate,\u201d warned him that it would ruin his career. Hoffman got top billing, but he was annoyed when he realized that Voight was the movie\u2019s center of interest. He complained that Schlesinger had cut a scene he was especially proud of. He was a no-show at promotional events. The producer denied him points.", "And yet it all worked out. \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d made almost forty-five million dollars on a budget of under four million. It won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Hugh Robertson was nominated for film editing, and Waldo Salt won for best adapted screenplay. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talkin\u2019 \u201d made Harry Nilsson famous, went to No. 6 on Billboard, and sold a million records. And the movie did not ruin Dustin Hoffman\u2019s career. He and Voight both received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor. The Oscar, however, went to John Wayne, who called \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d \u201ca story about two fags.\u201d", "Of course, \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d is not a story about \u201ctwo fags.\u201d But, somehow, it very quickly became associated with a new era of frankness about homosexuality, an association enhanced by the fact, completely unrelated, that the Stonewall riots, which conventionally mark the start of the gay-liberation movement, broke out a month after \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d opened.", "Frankel thinks that the association is important. He sees the movie in the context of \u201cthe rise of openly gay writers and gay liberation.\u201d And Mark Harris, in the liner notes for the Criterion DVD, says that \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d is, \u201cif not a gay movie, a movie that at least helped to make the notion of a gay movie possible.\u201d They\u2019re right, but it\u2019s a tricky case to make.", "It\u2019s true that \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d is the story of two men who develop an affectionate relationship under trying circumstances, but so is \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d which came out the same year and was its principal rival for Best Picture. You can read an element of homoeroticism into buddy pictures like these, in which the women are often treated as expendable accessories. But no one imagines that such films give audiences a more enlightened way to think about homosexuality.", "Frankel believes it\u2019s important that Schlesinger was gay. But, as he concedes, this was not common knowledge. Schlesinger did not come out publicly until the nineteen-nineties, and he said that he did not consider \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d a \u201cgay\u201d picture. His next movie, \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday\u201d (1971), had a sympathetic gay character, played by Peter Finch. But there is no one like that in \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d", "Joe and Ratso are shown to have little sympathy for homosexuals, and they use John Wayne\u2019s F-word often. According to Schlesinger\u2019s biographer, William Mann, Hoffman thought his character should also use the N-word, but Schlesinger was horrified and refused to let him. Still, he was fine with homophobic slurs. Many years later, he claimed that the use of the word by the characters was \u201ca sign of overprotestation,\u201d but this seems a justification in hindsight.", "There are few gay characters with speaking roles in the movie. One is a sad-sack teen-ager, played by Bob Balaban, who goes down on an obviously grossed out Joe in a Times Square movie house and afterward confesses he has no money to pay him. Another is a self-hating middle-aged man (Barnard Hughes) who takes Joe to his hotel room and gets beaten up, which excites him."], "authors": ["Louis Menand", "Louis Menan"], "keywords": ["movies", "making", "midnight", "film", "movie", "picture", "hollywood", "cowboy", "hoffman", "gay", "schlesinger", "remaking"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
