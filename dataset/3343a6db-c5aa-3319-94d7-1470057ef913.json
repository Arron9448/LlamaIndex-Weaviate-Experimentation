Situated in Croix-des-Bouquets, one of Port-au-Prince\u2019s poorest suburbs and where Wyclef Jean spent his formative years, the Centre Technique National was once a country mansion where Haitian dictator Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier hosted his wedding reception in 1980 at a reported cost of $5m.", "Having allegedly diverted money from US humanitarian aid to finance the development of the sport that helped Haiti qualify the 1974 World Cup, Duvalier was the first to build a football pitch at the site now known as the Fifa Goal Centre. Nowadays the centre it houses up to 200 young players, most of them the best prospects in Haiti. It was a power base for Yves Jean-Bart, the man who ruled Haitian football for 20 years until, in November 2020, he was banned for life by Fifa following a Guardian investigation detailing allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of young female players.", "The 73-year-old has consistently denied the claims, which were first made in the Guardian at the end of April, and said that he intends to appeal against Fifa\u2019s decision at the court of arbitration for sport. Just one day before the Fifa judgment, Haiti prosecutors said they had cleared Jean-Bart, but under pressure from the US embassy, they are reopening the case. And there is finally some optimism that Jean-Bart\u2019s rule at the centre is over. But still, some shadows are hanging over the ranch.", "A dormitory corridor at the centre in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. Photograph: Pierre Michel Jean/AFP/Getty Images", "\u2018Dadou\u2019", "In February 1972 Jean-Bart was part of a group that formed AS Tigresses, one of Haiti\u2019s first female football clubs. In those days he was a trainee doctor and sports journalist in his mid-20s, already known by his nickname \u201cDadou\u201d. According to a report in the Haiti Tempo newspaper, Jean-Bart initially used the nickname as a pseudonym as he defied his father\u2019s request that he should leave journalism following a controversial match report which led to his father receiving abuse from disgruntled fans. The Tigresses have gone on to become one of Haiti\u2019s most successful clubs \u2013 they won six national titles in a row between 2013 and 2018. The club also has a volleyball team that competes in the national league.", "Dadou was always very charismatic and was friends with everyone", "While also working as a doctor \u2013 he qualified in 1973 \u2013 Jean-Bart became an influential figure in Haiti football thanks to his career as a radio presenter, working for stations Nationale and M\u00e9tropole among others. He became vice-president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Ha\u00eftienne De Football (FHF), Haiti\u2019s football association, in 1991, automatically gaining him Fifa membership. He was elected FHF president in 2000 a few weeks after Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti\u2019s first democratically elected president, won his second term in office.", "\u201cDadou was always very charismatic and was already friends with everyone,\u201d says Haitian journalist Pierre Richard Midy, now living in exile in Brazil. \u201cHe was very popular on the radio and used to come up with lots of new ideas for the federation when he was vice-president. It was very easy for him to convince \u2018the club\u2019 that he was the right person to become the next president so it was no surprise when that happened.\u201d", "In April 2002 a ceremony was held to mark the completion of the first phase of the new Fifa Goal Centre in Croix-des-Bouquets, including an administrative office, an auditorium with seating for 300 and a dormitory for up to 32 players in 16 air-conditioned rooms. According to Fifa\u2019s press release at the time Jack Warner, president of Concacaf, the governing body for football in North and Central America, described the centre as \u201can integral aspect of Fifa president Joseph S. Blatter\u2019s vision, intended to level the international playing field\u201d.", "Warner also \u201cassured the gathering that the Goal-financed centre will allow Haiti to recapture some of its past football glories\u201d. The FHF was one of the first national bodies to receive direct funding from the programme, created by Blatter a year after he had succeeded Jo\u00e3o Havelange as president. It is estimated that the FHF was given around $1.2m towards construction of the centre over the next eight years, although the majority of funding and the donation of the land itself came from the Haitian government.", "But while the men\u2019s team failed to qualify for Concacaf\u2019s flagship competition, the Gold Cup, until 2007, Jean-Bart continued to strengthen his position at the helm of the FHF and to develop close relationships with various local club presidents. \u201cBetween 2004 and 2008 in his second mandate, everything started,\u201d says Midy. \u201cMost of the clubs were struggling for money so it was easy for him to do favours to help the owners and there was a lot of corruption. In his third mandate, things got even worse \u2013 and then there was the earthquake.\u201d", "A spokesman for Jean-Bart told us: \u201cIt should be obvious that Dr Jean-Bart successfully fulfilled the requirements of his job because the position of federation president required him to maintain close relationships with club presidents, and he did so in full compliance with the appropriate rules and regulations.\u201d", "Haiti\u2019s under-17 girls\u2019 team were training at the national stadium in Port-au-Prince when tragedy struck on 12 January 2010. Their coach, Jean-Yves Labaze, who was described as \u201clike a father\u201d to most of the team, was killed by falling rubble as he attended meetings at the FHF\u2019s headquarters nearby, with Jean-Bart later being described as one of only two survivors. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many [we] lost,\u201d he told journalist Joshua Robinson.", "Some, including Midy, cast doubt on Jean-Bart\u2019s claims about the scale of the disaster. But asked about this Jean-Bart\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWhen the federation building collapsed, more than 20 people died inside it that day, with the president narrowly escaping and suffering injuries that still affect him today. The Guardian should be ashamed for questioning the humanitarian disaster in Haiti and the devastating impact and trauma of the earthquake on its people and football program.\u201d", "Jean-Bart in April 2013 with then Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke, left, at the national stadium in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Photograph: Dieu Nalio Chery/AP", "An immediate $250,000 grant from world football\u2019s governing body was reported to have been paid to the FHF, with Jean-Bart telling Sports Illustrated that Fifa was intending to set up a $3m fund \u201cwhich it will manage, to help rebuild the sport\u2019s infrastructure\u201d. Sports Illustrated reported that Warner, the head of Concacaf, \u201cpledged $100,000 of his personal fortune\u201d and that \u201cChung Mong-joon, a Fifa vice president from South Korea, added $500,000.\u201d", "In 2015, having already been arrested in connection with corruption and money laundering charges, Warner was accused by US investigators of diverting $750,000 in emergency funds donated by Fifa and the Korean Football Association that had been intended for victims in Haiti, a charge he denied.", "Four years earlier, Caribbean football was caught up in a bribery scandal after Fifa\u2019s ethics committee ruled that each of the 25 Concacaf association chiefs were made or offered cash gifts of $40,000 by Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam to back his bid for the presidency. Fifa issued bans ranging between seven days and two years to 10 Caribbean officials. Jean-Bart was one of a group given a warning, with Warner resigning before the investigation was complete. Jean-Bart replaced him as the acting president of the Caribbean Football Union before Gordon Derrick took over in 2012.", "Downfall", "In February 2020 \u2013 two weeks after he was re-elected as FHF president for the sixth time, as the only candidate \u2013 Jean-Bart received a letter from Gianni Infantino that had been hand-signed \u201cCher Yves\u201d by the Fifa president. Fifa\u2019s statutes recommend that national federation presidents should serve a maximum of three terms, but Infantino was gushing in his congratulations. A Fifa spokesperson explained later that it recommends to all member associations the introduction of terms limits in line with its statutes \u201chowever this is not an obligation\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is standard practice to congratulate all duly elected president of member associations.\u201d", "Infantino certainly did that. \u201cYour re-election represents a vote of confidence in your abilities on the part of the Haitian football community,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am convinced that your rich experience, knowledge and personal qualities will have a significant impact on the further development of our sport in your country over the coming years \u2026 We look forward to seeing you again soon and congratulating you face to face, I ask you to believe, dear President, dear Yves, in the assurance of my most cordial feelings.\u201d", "Gianni Infantino at a press conference at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince in 2017. In February Infantino wrote to congratulate Jean-Bart on his re-election \u2013 \u2018standard practice\u2019, Fifa said later. Photograph: Dieu Nalio Chery/AP", "But as Jean-Bart took the plaudits the Guardian was learning of some allegations that ultimately forced Fifa to drastically recast its attitude to Jean-Bart. They alleged that Jean-Bart been had been abusing young female players and referees at the centre. Over several months the Guardian gathered together harrowing stories from alleged victims. Under condition of anonymity due to fear of violent reprisals, one of the players explained how the ranch\u2019s system of abuse operated. \u201cThere is a lady who works there who puts pressure on the girls to have sex with Dadou,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will see a nice girl who is attractive and he sends the lady to tell her that she is going to be thrown out of the centre. She starts crying and then the lady says: \u2018The only way to resolve this is to speak to Dadou.\u2019 At that moment, the young girl has no choice but to put up with the sexual abuse.\u201d", "Others also claimed to have been coerced by Jean-Bart into having sex with him, including one who was forced to have an abortion. \u201cShe was put under pressure not to talk,\u201d a former player at the centre said. \u201cAnother of our best young players lost her virginity to Dadou when she was 17 in 2018 and also had to abort. These girls who live at the Fifa centre \u2026 it\u2019s such a shame because they want to play for the country but if they speak about this situation they will be fired. They are hostages.\u201d Another added: \u201cI\u2019m so afraid. Dadou Jean-Bart is a very dangerous person. There are a lot of people who want to talk but they\u2019re so afraid, especially for the parents who are still in Haiti.\u201d", "The Guardian first asked questions about the suspected abuse with Fifa on 27 February and again three days later but received no response. The issue was also raised with the players\u2019 union Fifpro at the start of March, who directed us to Fifa\u2019s senior child safeguarding and protection manager, who did not reply. We tried again on 10 March and this time Fifa did respond, urging us to report any allegations to its confidential whistle-blowing hotline. Having provided more details in several emails over the next fortnight, a source confirmed to us that a member of Fifa\u2019s staff had since raised concerns with the FHF directly.The Guardian\u2019s first story, on 30 April, revealed the abuse allegations. It also detailed the living conditions young players at the ranch had to endure - described as \u201ca nightmare\u201d by a former coach. The money put in by Fifa \u2013 an estimated $1m a year since 2010 \u2013 apparently had been squandered. The ranch remained in a dilapidated state after years of neglect. \u201cThe last time I set foot there, I wanted to vomit,\u201d said another former coach. \u201cIt is despicable. Ten kids sleep in every room, there are no sheets, no clean toilets. It\u2019s unimaginable. Where did the money go? The federation received millions, and they didn\u2019t even buy sheets.", "A few days later, journalists from Jean-Bart\u2019s former employers, La Nouvelliste, attempted to gain access to the ranch to investigate the allegations but were turned away. \u201cWe are in confinement,\u201d explained a security guard with a \u201c12-gauge rifle in his hand\u201d. \u201cNobody comes out, nobody comes in. I can\u2019t even make it home.\u201d", "La Nouvelliste\u2019s article also stated that it had been \u201cdifficult\u201d to hear directly from current residents who \u201care placed in confinement, far from microphones and cameras\u201d. The following day, a demonstration was held at the ranch which featured several young female players holding placards in support of Jean-Bart.", "In May 2020 protesters demonstrated outside court hearings into the Jean-Bart allegations. Photograph: Dieu Nalio Chery/AP", "\u201cThe president treats us like his own children. I don\u2019t think that all that really happened. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d a 12-year-old female player told the Agence France-Presse agency (AFP). \u201cThis is an insult to the nation,\u201d added Jean-Bart. Nonetheless, Jean-Bart was summoned to a meeting with the local district attorney, with protestors gathering outside the courthouse to show their solidarity with the alleged victims and promoting the Creole slogan #PaFeSilans (\u201cDo not be silent\u201d).", "On 21 May, the second part of the Guardian\u2019s investigation revealed that several players had received death threats since claims against Jean-Bart had been reported, while another story in the New York Times the next day with the headline \u201cSexual abuse case in global soccer puts Fifa under scrutiny again\u201d placed the spotlight on world football\u2019s governing body. On 25 May, Jean-Bart was suspended by Fifa, initially for 90 days.", "Minky Worden from Human Rights Watch, who provided assistance to some of the players, says the Jean-Bart case bore many similarities to the sexual abuse scandal in Afghanistan, also revealed by the Guardian, that eventually saw former football federation president Keramuddin Karim banned for life. Worden recognised that there was no established process for tackling allegations of this kind when they come from countries with dubious records on human rights. \u201cThey all failed to understand what had to be done. And I include Fifa in that,\u201d she says. \u201cFifa had the same reaction for Afghanistan. The question is why did it take so long to suspend him?\u201d", "Players at Croix-des-Bouquets. Photograph: Pierre Michel Jean/AFP/Getty Images", "Asked by German publication DW why it had waited so long to act, a Fifa spokesman said the initial information was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cinsufficient to start an investigation\u201d, adding that due process had to be followed. When the Guardian this month pressed Fifa on whether it regretted how long it took to suspend Jean-Bart, a spokesman said: \u201cThe proceeding was not slow, taking especially into account the travel restrictions due to Covid-19, several communication issues with the country, the hostility of the environment and above all the challenges in gathering evidence from victims and witnesses whilst ensuring their safety and care. Investigations into sexual abuse cases are extremely sensitive and must be handled with the greatest care. \u201cFor the investigative team in Haiti the top priority has always been \u2013 and remains \u2013 the protection of victims, and they had for instance to intervene to provide support and protection to individuals that had been threatened.\u201d", "Fabienne (not her real name) was one of the first players to allege that she had been sexually abused by Jean-Bart. Once considered to be a star player who had represented Haiti at several youth levels, she remembers being told that her dream of playing professionally overseas \u201cdepended on sleeping with the president\u201d.", "This allegation appears to underline Haiti journalist St\u00e9phane Jean\u2019s view that Jean-Bart \u201cwas too powerful and benefited from the lethal weapon in Haiti, that is to say visas for the US\u201d. When Fabienne was 16 or 17, Jean-Bart \u201cput his hand on my leg to get me to go with him\u201d but she refused. Like many of the players who gave evidence to Fifa, her passport was later taken away and not returned.", "\u201cFor us it had become normal,\u201d says another player. \u201cIn our minds it wasn\u2019t even abuse anymore, it was just something that happened every day. It\u2019s very hard to get out of all of this \u2026 Some players, even today, feel that they had a relationship, not that they were abused.\u201d", "Jean-Bart would also accompany national teams when they played in tournaments overseas, with another player alleging that he forced an injured teammate from the under-18 squad to share a room with him during a trip to the US. \u201cHe had sex with players abroad,\u201d she says. \u201cIn France, at the Under-20 World Cup in 2018, he abused one of the players. Everyone had to go out except her. The next time, she begged everyone not to leave her alone.\u201d", "Jean-Bart\u2019s spokesperson described this allegation as \u201ctotal lie\u201d, adding: \u201cnothing improper took place at the event, where the team performed brilliantly. There were 40-plus people in the Haitian delegation, with all players sharing hotel rooms, the president himself sharing his hotel room with another man, and no players in position to be alone at any moment inside or outside the hotel. The Guardian\u2019s printing and amplifying of demonstrably false allegations against Dr Jean-Bart illustrates either a rapacious appetite for reprinting lies or a startling naivete gleefully exploited by his political enemies in Haiti.\u201d", "The day before Fifa took the ultimate step and banned Jean-Bart for life, he was cleared in Haiti by magistrate Emilio Accim\u00e9. The Haitian judicial authorities have said they are reopening the investigation, a move welcomed by the French embassy in Port-au-Prince. It is understood that officials from both France and the US have been monitoring the case, with the Department of Justice investigating whether any of the former FHF president\u2019s alleged crimes took place on US soil.", "Nela Joseph, the girls\u2019 supervisor who allegedly helped facilitate abuse by Jean-Bart at the centre, and FHF technical director Wilner Etienne have been suspended by Fifa and are still awaiting the outcome of the investigation. Formal investigations into Rosnick Grant, a former international referee who is now president of the FHF\u2019s referees\u2019 commission (Cona) and a vice-president of the FHF and long-serving executive secretary Fenelus Guerrier also continue. A \u201cnormalisation committee\u201d has been brought in to Haiti by Fifa after concerns Jean-Bart was still involved in \u201cthe running of its daily affairs\u201d.", "Meanwhile, Jean-Bart has continued to protest his innocence. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Jean-Bart questioned whether Fifa had the moral authority to investigate him having been caught out in \u201cscandal after scandal\u201d. \u201cThis is the kind of organisation that pretends to be investigating what\u2019s happening in Haiti,\u201d he said.", "Yet while she still remains sceptical that justice will eventually be done in her troubled homeland, Fabienne hopes the end of Jean-Bart\u2019s reign could herald a brighter future. \u201cPlaying for Haiti, I gave my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout us players, you don\u2019t have a game. I am so happy Dadou can\u2019t abuse his power and stop us from achieving our dreams any more.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ed Aarons", "Romain Molina", "Alex Cizmic"], "keywords": ["president", "king", "haitis", "fifa", "players", "yves", "national", "haiti", "football", "ruler", "fall", "fhf", "jeanbart", "centre", "rise", "abuse", "ranch"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
