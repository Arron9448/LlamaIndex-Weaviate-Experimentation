Montauk, meet the Rocky Mountains. The Surf Lodge\u2014the electric East End hotspot known for its concerts, lobster rolls, and barely-contained Saturday chaos\u2014is heading to Aspen.

Aspen not only combines a community of incredibly interesting people, it also has that Montauk-like feeling,\u201d Surf Lodge owner Jayma Cardoso tells Vogue. \u201cSince the allure of Aspen may not be about catching the perfect wave, but rather the perfect powder, we thought it only made sense for our brand to expand as well\u2014enter \u2018The Snow Lodge.\u2019\u201d", "It\u2019s true that The Snow Lodge has shares some key facets with its Long Island brethren: Surf Lodge chef Robert Sieber is making the journey out west to serve locally-sourced Colorado cuisine: think seared river-caught fish, caviar potatoes, and gruyere fondue (but since this is Aspen, there\u2019s also a vegan version). There\u2019s also an outdoor deck with a DJ-ready stage, which is pretty much destined by the apr\u00e8s-ski gods to become the ultimate scene. Plus, it\u2019s got quite the scenic view of ski slopes and the mountain\u2019s gondola.", "And yes, they will host their immensely popular concert series\u2014which, last summer, brought in names like John Legend and R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol to Montauk\u2014at their new outpost.

Melet was inspired by alpine aesthetics in the late-1970s, which was a fascinating time for the culture of snow sports, when everyone from Hollywood stars to the American political elite started hitting the slopes. Meanwhile, a new means of bombing down the mountain was gaining popularity thanks to one Jake Burton: snowboarding. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun and sexy time period,\u201d Melet tells Vogue. He sourced a series of era-appropriate antiques: vintage boot ads, old skis, and a quilt sown with logos from the major ski resorts in Colorado. Outside, he put warm and cozy sheepskin blankets on the seats, and space heaters which he painted in pops of color. Oh, and there\u2019s also one very prominent igloo. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to hang out in. . . or to take pictures of yourself,\u201d Melet jokes.", "Overall, the goal was to create something, well, cool. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be youthful, and it\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d says Melet.", "Judging by the raging success of the Montauk outpost, The Snow Lodge\u2019s popularity is already a fait accompli."], "summary": "On December 26, they officially open \u201cThe Snow Lodge\u201d in the old Shlomo\u2019s restaurant at the base of Aspen Mountain.\n\u201cWhen we thought of places where The Surf Lodge experiment could continue to grow, Aspen was at the top of our list.\nAspen not only combines a community of incredibly interesting people, it also has that Montauk-like feeling,\u201d Surf Lodge owner Jayma Cardoso tells Vogue.\nThe Snow Lodge is partnering with legendary local music haunt, Belly Up, to book the hottest musical acts for some sure-to-be rollicking performances.\nThe exterior of The Snow Lodge.", "id": "f0a2b6e7-8458-3c4f-97a2-54a7583dca0a", "title": "Aspen, Get Ready to Apr\u00e8s Ski: The Surf Lodge Is Coming to Town", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "pubDate": null, "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/surf-lodge-opens-the-snow-lodge-in-aspen-apres-ski?mbid=social_onsite_googleplus"}
