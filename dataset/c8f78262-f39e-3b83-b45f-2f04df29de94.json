Hemingway\u2019s interest in androgyny began with her. Burns and Novick report that in bed with his fourth wife, the journalist Mary Welsh, he sometimes liked to pretend he was a girl, and that Mary was a boy. His unfinished novel \u201cThe Garden of Eden\u201d also revolves around sexual ambiguity. The book\u2019s protagonist, David Bourne, is a young writer living in France with his wife, Catherine. The couple want to be \u201cchanged,\u201d to defy gender roles and have an affair with the same woman, but David grows more and more uncomfortable with this fluidity, just as Hemingway wasn\u2019t comfortable with it in life. One of the more heartbreaking sections in \u201cHemingway\u201d is the film\u2019s description of the author\u2019s excruciating relationship with his third and youngest child, Gloria, who was born as Gregory, and lived the latter part of her life as a trans woman. Perhaps Gloria recognized some of her impulses in her father, too. In one angry letter, she called him \u201cErnestine.\u201d", "\u201cSometimes they try to catch you off guard by getting all conversational.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Frank Cotham", "After high school, Hemingway went to work as a journalist for the Kansas City Star, where he paid special attention to the style guide: \u201cUse short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English.\u201d In 1918, still hungry for experience, he volunteered to work for the Red Cross and signed on to be an ambulance driver in Italy. Just over a month into his service, Hemingway was wounded by a mortar, and spent some time recovering in a hospital in Milan. While there, he fell in love with an American nurse named Agnes von Kurowsky. When he returned to Oak Park, in 1919, it was with the understanding that he and Agnes would marry. But she soon wrote to say that she planned to marry someone else. Hemingway never got over Agnes\u2019s rejection. But he put his anguish to work. In \u201cA Farewell to Arms,\u201d his second novel, published in 1929, Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver, falls in love with Catherine Barkley, an English nurse stationed in Italy. What do the young couple believe in besides themselves, and their love, amid all that death? Realism. Frederic observes:", "If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.", "Gertrude Stein\u2019s roundelay-like syntax and logic feel very present here. \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d is about perspective and perception, and what to do with life as you\u2019re living it. Part of the sadness at the core of the film \u201cHemingway\u201d is how much life we see happening to the writer that he doesn\u2019t seem to feel, or doesn\u2019t want to feel, protecting a self he didn\u2019t know, or could not face.", "One way that he managed to have a feeling for who he was was to tell lies. When, in 1919, he returned home to Oak Park with the goal of making, he said, \u201cthe world safe for Ernest Hemingway,\u201d the boy played up his idea of heroism by giving talks for a fee, describing how he had carried a soldier to safety before he collapsed. That was fiction, his theatre. Whenever he hit the streets, he wore his uniform, including a black velvet Italian cape. That was his costume. He wanted to be known, and would be known. Like many writers, he began his life as an author by performing. But once you start telling whoppers like that you can\u2019t stop, because one lie always leads to another. On the other hand, hadn\u2019t his life\u2014with its various cruelties and manipulations\u2014begun with a lie? How could he know who he was if Grace had told him that he was something else and even dressed him for the part, or when Agnes promised an everlasting love that didn\u2019t last? Were life and, more specifically, a woman\u2019s love a fiction?", "\u201cHemingway\u201d is chock-full of writers. There\u2019s Edna O\u2019Brien on Hemingway in love, and Tobias Wolff on his influence. In the end, these opinions amount to a kind of distraction, but it\u2019s necessary filler. It\u2019s possible that Hemingway was a complicated shallow person, addicted to the high of being known to feed a continually diminishing self. As Stein mused in her 1933 book, \u201cThe Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,\u201d \u201cBut what a story that of the real Hem, and one he should tell himself but alas he never will. After all, as he himself once murmured, there is the career, the career.\u201d He took on the role of \u201cPapa\u201d\u2014a man of genial but firm paternalism, a hunter and a drinker\u2014the way an actor might embody Mark Antony, through study and persistence. Hemingway always seemed to be in the right place at the right time: Paris with the Steins and the Fitzgeralds, Gstaad with the Murphys, Spain with Ava Gardner. There was writing, and there was the fashionable life, and his great masterpieces\u2014\u201cThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,\u201d \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u201d\u2014are about fashionable lives derailed by nature, by death, and by a belief in the myth of arrival, which, ultimately, gets you nowhere. Indeed, Harry, in \u201cKilimanjaro,\u201d can\u2019t go anywhere; he has gangrene, and he\u2019s dying, and we are meant to understand that maybe Harry died a long time ago, when he couldn\u2019t become the artist he dreamt of becoming:", "Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.", "It\u2019s the comma before \u201cnow\u201d that kills me. That pause before the end. Because pauses do come before the end, and with Hemingway, as with Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, I am grateful for what is left out, for what the writer has allowed me to have to myself: my imagination, prompted by his.", "There\u2019s ugliness in Hemingway, and not the kind of ugliness meant in the documentary\u2019s opening statement about writing. Like Stein, Hemingway was not above the impulse to reduce people to types; nor did he entirely resist the pointed, class-informed racism of his time. It\u2019s hard to get through the condescending, lousy, \u201csho nuff\u201d chat in Stein\u2019s novella \u201cMelanctha,\u201d and the deeply rotten race elements in Hemingway\u2019s novel \u201cTo Have and Have Not.\u201d Those things are as much a part of America as the myth of idealized masculinity. But why a film about Hemingway now, and not, say, Faulkner? Is Faulkner not a more vibrant figure, who prefigured in his Snopes stories and novels the age of Trump and Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial, and the Gordian knot of race that continues to choke large portions of our country? In this context, Burns and Novick\u2019s \u201cHemingway\u201d feels a little anachronistic, and \u201csmells of the museums,\u201d as Stein once said of Hemingway.", "As I watched, I kept returning to Dearborn\u2019s biography to fill in details I felt I was missing, such as the observation that the ample-fleshed, boasting Grace was not unlike Gertrude Stein in body, attitude, and work ethic. Every writer is every writer they\u2019ve loved and quarrelled with who came before, as every parent is every parent they loved and quarrelled with. Hemingway was Stein and Grace and his father, too. The drama was always which person would win out.", "Revisiting his writing, I remembered it was its movement that touched me\u2014how he gets characters from one part of the room to another. Easier said than done, and one of the ways in which he separated himself from Stein. He replaced thinking with action\u2014which Stein considered an affront to modernism. \u201cGertrude Stein and Sherwood Anderson are very funny on the subject of Hemingway,\u201d Stein wrote in \u201cAlice B. Toklas.\u201d \u201cThey both agreed that they have a weakness for Hemingway because he is such a good pupil. He is a rotten pupil, I protested. You don\u2019t understand, they both said, it is flattering to have a pupil who does it without understanding it.\u201d Stein\u2019s voice and her experiments with sound are part of the spine of his work, and how gripping is that? To realize that Hemingway\u2019s famously muscular prose was born of admiration for a middle-aged lesbian\u2019s sui-generis sentences and paragraphs? Absorbing Stein\u2019s influence, and admitting to his attraction, was one way of getting at what he always longed for: to be a girl in love with a powerful woman. \u2666"], "authors": ["Hilton Als", "Hilton Al"], "keywords": ["writer", "hemingway", "stein", "myth", "documentary", "peeks", "life", "steins", "work", "love", "write", "way", "world"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
