The decision bypassed the legislature, which resumes sessions in mid-October.", "Lam said the move was designed to stop violence and restore calm, but the government was prepared for immediate protests and a weekend of escalating violence: government employees were sent home early, schools were closed early on Friday and all school activities were cancelled on Saturday. Many shopping malls, banks and businesses were also closed.", "Thousands thronged on to the streets after Lam made the announcement on Friday afternoon. After dark, crowds lit fires at two metro stations and vandalised shops and businesses regarded as being pro-China. Police threw teargas and an off-duty officer reportedly fired a live round, hitting a 14-year-old boy in the thigh, after protesters attacked him.", "Play Video 1:51 Hong Kong protesters attack metro stations after face mask ban \u2013 video", "Political analysts said the use of the emergency law signalled the start of authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city.", "Hong Kong has had civil freedoms under China\u2019s one country, two system policy since 1997. Although many have been eroded over the years, the emergency regulations were expected quickly eradicate many fundamental rights.", "\u201cThis symbolises very much the beginning of authoritarianism,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe Pandora\u2019s box is opened. This law gives the government widespread power to do anything it likes. There is no more check and balance.", "\u201cSuppression has begun, and there are no more considerations for reconciliation,\u201d he said.", "Quick guide What are the Hong Kong protests about? Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.", "Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city.

Police groups have called for a citywide curfew, and there have been talks about delaying district elections planned for November.", "Many Hongkongers fear the government could use the emergency provisions to force through unpopular proposed laws and policies, such as a subversion law that was suspended in 2003 after a mass protest, a national anthem law and the criminalisation of insults against the police.", "\u201cHong Kong has become a dictatorial government. Now the floodgate is open, they can do what they like with the infinite power they have,\u201d said an 18-year-old school leaver who wore a black face mask in protest at Lam\u2019s announcement. \u201cLike at a buffet, she picked the mask ban this time, and she is free to pick two or three more later as she wishes.\u201d", "Apart from mandating schools to close, the government closed public culture and leisure facilities on Saturday and ordered teachers to ask parents to ensure their children refrained from wearing face masks at school. Many students, mostly in secondary schools, have worn medical masks while staging anti-government protests outside their schools.", "All the metro train services remained suspended for most of Saturday, after being closed late on Friday.", "Jean-Philippe B\u00e9ja, a research emeritus professor at the centre for international studies and research at Sciences-Po in Paris, said the government was trying to \u201cscare people with an atmosphere of war\u201d and \u201cmany people will see this as a provocation\u201d.", "Analysts said the emergency measure risked fuelling an even more violent and widespread resistance.", "\u201cIt is an attempt to extinguish a fire with gasoline,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt will only make protesters more determined and militant.\u201d", "Play Video Peaceful protesters form human chains after mask ban in Hong Kong \u2013 video", "One protester, who has been demonstrating since June, said: \u201cI would keep coming out and I would keep wearing a mask.
