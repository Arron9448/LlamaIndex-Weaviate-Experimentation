He is from Andimeshk in the province of Khuzestan, and was arrested in 2015 and charged with pre-meditated murder, supposedly committed during a group brawl. It is unclear whether Iran\u2019s regime forced Hosseini to confess to a crime he did not commit.", "A NEW FRONT AGAINT IRAN FOR 2021", "Iran\u2019s opaque judiciary and penal system repeatedly tortured Afkari into admitting a killing he did not carry out, according to human rights organizations and Western governments. The clerical rulers hanged Afkari for protesting in 2018 against the economic and political corruption of the regime controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.", "\"What the European Union needs to ask themselves is, at what point do you consider a state a bad actor and take action accordingly,\" said Cohanim, who fled the Islamic Republic of Iran with her family in 1979, when she was 6, to escape its repressive state policies. \"Is it when the state underwrites terrorism and causes instability in entire regions? Is it when the state starves its own people while enriching its leadership? Is it when the state commits mass human rights violations against its own citizens?

After murdering champion wrestler Navid Afkari, the criminal regime occupying Iran intends to put fellow wrestler Mehdi Ali Hosseini to death.\"", "Khansarinia continued, \"The International Olympic Committee has as yet refused to take any serious actions against the regime in Tehran for its bloody assault against athletes, despite a coordinated campaign by Iranian athletic champions.\"", "Fox News sent multiple press queries to the IOC and United World Wrestling (UWW).

How much more evidence does the IOC and United World Wrestling need to suspend the Iranian National Olympic Committee?", "\"Both of these organizations failed to intervene to save Navid\u2019s life,\" Koehler said. \"Now they must step up to save Mehdi\u2019s life and protect all Iranian athletes. The fact that the IOC continues to neglect its duty of care for athletes by failing to take action against Iran is a gross abdication of duty. Their willingness to stand by while athletes are jailed, tortured and executed can no longer be tolerated. The IOC and UWW must act now.\"", "Khansarinia, the NUFDI policy director, said, \"We ask the nations that consider themselves friends of the Iranian people to stand with us in this struggle.
