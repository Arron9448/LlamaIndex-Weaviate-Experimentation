Although she had been crying, she admirably answered each question as well as she could: she explained that her opponent had played well but she was unable to execute her own shots. She concluded that she simply could not handle the pressure.", "It was when she was asked to explain where the pressure came from that Kenin\u2019s composure waned: \u201cI feel like everyone was always asking me: \u2018Would you want to? Do you see yourself getting [to Melbourne] and winning again?\u2019 Obviously I said yes. With the way I\u2019m playing, no.\u201d She began to cry.", "Despite Kanepi finishing last season ranked 91 places below her opponent, there was little shock at the result. Kenin was downed by one of the most brutal ball strikers on the tour. The Estonian\u2019s ability has taken her as high as 15th in the rankings and there was a time when it seemed that she had everything in her hands to be a perennial top 20 player.", "Instead, Kanepi has become the resident grand slam upset specialist. She is the name that every seed dreads and one of the few players to consistently make true on her ability to pull off a surprise victory. Her win against Kenin marks her eighth grand slam win against a top 10 player and she has compiled a winning 7-6 record against them since June 2010, with victories over Simona Halep, Caroline Wozniacki and Jelena Jankovic. Her top-10 record is 5-29 at regular WTA events. Such was her confidence against Kenin, she closed the match with three aces.", "The rise of Kenin over the past 13 months has happened precisely because of her ability to handle pressure in different contexts. Not only did she break through to win a surprise maiden slam title, but even after a pandemic disrupted the world and the tennis season was scuppered for five months, she returned to reach the Roland Garros final on her weakest surface.", "At its heart, there are few spectacular things about her game. She is a strong athlete with a pearl of a backhand, consistent depth and a resolve to never offer her opponents the same type of ball twice. What has separated her young career from players of similar styles is her ability to elevate her game in acute pressure moments. When Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza was prowling on her serve at 2-2 in the third set of their Australian Open final last year, Kenin stepped in and produced an all-time great service game by striking five winners from 0-40 down. She did not lose another game.", "Kaia Kanepi hits a return against Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images", "Kenin\u2019s departure from the Australian Open underlines the varying types of pressure in the sport and the necessity of dealing with it all. Throughout her period at the top, Kenin has been able to fly under the radar, avoiding much of the attention focused on other young players such as Coco Gauff and Amanda Anisimova. It has often been described negatively, as an error that needs to be corrected with more media attention and interest to a worthy talent. Kenin has said she uses her relative lack of interest and endorsements as motivation to improve.", "Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.", "However, not being in the spotlight has allowed Kenin the opportunity to develop her game and make early mistakes in peace. The demands and distractions that come with being a top player are always intense and the best players find a way to block out the noise and focus on their ultimate goals. How Kenin handles it in the future will determine how long she remains at the top.", "The world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, moved into the third round with a 6-1, 7-6 (7) win over Daria Gavrilova while the fifth seed, Elina Svitolina, defeated Gauff 6-4, 6-3. Heather Watson was unable to advance to the third round, falling in three sets to the No 21 seed Anett Kontaveit."], "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "keywords": ["players", "defence", "australian", "game", "tears", "brutal", "slam", "kenin", "title", "win", "open", "sofia", "end", "kanepi", "ability", "pressure"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
