After sliding your badge into a reader, you smile and nod, even though you know \u201cAmy\u201d is not a real person. You sit down at your cubicle and start browsing the web.", "Then the trouble starts.", "You receive an email requesting a meeting. \u201cBob\u201d wants to chat about your job performance. You fire up a Zoom chat and another digital avatar appears on the screen.", "WIRED OPINION ABOUT John Brandon is a writer and columnist based in Minneapolis.", "\u201cI have some unfortunate news for you, today \u2026 \u201d says the middle-aged man wearing bifocals. He looks real and talks like a human, and all of his facial expressions seem realistic. There is no uncanny valley, just a bored-looking avatar who\u2019s about to fire you.", "Recently, at CES 2020, a company called Neon (which is owned by Samsung subsidiary Star Labs) introduced digital avatars, which are called Neons. Based on real humans but fully digitized, they don\u2019t have that awkward cartoon-like appearance of less-detailed replicants. Details were scarce, and the demo was highly controlled. But a press release trumpeted that \u201cNeons will be our friends, collaborators, and companions, continually learning, evolving, and forming memories from their interactions.\u201d And among the avatars on display were a digital police officer, someone who looked like an accountant, an engineer, and a few office workers. Some looked authoritative, even stern.", "I imagined, like some of Neon\u2019s potential clients may imagine, one of them being a boss. Unless you look up close, you can\u2019t tell Neons are not real people. Maybe \u201cBob\u201d and other bots will laugh, cough, roll their eyes, or furrow their brows.", "Some might even act like they are in charge of something.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am going to have to let you go today. Do you have any questions?\u201d he says.", "Well, yes, many. The first one is: Does it really count?", "Ethicists have argued for years that a digital avatar is not a real human and is not entitled to the same rights and privileges as the rest of us. You might wonder if that works both ways. Are you entitled to ignore what a fake human tells you? Let\u2019s look at one possible not-so-distant scenario: Can a digital avatar fire you?", "In the workplace, it\u2019s not like an avatar needs a W2 or a Herman Miller chair. What, exactly, is \u201cBob\u201d? On the Zoom screen, it\u2019s a collection of pixels programmed to trigger a visual pattern, one that we perceive as a human. Algorithms determine the response, so a human is always behind the response. Someone has to create the code to determine whether \u201cBob\u201d gets angry or chooses to listen intently. In fact, Neon announced a development platform called Spectra that controls emotions, intelligence, and behavior."], "authors": ["John Brandon", "John Brando"], "keywords": ["avatar", "today", "called", "response", "real", "digital", "zoom", "neons", "bob", "human"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
