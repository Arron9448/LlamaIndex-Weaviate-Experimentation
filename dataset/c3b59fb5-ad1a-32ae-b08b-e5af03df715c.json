McMurran, a charge nurse in the intensive-care unit of a hospital in Lodi, was helping a respiratory therapist intubate the woman, whose breathing had become so labored that the staff feared for her life. Before the tube entered the woman\u2019s mouth and rendered her speechless, she squeezed McMurran\u2019s hand and spoke what could have been her last words. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful for everything you have done for me,\u201d McMurran recalls the woman saying.", "These may be the waning months of the coronavirus pandemic\u2014the vaccine now shot into the arms of thousands of medical-health professionals available to the rest of us soon\u2014but scenes like this will play in McMurran\u2019s mind for a lifetime: brief cracks of light and human tenderness amid the despair.", "Yet, even now, as the agonizingly drawn out final act of the pandemic begins, the public fails to adequately grasp what\u2019s transpiring in I.C.U.s around the country. What COVID-19 \u201cactually does to a person is hard for people not within a hospital setting to fully understand,\u201d McMurran told me. \u201cI mean, to watch them slowly suffocate, and not be able to do anything about it . . . .\u201d", "As cheery headlines about vaccines scroll across cable-news screens, the virus rages around the county. California recently hit a record sixty thousand new single-day cases. In the San Joaquin Valley region, where McMurran works, dangerously low numbers of available I.C.U. beds triggered Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order, which went into effect at midnight on December 6th. In-person dining was banned, along with indoor mingling of people from separate households. The mandate also shuttered hair and nail salons, gyms, and many other in-person services.", "Hours later, a couple of dozen protesters, many of them business owners, gathered in Stockton, the seat of San Joaquin County. Many were maskless as they mounted the steps of City Hall to perform a routine almost as old as the pandemic itself. No, they would not obey Newsom\u2019s order, the protesters announced. \u201cI\u2019m not going to close,\u201d a restaurant owner said, microphone in hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about getting sick, don\u2019t go into my restaurant.\u201d Later, still maskless, he ladled free cups of clam chowder from a vat to passersby on City Hall grounds.", "The protesters soon entered the building, mostly barefaced, tightly packed in close quarters, and demanded to speak with the city\u2019s elected officials. In footage captured by a reporter for the Stockton Record, a woman in a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d hat lifts a bullhorn to chant, \u201cWe demand to be a sanctuary city for businesses. If we can be a sanctuary city for drug addicts, and for illegal aliens, we can be a sanctuary city for businesses.\u201d", "The contrast between demonstrations like this and the scenes inside intensive-care units couldn\u2019t be starker. As the protest unfolded, area hospitals careened toward disaster. By the end of the next day, I.C.U. capacity in San Joaquin County hit zero per cent\u2014meaning that the demand for beds at the county\u2019s seven hospitals exceeded availability. At Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, where Erika McMurran works, there were thirty-eight patients with COVID-19 (and forty-four by week\u2019s end). At St. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center, in Stockton, there were eighty-seven COVID-19 patients (a hundred and nine by week\u2019s end). The region hadn\u2019t flattened the curve, so much as erected a near-vertical line.", "\u201cHeavy,\u201d is how Scott Neeley described the situation at his hospital to me. He\u2019s the chief medical officer at St. Joseph\u2019s and a pulmonary and critical-care specialist with more than thirty years of experience. \u201cNone of us have ever seen anything like this,\u201d he said.", "The San Joaquin Valley is an emerald gash shaped like a fist in the middle of the state. It abuts the Sierra Nevada mountains and drinks in the rivers that zag from the foothills. Looked upon from an airplane cabin window at thirty thousand feet, the valley appears as a medley of pixels in every shade of green; irrigated fields collide at improbable angles. On the ground, viewed from a speeding car on Highway 99, it\u2019s a blur of corduroy\u2014rows of garlic, tomatoes, and fruit trees sprouting from the rich, dark loam. The San Joaquin Valley is California\u2019s bread basket, the source of the state\u2019s bounty, the source of much of the country\u2019s bounty. Even the names of towns that dot this verdant blanket sound fecund: Chowchilla, Planada, Ripon.", "These townships orbit midsize cities with populations exceeding three hundred thousand\u2014Fresno, Bakersfield, Stockton\u2014but the region is mostly rural and agricultural. Its demographics reflect that. Of the more than four million people in the valley, many are migrant workers. A hundred and twelve thousand are believed to be undocumented. At the same time, the region skews further right politically than most of California. In the 2020 Presidential election, half of the valley\u2019s eight counties voted for Donald Trump; in the four counties that went for Joe Biden, the Democrat won by margins far narrower than that by which he won the state as a whole.", "The coronavirus exacerbates the valley\u2019s long existing divisions and pain points, says Nancy Burke, a public-health professor at the University of California, Merced. \u201cThe health indicators rival the poorest parts of Appalachia,\u201d she told me. The counties in San Joaquin Valley \u201crank among the lowest in California in terms of health outcomes, as well as determinants of health, [such as] social and economic factors.\u201d Forty-one per cent of rural residents in the region are covered by Medi-Cal, the state health insurance that is available to Californians living below the federal poverty line. So, although the region produces much of the nation\u2019s food supply, Burke explained, the people here suffer some of the highest rates of food insecurity in the state.", "Demands for I.C.U. beds at Adventist Health Lodi Memorial and other area hospitals are now exceeding supply. Photograph by Staff Sgt. Eddie Siguenza / Army National Guard / Reuters", "Add a global pandemic to the valley\u2019s pre\u00ebxisting economic disparities and political frictions, and you get what\u2019s unfolding now. You get sheriffs announcing that they won\u2019t enforce state measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus, as happened in Merced County, where Burke works. You get barefaced protesters who demand that their town be declared \u201ca sanctuary city for businesses.\u201d", "Newsom\u2019s lockdown order lasts at least three weeks and is triggered in each of the state\u2019s five geographic regions when the I.C.U. bed capacity there falls below fifteen per cent. (So far, only one region, Northern California, has not fallen below that threshold.) In addition to banning in-person dining and services and gathering among separate households, the lockdown forbids guest visits at breweries and wineries. Retail stores can remain open, but at only twenty per cent capacity. Restaurants can offer only delivery and pickup.", "It\u2019s within that last provision that Jennifer Pappas is trying to hang on. She and her husband own Papapavlo\u2019s Bistro & Bar, in Stockton, a restaurant, catering business, and event space that has served locals Mediterranean-inflected fare for decades. When the pandemic first hit, Papapavlo\u2019s restaurant quickly transformed into Papapavlo\u2019s food delivery. The couple and three of their offspring\u2014in their late teens and early twenties\u2014became a distribution staff overnight. \u201cEvery kid would have a car,\u201d Pappas told me, \u201cand we would just load up their cars with deliveries.\u201d", "The restaurant survived, but margins were thinner than ever in an industry infamous for thin margins. Pappas doesn\u2019t know what this latest lockdown might spell. She didn\u2019t join the protesters at City Hall earlier this month, but she said that she agrees with much of the cause. \u201cAre they trying to make us go out of business?\u201d she wondered aloud about the policymakers behind the stay-at-home-order. Among her frustrations are what seem to her to be the arbitrariness of the rules. Why, for instance, do big chain stores get a pass? \u201cI mean, you\u2019re running into more strangers and people in those grocery stores and Costco and Target, for sure, than at a restaurant,\u201d she said.", "Then, there\u2019s the hypocrisy of the elected officials who have been caught on camera defying the state public-health guidelines that they vehemently urge their constituents to obey. In November, photos surfaced of Newsom dining with a large group at the tony French Laundry, in Napa Valley. State legislators have been caught in similar acts. \u201cThey\u2019re flaunting it in everybody\u2019s face, which is kind of frustrating,\u201d Douglass Wilhoit, the C.E.O. of the Greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce, told me. \u201cAbout twenty-eight per cent of the businesses we had in 2019 or early 2020 have closed for good.\u201d", "Several members of his organization took part in the protest at Stockton\u2019s city hall. Wilhoit says that he takes the pandemic and the guidelines seriously\u2014he\u2019s in his late seventies and considers himself vulnerable to the virus\u2014but he understands where his members are coming from. \u201cWhen it affects you personally with your business, your livelihood, your family, your employees, it becomes very, very personal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think that a lot of people understand, possibly, the reason\u2014but when it hits home, it makes it more difficult to comply.\u201d", "Much of what\u2019s happening in the San Joaquin Valley mirrors the situation in California at large. How is it that the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, the state with some of the strictest lockdown protocols in the country, remains such a hotbed of new COVID-19 cases? There are no easy answers, Burke, the U.C. Merced professor, admitted to me.", "Those who do look to state and local leaders for guidance receive mixed messages\u2014everything from the variability of lockdown rules to images of a maskless governor treating himself to a group meal at a posh restaurant. \u201cThe reality is that some of these recommendations are out of reach for a large proportion of our state\u2019s population who are unable to work from home and are marginally housed,\u201d Burke said.", "For some, the pandemic\u2019s economic ruin spurs defiance against public-health measures, even denial of the virus and its dangers. Meanwhile, those dangers play out, fatally, behind hospital walls.", "That split troubles Neeley, the chief medical officer at St. Joseph\u2019s. \u201cThe disconnect between the way people are behaving, the way people are talking about this, the way people are ignoring the science, the way people are saying things like, \u2018I hear people are dying of all sorts of things and they\u2019re calling it COVID,\u2019 and then we go to work and we see a young family losing their mother,\u201d Neeley told me recently by Zoom, \u201cthat\u2019s devastating.\u201d", "As of this writing, a hundred and thirty-one people are being treated for COVID-19 at Neeley\u2019s hospital. The number of patients with symptoms severe enough to need I.C.U. beds puts the hospital at nearly fifty per cent over capacity, according to Neeley, forcing staff to convert other beds in other wings into I.C.U. beds. \u201cThis is a clinical scenario like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen in our careers\u2014ten or twenty or thirty times the number of just horribly ill patients that we would normally see in a year,\u201d he said.", "Thirteen miles away, Erika McMurran, the I.C.U. charge nurse at Lodi Memorial, reflected on how, a week earlier, she had placed her palm on the back of a man as he struggled to turn himself over onto his stomach so he could breathe. His adult daughter, her face beamed on a computer screen provided by the I.C.U., spoke to him while McMurran rubbed his back; both women working in tandem\u2014comforting the patient with words and human touch. \u201cI just want to go home,\u201d the man said, in pain and gasping for air. \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d", "If these truly are the final months of the coronavirus, if the vaccine now being administered ushers in the encouraging but slow end to the pandemic, McMurran will still hold in her mind a process she wishes she\u2019d never had to memorize. \u201cYou knew the next step that was coming for a patient,\u201d she told me, speaking in the past tense, as if we were both already living in that dreamed-about future. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be like, \u2018O.K., in two days, this is what this patient\u2019s going to do.\u2019 \u201d A fever or full-body aches or feeling so weak that they can\u2019t turn onto their stomachs unaided. \u201cYet you couldn\u2019t do anything to stop that patient from hitting the next step.\u201d The predictability became its own variety of horror.", "Then came one unpredictable thing. It wasn\u2019t as directly hopeful as a vaccine. No one\u2019s winning a prize for it. But it was a glimmer of something that could help us climb out of the pandemic, something you\u2019d never guess would happen if you\u2019d been watching scenes like the one at Stockton\u2019s city hall during the past ten months: a changed mind."], "authors": ["James Ross Gardner", "James Ross Gardne", "Anna Russel", "James Carrol"], "keywords": ["epicenter", "rage", "arrives", "san", "restaurant", "coronavirus", "california", "vaccine", "valley", "icu", "city", "pandemic", "region", "state", "mcmurran", "denial", "told", "death"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
