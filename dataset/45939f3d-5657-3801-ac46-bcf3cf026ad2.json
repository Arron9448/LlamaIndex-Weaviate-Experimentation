The window of his makeshift bedroom recording studio looks out over the Holme Wood estate. Horses\u2014which belong to the \u201cCharvas\u201d, Bradford\u2019s settled traveller community\u2014roam the streets like dogs. \u201cThis is our culture. It\u2019s like London rappers showing high-rise flats in their videos,\u201d says Blazer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that. Round here it\u2019s like kids driving around with shotguns on flippin\u2019 horses.\u201d", "Grime, a genre of hip-hop known for its rapid breakbeats, emerged in east London in the early 2000s. Its biggest stars, including Stormzy, still hail from the capital. Yet grime is now a national soundtrack. Online commenters poke fun at white youths in Blackpool or Wigan for appropriating the culture of black Londoners, but these rappers are a source of intense local pride.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "The scenes have much in common, sharing roots in deprivation. Since the decline of its woollen industry, Bradford has lacked jobs. West Yorkshire has the highest rate of violent crime in England. Grime is something to latch onto. Teenagers congregate in the city\u2019s bus terminal, says Blazer. \u201cEverybody sits at the back and spits bars and shares them on Bluetooth.\u201d Without grime, \u201cwe have two options: break our backs for ever in a warehouse, or sell drugs and go to jail. We want to make music an option for other Bradford people, like it is in London.\u201d", "As in London, critics argue that grime means crime. Grime lyrics, with their bleak social realism, sometimes spill into outright provocation. In September Asco, a rapper from Gillingham, was jailed for 12 years for drug-dealing. Other provincial rappers argue they are merely reflecting society back to itself.", "Yet northern grime is distinctively northern. One of Blazer\u2019s tracks, \u201cLocal\u201d, translates London slang into its northern equivalent. \u201cEverybody says they trap, but here up north yeah we do rounds,\u201d he raps, referring to drug-dealing. Many grime artists want to defend their home towns. \u201cPeople just have a made-up image of Derby,\u201d says MC Eyez. \u201cThey think it\u2019s just farms and trees. I have to let the music speak, so they hear it and say, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s a lot of crime and multiculturalism up there\u2019.\u201d MC S see themselves as representatives. As Eyez raps: \u201cMan know that I put Darbz on the atlas.\u201d", "Others emphasise their city\u2019s diversity, hoping to debunk stereotypes about the anti-immigrant attitudes of northern Brexiteers. \u201cI want people to respect Leicester\u2019s identity as an example of how multiculturalism can work,\u201d says Kamakaze, a white rapper from one of Britain\u2019s most diverse cities. \u201cWhite man will never know what the underhand is / I mean look what our country was built on,\u201d he raps. In Bradford, which experienced race riots in 2001, Blazer argues that grime is bringing people together. \u201cWhat overrides race is the class system. We\u2019re all lower class.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["raps", "crime", "bradford", "blazer", "grime", "white", "northern", "s", "rappers", "bradfordstyle", "london", "music"], "id": "45939f3d-5657-3801-ac46-bcf3cf026ad2", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/12/14/grime-music-bradford-style"}
