The call\u2019s chat box filled up with names, pronouns, and affiliations, including ten different New York chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America (the rose is the group\u2019s logo), from Buffalo to Nassau County. \u201cBig statewide energy,\u201d Stephanie Lemieux, from Brooklyn, wrote. The attendees were volunteers, and their mission was to phone-bank registered voters and ask if they supported taxing the rich.", "In December, the six socialist members of the state legislature, staring down a multibillion-dollar deficit and incensed by Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s quiet defunding of social services (Medicaid, housing) during the pandemic, began advocating for a series of levies on corporations and on the one-to-five per cent (starting with single New Yorkers who earn more than three hundred thousand dollars a year). The legislators helped launch the Tax the Rich campaign, which, working with a coalition of progressive groups, aims to add fifty billion dollars a year to the state treasury.", "On the Zoom call, Bobby Gross, a square-jawed socialist who works as a political economist, outlined the endgame: The state\u2019s budget would be ratified in a few days, and a tax hike of seven billion dollars had already been proposed by the State Senate and Assembly\u2014if the increase survived, it would be the largest ever in New York. The goal was to get residents on the phone, persuade them with a pitch, and then patch them through to the offices of lawmakers in Albany, to leave voice mails in support of taxing the rich. The messages, Gross said, would keep pressure on the speaker, Carl Heastie, and the majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the two legislators who were designated to \u201cmeet with Cuomo behind closed doors, or, like, in their private WhatsApp group.\u201d He went on, \u201cWe need to keep the fire on them, so that they don\u2019t give big concessions over to Cuomo, which is what normally happens.\u201d The day\u2019s target areas were Westchester, the Bronx, and the East Side of Manhattan.", "An auto-dial program connected volunteers, who had muted themselves on Zoom, with voters. They updated their fellow-callers in the chat box: \u201clol someone just said \u2018boi bye\u2019 and hung up\u201d; \u201cOMG just had the BEST CALL with Larry Sr. (he asked me if I wanted Larry Jr. or Larry Sr. and I told him, whoever wants to Tax the Rich!).\u201d A volunteer named James Cole got a woman who said she\u2019d been close to Speaker Heastie\u2019s mother\u2014she left the Speaker \u201ca voicemail saying that Heastie\u2019s mom would be very disappointed in him, lol.\u201d", "As the auto-dialler moved through Westchester, Lemieux reached several people who were all for taxing the rich, as long as it wasn\u2019t them. \u201cThey\u2019re, like, \u2018Well, I want everyone to have a good quality of life and be able to access schools, hospitals, good transit, and all that,\u2019 \u201d Lemieux said. \u201c \u2018But, I just don\u2019t know, why can\u2019t you have a threshold that\u2019s, like, five hundred thousand or a million?\u2019 \u201d Three hundred thousand dollars, the Westchesterites suggested, didn\u2019t make you rich in New York.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a rough argument,\u201d Kelly Cahill said. \u201cI\u2019m from Long Island, and we get that a lot.\u201d", "\u201cClearly capitalism doesn\u2019t even work for the rich,\u201d Bran Acton-Bond observed. \u201cBecause they feel oppressed!\u201d", "One obstacle for the callers was being lumped in with telemarketers. Brandon Medina found some success with the line \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for money, just voice mails.\u201d A few women politely said that they did not take solicitations of any kind.", "Gross connected with a middle-aged Scarsdale resident named Kenneth, who at first complained that the pitch was too vague. Gross laughed and told him, \u201cI had to start a little broad, because there are actually six different tax bills that would raise, in total, tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue, to fund infrastructure, hospitals, schools, etc. I\u2019d be happy\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2014So you\u2019re saying my taxes should go up?\u201d", "\u201cTo go through that in detail . . .

Listening to you detail six different tax bills is not one of them.\u201d", "Despite the short tempers and the hangups, the volunteers were able to transfer almost a hundred people to their representatives\u2019 mailboxes, to leave voice mails. But what buoyed them most was the opportunity for political education. \u201cA lot of working-class calls that I got just didn\u2019t know about Cuomo cutting public services,\u201d a phone-banker named Luke Sullivan wrote in the chat.", "Jeremy Joseph concurred: \u201cYeah some lady responded, \u2018Cuomo\u2019s not doing that!
