compromise.\nYou're not gonna give people meat slurry,how are do you make it have a meat physicality,the three dimensional aspect of it?\nYou're still, what you're describing in your clean

"paragraphs": ["Transcript", "[upbeat music]", "Thank you.", "Hi.", "Hi.", "Never follow children.", "[both laughing]", "Especially the ones that make you cry.", "I don't get makeup on a lot,", "but I got it back and now my makeup's running.", "[laughing]", "It's terrible.", "Thank you for being here today.", "We're talking now with a couple of folks", "who are trying to change something fundamental", "about what all of us do every day, which is eating.", "Traci Des Jardins is one of the great Bay Area chefs", "and is a consultant for a company that you may have heard of", "called Impossible Foods.", "How many of you have tried an impossible burger?", "That's almost everybody has tried that, which is cool.", "So one of the first places they were available", "was at one of Traci's restaurants here in town.", "You can also go across the street to", "Mijita in the Ferry Building doesn't have them.", "No, that's the only one that doesn't have them.", "Yeah, sorry, you'll have to venture out to the Presidio", "to some of the others.", "And Uma Valeti is the CEO and co-founder of a company", "based in Berkeley.", "You might be able to see that bridge outside.", "That goes to another city on the other side of the bay", "where he's working for a company called Memphis Meats,", "which is growing meat from cells.", "In an early iteration of the description", "that we were gonna put in the program for this talk,", "one of us, could've been me, used the term", "fake meat and very quickly--", "You got slapped on the wrist.", "Everybody was like That is a pejorative term", "[laughing]", "which sure, I can see that", "but let me turn that around and say", "alright well we don't use that term so", "what is wrong with meat that", "one carves off of a living animal", "and then cooks and serves.", "And then what's the alternative?", "I'll take this.", "We have so meats being a part of a tradition humanity", "for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years right,", "so it's a fundamental part of every culture", "more than 90% of the world", "chooses to eat meat every single day.", "So we're producing 750 billion pounds of meat today", "and the demand for that is doubling by 2050", "so that means we're gonna have to go to", "1.5 trillion pounds a year of meat production", "that's 150 billion animals if you take that out.", "Where is the space to produce all this meat", "and the love for meat is universal", "but if you want to continue the tradition of", "eating meat and you know our grandchildren", "want to be able to say yeah we eat meat", "you've got to be able to produce", "it a very different way that's scalable and sustainable.", "So if you can carve meat off an animal", "and be able to preserve it for ten billion people,", "go for it, but I don't think the planet's gonna survive,", "right, but if you want to keep the tradition alive,", "I think there's a way to do this and that's the way", "we've been working on it, Memphis Meats,", "from the last 3 1/2 years ago.", "The idea really came from", "is it sustainable to produce meat", "the way we've been doing it.", "And the answer to us was an absolute resounding no,", "and Impossible Foods and other companies", "are based on the same premise.", "And the simple idea is", "what if you can grow meat from cells?", "The only job of those cells is to become meat,", "not run around have babies, heal broken bones", "but their entire job is to be high quality meat", "beef, chicken, duck,", "and these are coming from animal cells.", "Our meat is meat, our beef is beef, our chicken is chicken,", "and that makes it really scalable for", "10 x or 100 x in the future.", "So if you can lay down the problems", "and say livestock raised for eating", "are the main source of methane on Earth,", "the most potent greenhouse gas their,", "I wrote down the bullet points", "of how terrible everything was in the world.", "They take too much land, too much money, too much energy.", "[Traci] Water.", "Too much water, they're common,", "there's knock on pollutant effects,", "depending on how you feel about animals", "it's unethical in the first place.", "I should have asked this too,", "how many people here are vegetarians?", "It's like a third of the room,", "so that's interesting too.", "So then what are the technologies that you can use", "to address that?", "Impossible has this approach that does", "sort of a plant based that uses a plant based protein", "but then adds on another technological layer.", "Why don't you describe what that is.", "Yes so Pat Brown set off to", "give people an alternative who loved meat", "not vegetarians, but people who really,", "for any variety of reasons, mostly climate change", "wanted an alternative and he knew that", "he wouldn't be able to impact the market", "unless he was able to create something that was", "craveable in the same way that meat is.", "And so he set off to look for different plant proteins", "that would replace the different aspects of meat", "and came upon the combination that we are currently using", "and heme is one of the magical ingredients there", "which acts like basically like blood", "and goes through the maillard reaction", "and changes from red to brown and", "creates some of those craveable aromas and flavors", "that people look for when they're looking for meat.", "Umami flavors.", "The umami, yes, all those craveable flavors.", "So Impossible is soy and coconut oils", "and then the heme is from a", "genetically engineered yeast that makes the heme", "then that gets mixed in.", "That's correct, yes.", "And the Memphis products are starting from", "stem cells from different animal stem cells,", "right that you're--", "Yeah so it's already in the meat that everyone's eating.", "There's some cells in the chicken breast or steak", "that can continue to renew themselves", "so we identified this high quality animal,", "and the cells from those animals,", "and we grow them outside the animal,", "but we give them the essential nutrients", "that an animal needs to grow.", "So it includes a combination of,", "amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, minerals,", "vitamins, oxygen, and water.", "And just like an animal requires different feeds", "to become mature for meat production,", "our cells require different combination of same nutrients.", "So in a clean environment, and that's the big difference,", "it's still meat but without slaughter", "and I think that's what we talk about,", "get real meat without compromise.", "Yeah you've got this sort of deconstructed", "set of all the inputs that would go into it.", "It's a very engineering way to think about", "the food, isn't it?", "Where you take sort of all the inputs", "and then go and sort of shake it all up", "and then there's your T-bone.", "It absolutely you can approach it from engineering.", "Here's the thing, the cells are natural and biologically", "they do what they're supposed to do", "and they take these ingredients", "and they have a natural program within them", "that makes them double, and double, and double", "just like they're in an animal.", "And that's what we're leveraging.", "They do but I wanna ask this about both products,", "is that if that's all there was to it", "then you're saying that likes it's easy", "but of course not, you're not commercial yet", "it's not that easy,", "it took a long time to get Impossible to market,", "there've been several alliterations of what Impossible is", "because part of the experience of eating that", "these meats is the texture and the different kinds of cells.", "So, and I wanna do this both,", "but we talked a little bit", "about this backstage before coming on", "that there was a process issue when Impossible", "went to Burger King about the patties actually breaking", "and you could tune, that the people who made it,", "could tune what the patty did.", "So how do you get it to not just have meat-like,", "to not be just meat-esque", "but to have the qualities of a hamburger patty", "that people would want.", "I mean all of that is researched", "within the walls of Impossible Foods", "and data input, I mean, we've had tastings", "and tons and tons of data that we've created around", "what makes meat taste like meat.", "That was the starting point, was to figure that out,", "and then being able to pull those things", "from the plant world and iterate", "and get to a point where you have", "all of the sensations, the mouth feel,", "the connective tissues, the fat,", "all of those different elements,", "and flavor, obviously and highly researched", "and put together to make this amazing product.", "So what was that like on your grill,", "when they come to you and say", "We're trying this, help us out,", "we haven't gone to market yet.", "What are you seeing here, when you get it", "what was the experience like for you working with it?", "And what did you go back to them with and say", "You gotta turn this one dial,", "I don't know what is, so that I can do this with it.", "By the time that I was presented", "with the first Impossible Burger,", "it was pretty much the way that it is now,", "and they were really, minor iterations", "that happened from that point forward.", "The product was already very well put together", "at that point in time.", "So that was 3 1/2 years ago before we even went to market.", "There was a different protein source though.", "It was wheat protein and now it's soy protein.", "But the coconut fat,", "a lot of the aspects of it were the same.", "Alright.", "And so before you started Memphis Meats,", "you were a cardiologist over at Cockscomb,", "a few blocks away from here", "it's possible to get a beef heart tartare,", "it has a very different texture, and flavor, and aroma", "than the hamburger that you can buy there,", "the ham-steak burger that you can get there.", "Different kinds of muscle,", "is what we're talking about here, right?", "taste and feel very different when you eat them.", "You're not gonna give people meat slurry,", "how are do you make it have a meat physicality,", "the three dimensional aspect of it?", "Absolutely, the idea for this company", "actually came from my work in cardiology.", "I was working on a--", "[Adam] That's gross actually.", "[audience laughing]", "But the best ideas come from places where", "you actually do a lot-- It wasn't during surgery", "was it?", "It wasn't like where you're like", "You know what would be good?", "[audience laughing]", "Let me tell the story, like a 30 second detour.", "[Adam and audience laughing]", "Okay so I was working in cariology,", "working on patients with heart attacks", "or cardiac arrests and I'll tell you", "there's nothing more satisfying", "than bringing the patient back to life", "after they've been declared non-resuscitative or dead", "and they've resuscitative on the field for 90 minutes", "and you bring them back,", "you open they're arteries and then you get flow back", "and I was injecting stem cells into the patients' hearts", "to regrow heart muscle.", "So that's kind of where the idea came from.", "Can you grow food from cells?", "And then I started thinking about this more and more", "over the last 10 years, could not get it our of my head", "and I talked to every scientist, engineer in the field", "and the answer was yes it can be done", "but no one was doing it.", "In fact, I talked to Pat Brown and Ethan Brown", "and said You gotta start these companies because", "we need options, we need choices.", "The reason I did not start a plant based company is", "I think the plant based protein world", "is going continue to increase,", "but I just didn't get conviction", "that the world is going", "to become predominately vegetarian.", "And I thought if you got to replace meat with meat,", "it's got to be meat.", "So that's kinda where the idea came from", "and okay, we can grow fat cells,", "we can grow connectivity tissues cells,", "we can grow muscle cells,", "and we can take it from high quality animals,", "meat, poultry, or seafood", "and starting to putting it in a small research setting,", "and decided that it should not be in academia,", "it should in the real world.", "But do they grow, this is a technical question,", "are they growing on a scaffold", "that are they growing in a shape, I mean people,", "I will grant you I am a carnivore, I am not a vegetarian", "but I think there's a pretty big difference between", "the New York strip and the filet", "and those are things that we would think", "are sort of the same muscle much less", "sort of all the different kind of cell types", "that you're talking about.", "So what we're really talking about here", "is a lot of different cell types in one place,", "growing in a matrix of other kinds of cells.", "That's not something that I guess I would ask.", "Memphis Meats still isn't commercial,", "you're looking into a lot of different meat types", "but there's still", "the last time anybody asked, I think,", "the price of the meatball had gone from being", "$2400 a meatball to something", "orders of magnitude less you said.", "[Valeti] Yep.", "I'm gonna do it, sorry.", "[Valeti] Ask me.", "Where's the beef man?", "[audience laughing]", "Okay, the beef is in Berkeley,", "if you wanna come over the bridge. [laughing]", "There's beef, there's chicken", "and there's duck. I apologize a little bit,", "I admit it.", "You're our neighbor", "so you should come over. Yeah I know, I'll come by,", "no I'm looking forward to lunch.", "So we've got beef, chicken, and duck.", "And the products we've done", "are ready to go to market.", "We've done hundreds of these tastings privately.", "The reason we are not on the market is", "we are in the process of building a pilot plant.", "And the reason for building a pilot plant", "is you want to have purity of your production,", "you want to have consistent production capabilities,", "and the product has to be of high quality,", "and we had to do it every single time", "and can promise to your consumer", "that you'll get this on a regular basis.", "So that's the stage we are in,", "but we've done products that let's say if it's", "being cooked next door,", "you'll actually smell, it's meat,", "you had to walk over there and say", "Is that chicken, duck, or beef?", "I am smelling it right now.", "When you see it being cooked on a pan", "it sears like what you'd expect,", "it's gonna have a browning reaction,", "the maillard reaction, and then when you cut it", "you see the muscle fibers,", "when you bite it you're gonna feel the chew on it,", "the elastic, the collagen, and the muscle", "all of them coming together,", "you actually are tearing into the meat.", "So that means we've got texture", "with our own scaffolds", "internal scaffolds of the cells also make scaffolds", "it's self organized,", "very similar to what they do in an animal.", "And I'll say our initial products,", "will absolutely be products people fall in love with", "because it is going to make it very familiar", "to what they're used to", "but we're not going to go after", "every single product right away.", "The T-bone, we're not working on bone right now", "for instance, I'm sure that requires a very", "different type of production.", "But ultimately, this is a platform,", "over the next 10 years,", "I see various products coming off this line,", "and the iteration cycle is much shorter.", "For example if you want to grow a trait", "in an animal, it takes seven years to selective breeding", "to get that trait.", "It takes us days to weeks to identify the cells", "with the same traits,", "so the speed of innovation is incredible", "I think it's only a matter of time", "of how we bring these products to market.", "Traci I have to assume that when you're receiving", "ingredients into one of your kitchens,", "very carefully maintained,", "you're looking just for exactly these qualities", "deciding between different ranches, for example,", "for the meat that you serve", "plus the deciding between, I suppose, plant based proteins", "if you weren't working for Impossible,", "maybe Beyond would make sense.", "Do you see those traits", "evolving to the place", "where meat eaters would choose these", "because they are simply delicious?", "I'm asking this for a particular reason, but--", "Right, I mean people make choices for all kinds", "of reasons, right?", "It can be ethical,", "it can be taste, it can be health,", "it can be any number of consumer behavior", "that takes them down the road to making a choice.", "But I think as a chef,", "I'm always thinking about flavor, right,", "and texture and if a product doesn't", "taste delicious, nobody's gonna want it.", "And so that is, when we're choosing,", "that's the first criteria that we're looking at", "is is this delicious.", "And I think with the Impossible Burger,", "we've hit the nail on the head.", "People respond to it very, very positively.", "Well both of you are talking about it,", "when you're talking about it using these products,", "not just as something that will be delicious", "for someone to eat at a high end San Francisco restraint", "but as a world changing", "climate change solution, ethical solution,", "that's talking about doing this at scale", "even vaster scales than what Impossible", "is evolving into working with Burger King.", "But I want to read you something,", "I found this looking around, this is from a 2017 article", "from Trends in Food Science & Technology,", "I get it at home,", "[Uma and audience laughing]", "it's an article called", "Consumer Perception and Behavior Regarding", "Sustainable Protein Consumption,", "you probably might have seen this,", "but the highlights of this", "Consumers underestimate the environmental impact", "of meat consumption, the willingness to change meat", "consumption behavior is low, willingness to replace meat", "with meat substitutes: insects or cultured meat,", "insects are another option for proteins, right,", "in chapulines with tequila you've had that,", "so sophisticated very audience,", "probably had that at Mijita,", "is low studies that explore motivational aspects", "of sustainable food choices are needed.", "What this study is saying is, yeah, no", "people aren't gonna eat this stuff.", "So, how can you--", "Aren't gonna eat which stuff?", "Aren't gonna eat either, I think.", "Now it's weird to say that considering the Impossible", "is now available in stores and it's available", "at fast food places", "and it's available at restaurants like yours,", "this does seem to say that there's", "widespread skepticism at least.", "How do you get past that and scale to a thing", "where this is world changing,", "not just an interesting thing that I can order at", "in the Presidio or wherever you're gonna start selling?", "This brings me back to what Chris Crox was just saying,", "What is truth to you", "may not be truth to someone else,", "and I think it's really--", "Did you just fake news a journal article?", "This is a peer reviewed man.", "[all laughing]", "For every article like this,", "I can show you 10 that say that millennials and gen Z's", "can't wait to get their hands on meat", "that is produced in scalable, sustainable way.", "I talk to my kids, one of the promises I made to my daughter", "is by the time she graduates from high school,", "we'll have fried chicken for her friends for graduation,", "but we'll be producing the chicken", "directly from chicken cells", "not having to raise and slaughter a chicken, right.", "I come to work, I have a lot of our team members saying", "When are we gonna to market?", "when I go home my daughter is saying,", "When are you gonna go to market?", "I know I am putting the same pressure,", "and now I feel bad.", "But there' a lot of surveys that very clearly say", "if option is available, choice is available,", "you'll be surprised to see how many people", "would make the choice.", "All we are saying is we're are a an solution,", "not an all solution.", "There will always be commercial meat,", "people will be raising animals and supplying", "and there'll be people that'll buy it.", "But there'll be enormous numbers of people", "who will be saying I want to eat meat,", "but I want to check off the following boxes", "and for the first time in humanity", "we're gonna put there choices on the table", "and I'm not expecting to get there without", "some difficulty on the technical side", "or raising funds or even political side,", "but I think it's,", "when I started this company 3 1/2 years ago,", "it was science fiction, right,", "it was a question of if at that point,", "but now it's a question of when", "and I think getting to market,", "the first tasting is magical.", "If you are a meat eater,", "well calibrated meat eater for decades,", "the minute you taste the products we're making", "at Memphis Meats, you know it's meat.", "So just for the couple last minutes", "that we have remaining,", "if these things are all true,", "it scales, people want it,", "it becomes just as common,", "both the plant based proteins", "and the cultured proteins become common,", "when they scale what is to prevent", "the systems that support the manufacture of these products", "to become just as candidly pernicious", "as the systems that produce meat, now?", "The plant based proteins are gonna require", "much land replaced instead of the field corn", "that feeds the cattle,", "it'll need the pea and the soy some place.", "You're still, what you're describing in your clean facility", "that synthesizes the meat,", "what you're describing is a factory.", "In the end if you want to do at scale", "and both Impossible and Memphis have funding", "from folks who are investors in companies that,", "as we've been discussing today,", "have already done things to breach the public trust in ways.", "So how do we make sure that we don't replicate", "the problems of the 10,000 year-old system", "in the 21st century systems?", "With a lot of forethought and research", "that goes into producing and procurement", "and environmental impact, which we have a huge team", "at Impossible Foods that's looking at that", "and our sourcing is very thoughtful", "and looking towards the future in", "making sure that we're not gonna do more harm.", "And you're confident that there,", "I know you care about this in your restaurants too,", "this is something that you've been an advocate as well,", "so you're confident that that's something that", "folks at Impossible are thoughtful about.", "Absolutely, absolutely.", "And what changes as you scale?", "I think there's two things,", "on the first principle side,", "when we think about scaling production", "like we're talking about, we're talking about", "using 10 times less resources of land, water", "or any nutrients that we are to give to the animals", "and then green house gas.", "So I think the first principles are a lot more solid here", "than what we have for scaling commercial agriculture", "for 10 billion people.", "In China in 1960, per capita consumption of meat", "was 10 pounds, now 50 years later,", "per capita consumption is more than 100 pounds, right,", "and India has not even started, it's gonna get started", "so when we think about the first principle,", "10 X is really important on the second side,", "we are building companies in the era where", "there is a lot of dialogue between", "team members and the public", "and also the management team.", "Lot of transparency

"with us when we're building those things", "and our work force is predominately millennials", "and then the future will be gen Z's", "and they want a stake in this.", "So, I think we are more protected", "and completely guarantee it", "but I expect the meat factories,", "like you said that we are talking about", "if you're growing meat directly from animal cells", "we're gonna have it in small, medium, large sized", "urban centers or semi-urban centers,", "right close to where that population lives", "so transportation is less, the distribution is easier,", "it just simplifies", "so
