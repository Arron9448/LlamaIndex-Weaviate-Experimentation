Dale\u2019s aircraft was called a stealth fighter because it was \u201clow-observable,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it was invisible. It was black and flew at night, it was angular in shape to make radar waves bounce off in ways that are harder to detect, its jet engines were deep inside and their exhausts were shrouded to dissipate noise and heat. Its bombs were carried inside its fuselage to stop them from reflecting radar waves. Even the jet\u2019s black paint was specially mixed to absorb radar energy and reduce its on-screen signature. Hundreds of billions of dollars of cutting-edge science had gone into making sure that no stealth fighter had ever been shot down by an enemy.", "And yet at that moment, as he watched the missiles arc upwards, Dale realized that his jet was about to have the dubious distinction of being the first.", "The missiles weighed a ton each, were six meters long, with a bright orange flame spewing grey smoke, traveling at three times the speed of sound. The first one flew straight over the top of him, close enough that its shockwave buffeted his jet. He remembers being surprised that it didn\u2019t go off\u2014surface-to-air missiles like those are fitted with a proximity fuse that detonates their 60 kilogram explosive warhead when they get close to their targets, peppering them with small shards of metal shrapnel. He looked back, saw the next one and thought, It\u2019s going to run right into me.", "Courtesy of Countryman Press Buy This Book At: Amazon", "Bookshop.org", "Books-A-Million If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

As his aircraft dived out of his control, he needed to pull the ejection-seat handle that would rocket him out of it within the next couple of seconds, if he didn\u2019t want to spear into the ground at 500 mph.", "In life, we all have to deal with unexpected events. Not many of us will find ourselves fired out of a jet thousands of feet above the Earth, but in our professional and personal lives, it will often be how we respond to the unexpected that will most define us. However, perfectly understandably, most people spend very little time thinking about failure, disaster and worst-case scenarios. Indeed, the unexpected is by definition the thing you haven\u2019t planned for. We see this time and time again in the most extreme of circumstances. While we can\u2019t predict what events we\u2019ll find ourselves in\u2014be they natural disasters like earthquakes, or man-made catastrophes like violent attacks\u2014what we do know is that our human behavior in difficult situations tends to follow distinct patterns. These patterns always occur, and they have been observed in studies when random groups of people are subjected to the same stressors. Analyses of these studies reveal not only what proportion of us are likely to respond appropriately\u2014by which I mean doing something to aid survival\u2014during the heat of a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and therefore live to tell the tale, but also what the hazards or barriers are to \u2018coping\u2019 after the dust has settled.", "Roughly speaking, we all fall into one of three groups during a dynamic crisis event. A few people will know what to do (roughly one in 10), the vast majority of us will not know what to do\u2014we\u2019ll be stunned\u2014and a minority of people will react badly. Whether you\u2019re in the top, middle or bottom group, we are all liable to behave in those ways unless we retrain ourselves. But this retraining isn\u2019t the mammoth task you might think."], "authors": ["John Hudson", "John Hudso"], "keywords": ["prepare", "unexpected", "missiles", "ways", "jet", "survive", "stealth", "fail", "know", "going", "black", "force", "fighter", "radar"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
