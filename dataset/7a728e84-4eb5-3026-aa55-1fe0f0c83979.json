Advances in weatherproof textiles and apparel design mean that rain jackets today are more comfortable and watertight than ever. But depending on the climate and your level of activity, sorting through different styles, technologies, and waterproofing ratings can be confusing.", "To help, I tested more than 35 waterproof rain jackets through the long, wet Pacific Northwest winter. I hiked, biked, cycled, and walked my dog; I stood in the shower with my clothes on when the weather wasn't cooperating. I also got advice from Amber Williams, a consumer science educator and lecturer in textile science and pattern making at Utah State University\u2019s outdoor product design department. My conclusion: You don't really need to spend much more than $100 to stay dry. But if you spend hours in the rain every day like me, innovative new fabrics can immeasurably add to your comfort.", "Updated March 2021: We added new picks, like the Baxter Wood Trawler Jacket, and removed older ones.

Modern durable water repellents (DWRs) use PFCs in the manufacturing process, which then migrate from your clothing and into soil and streams as you tromp around outside.", "I'd argue that one of the best ways to avoid PFCs in an everyday jacket is to use a polyurethane jacket, or a classic rubber raincoat. Technical rain jacket manufacturers tend to shy away from polyurethane, because it feels, well, rubbery. But the material is durable, long-lasting, windproof, and waterproof, and it's also PFC-free!"], "authors": ["Adrienne So", "Adrienne S"], "keywords": ["pfcs", "best", "waterproof", "science", "stay", "wood", "rain", "spend", "jackets", "elements", "help", "brave", "jacket", "trawler", "rubber"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
