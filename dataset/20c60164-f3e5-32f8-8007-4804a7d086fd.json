William Barr, Trump\u2019s compliant Attorney General, got a jump on the process when he pre\u00ebmpted the public release of the report by providing a misleading summary, which minimized the special counsel\u2019s findings on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Trump compounded Barr\u2019s distortions by falsely and endlessly repeating that the report found \u201cno collusion, no obstruction.\u201d Congressional Democrats did little for the cause of clarity by using the report as an occasion to debate the semantics of what constitutes an impeachment investigation. And Robert Mueller himself invited a certain measure of confusion by telling his story in dense, legalistic prose. Barely six months after he delivered the report, it had already faded into the mists of Trumpiana: post-Sean Spicer, pre-whistle-blower.", "The whistle-blower revealed Trump\u2019s July 25th phone call to Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, in which, according to the official memorandum, Trump said that he wanted a \u201cfavor,\u201d then asked Zelensky to look into negative information concerning Joe Biden, at the time the Democratic front-runner for 2020. The request was so plainly an abuse of Presidential power\u2014Zelensky was awaiting delivery of military aid already approved by Congress\u2014that Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, launched an investigation focussed on impeachment, to be led by Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee. Mueller and Russia are out; Schiff and Ukraine are in.", "But the Russia and Ukraine scandals are, in fact, one story. Indeed, the President\u2019s false denials in both of them capture the common themes: soliciting help from foreign interests for partisan gain, followed by obstruction of efforts to uncover what happened. Both, too, share roots in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Mueller\u2019s two indictments of Russian interests\u2014the first involving the use of social media and the second the hacking of Democratic Party e-mails\u2014are perhaps the most detailed chronicle ever published of foreign interference in a U.S. political campaign. Trump\u2019s team was appreciative. When a public-relations adviser to a Russian oligarch\u2019s family e-mailed Donald Trump, Jr., offering dirt on Hillary Clinton that was \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\u201d the candidate\u2019s son gave a straightforward reply: \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d", "Just two years earlier, Putin had invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The government in Kiev went back and forth between leaders who wanted to accommodate Putin\u2019s regime and others who wanted to enlist the help of the West to push back against it. The political consultant of choice for the pro-Russian faction was Paul Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign chair in the summer of 2016. As Mueller documented, Manafort passed proprietary campaign polling data to pro-Russian Ukrainians. The campaign-era Trump portrayed in the report suffered from one major limitation: he wasn\u2019t President. He clearly welcomed Putin\u2019s assistance, and promised a better relationship with Russia, but he was still just a businessman from New York. The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint is the epilogue to Mueller\u2019s report: the coming of age of an aspiring colluder.", "It\u2019s important to note, as well, that, in the Ukrainian chapter, Trump has done Putin\u2019s bidding, to the extent that he can, going so far as to embrace a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 campaign. The rest of the U.S. government has never been as enamored of Putin as Trump is. That includes Republicans in Congress, who joined the Democrats in voting for military aid to Ukraine. Trump wants no part of conflict with Putin, but the aid package tied his hands. There was a revealing moment in his joint news conference with Zelensky at the United Nations last month. Almost as an aside, Trump said, \u201cI really believe that President Putin would like to do something. I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.\u201d Ukraine doesn\u2019t have a \u201cproblem\u201d with Putin\u2014it has an invasion by Putin.", "In the July 25th phone call, Trump did what he couldn\u2019t do as a candidate: he tried to leverage the power of the Presidency to extract partisan political advantage. Texts of U.S. officials, released last week, further suggest an attempted quid pro quo. On September 1st, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Kiev, asked, \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Gordon Sondland, a former Republican fund-raiser who is Trump\u2019s Ambassador to the European Union, replied, \u201cCall me.\u201d", "Mueller did chronicle Trump\u2019s efforts, as President, to interfere with his investigation. Trump made repeated attempts to rein in or fire Mueller, and was saved from that misconduct only by the refusal of people around him (including Don McGahn, his White House counsel; Rob Porter, his staff secretary; and even Corey Lewandowski, his otherwise zealous onetime campaign manager) to carry out his directives. The lesson of the past few weeks is that those restraining figures have left the building, literally and figuratively. Trump is currently surrounded by people like Barr and Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, who are willing to debase their offices to indulge Trump\u2019s abuse of power. The unhinged arias of Rudolph Giuliani, his personal lawyer, are a constant from the Russian chapter to the Ukrainian. In customary fashion, Trump has sought to normalize his corruption, by bragging that he could recruit even more countries, including China, to conduct political investigations for him. That\u2019s still an abuse of power, even though he\u2019s now doing it in public, rather than bothering to try to hide it.", "Mueller famously closed his investigation without rendering a judgment on whether the President committed crimes. \u201cWe did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct,\u201d he wrote. The time, though, for ultimate conclusions is approaching. One way of looking at Trump\u2019s evolution from candidate to President, from Mueller\u2019s time to Schiff\u2019s, is that his abuses are accelerating, with each unpunished act serving as a license for more. The Constitution gives Congress the tools to halt this cycle in Trump\u2019s out-of-control Presidency. The question now is whether the people\u2019s representatives will use them. \u2666"], "pubDate": null, "id": "20c60164-f3e5-32f8-8007-4804a7d086fd", "keywords": ["trumps", "president", "scandal", "russia", "ukraine", "mueller", "campaign", "trump", "report", "roots", "putin", "donald", "russian"], "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine Scandal Has Its Roots in Russia", "summary": "President Trump and his allies nearly succeeded in consigning the Mueller report to oblivion.\nMueller and Russia are out; Schiff and Ukraine are in.\nThe political consultant of choice for the pro-Russian faction was Paul Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign chair in the summer of 2016.\nAlmost as an aside, Trump said, \u201cI really believe that President Putin would like to do something.\nI really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.\u201d Ukraine doesn\u2019t have a \u201cproblem\u201d with Putin\u2014it has an invasion by Putin.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Toobin", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Jelani Cobb", "Susan B.
