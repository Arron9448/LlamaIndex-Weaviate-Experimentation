There\u2019s nothing quite like that feeling of anticipation when gliding alongside the promenade of a river port, snatching tantalising glimpses of what lies ashore, and Koblenz \u2013 beautifully located at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle Rivers \u2013 doesn\u2019t disappoint. The city is immersed in two millennia of history: founded by the Romans, it was successively occupied by the Franks, chosen as a residence of the German prince electors, conquered by the French and fortified by the Prussians! All have left their marks in the city\u2019s rich array of castles, churches and historic buildings. Koblenz is a romantic\u2019s dream \u2013 forest-covered hillsides dominate the skyline, while the lower slopes are strewn with pretty, half-timbered buildings so typical of the Rhineland. After a satisfying breakfast, we disembark to enjoy an insightful guided tour through \u2018Old Koblenz\u2019, a patchwork of narrow streets and squares, many lined with exquisitely restored traditional houses and cosy caf\u00e9s. There\u2019s time to explore on your own, maybe taking in a little shopping, before ambling back to the cruise ship. We continue upstream as we enjoy our first relaxing lunch on board and before long we arrive in Boppard, a gorgeous town on a dramatic, almost U-shaped river bend. Known as the \u2018Pearl of the Rhine\u2019, Boppard is renowned for its storybook medieval atmosphere of cobbled streets and ancient houses. Here we\u2019ll enjoy a guided tour lead by one of our local experts, with highlights including the beautiful white stone St. Severus and Carmelite churches, the marketplace with the ruins of the fortress and the old town with its charming winding alleys and half-timbered houses. The early evening is an ideal time to wander along the town\u2019s attractive riverside Rheinallee promenade before thoughts turn to tonight\u2019s menu, prepared by the ship\u2019s chef and served to your delight in the restaurant."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["enjoy", "ship", "strasbourg", "koblenz", "tour", "town", "streets", "ms", "river", "heidelberg", "houses", "theres", "rhine", "oscar", "wilde", "cruise"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
