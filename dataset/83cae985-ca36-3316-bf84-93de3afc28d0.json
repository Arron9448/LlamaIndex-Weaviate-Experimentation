But the first of their new media-oriented projects dropped earlier today in the form of a podcast on Spotify titled Archewell Audio. With the first episode serving as a reflection on the trials and tribulations of living through the pandemic, the couple invited an eclectic mix of voices to join them and express their experiences of an unprecedented year and their hopes for the future as 2021 draws ever closer. As Meghan explains at the beginning of the episode: \u201cWe thought, what if we could bring together some people that inspire us and people we admire, and get their thoughts on what they learned from 2020.\u201d", "Here, find the five things you need to know from Harry and Meghan\u2019s new podcast.", "It features a number of Harry and Meghan\u2019s high-profile friends", "It\u2019s been widely documented that Harry and Meghan\u2019s connections in Hollywood have been instrumental to pivoting into their new career in entertainment, with their move to California in the summer serving as the first step in the process. And many of these friends and acquaintances appear on the podcast to share their experiences of the past year, including filmmaker Tyler Perry, pop superstar Elton John, and tennis pro Naomi Osaka.", "It isn\u2019t just the starry line-up of figures from across the worlds of film, sport, and literature that impress, however, but also the number of important political voices they invited to share their visions for change in the world. There\u2019s an appearance from politician and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, who recounts a conversation with her 14-year-old niece about healing during a year marked by a pandemic and a new civil rights movement, as well as author and academic Rachel Cargle, whose charity The Loveland Foundation provides much-needed resources to support Black women and girls. It\u2019s a sign that Harry and Meghan won\u2019t be shying away from expressing their strongly-held beliefs in environmental causes, mental health advocacy, and racial equality as they enter this new chapter.", "It offers a rare insight into the couple\u2019s intimate rapport", "The podcast consists mostly of audio submitted by the participants they invited, with the couple choosing not to interview their subjects directly. Still, they offer an extended introduction, welcome each guest individually, and occasionally interject with anecdotes to flesh out the points they feel most important. It\u2019s these moments that provide a surprisingly intimate peek into the couple\u2019s relationship and rapport, with the ease of their back-and-forth patter obvious from the very beginning of the episode. Harry explains that they opted for audio to avoid \u201cnavigating the sometimes awkward dance of a video chat, meaning no one having to say, \u2018you\u2019re on mute\u2019 over and over again, which is probably one of the defining phrases of 2020.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so true,\u201d Meghan laughs in response."], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["invited", "meghan", "podcast", "voices", "episode", "number", "audio", "harrys", "markle", "share", "learned", "things", "meghans", "prince", "harry"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
