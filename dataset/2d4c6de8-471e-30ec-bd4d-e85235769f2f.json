Not only is this the day we're jumping back into Replay, but we're also doing it in a big way.

As if you even have to ask? Andrew Reiner and Marcus Stewart are joined by the one and only Dan Tack on the sticks as they kick off their adventure through Yharnam.", "We're kicking off the fun at 2 p.m. CT, so be sure to join us in the chat for the start of this amazing journey through one of the best Souls titles on the planet.
