He drove himself and his girlfriend, Fabiola Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, to congress for the inauguration in their second-hand Toyota. But citizens had conventional causes for trepidation, as well as something to celebrate. Mauricio Macri, the outgoing president, was the first non-Peronist since 1983 to end his term in office without tumult on the streets. But, as he handed the presidential seal and baton to Mr Fernand\u00e9z, there was nervousness about what the return of the Peronists will mean for a country in an economic crisis.", "Mr Macri leaves with Argentina in a deep recession. Two-fifths of its citizens are poor, meaning they cannot afford a basket of staple goods, and the share is rising. The annualised inflation rate exceeds 50%. Argentina\u2019s $57bn loan from the IMF is the largest bail-out in the fund\u2019s history. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has promised to put the economy \u201cback on its feet\u201d. But an adviser to the new president admits, \u201cThere are no easy answers on the economy, and no good options.\u201d", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s central problem is that Argentina lacks the money to deliver the relief he has promised. The country\u2019s net foreign-exchange reserves are just $12bn, about three months\u2019 worth of imports. The budget deficit is expected to exceed 4% of GDP this year; the government\u2019s overall debt stands at 93% of GDP. Capital flight, triggered by worries about Argentina\u2019s ability to pay its debt, has weakened the peso, the main reason inflation is so high.", "Mr Macri had hoped that the IMF\u2019s money plus an ambitious programme of budgetary austerity would restore the markets\u2019 confidence. Instead, austerity further weakened the economy, driving voters to Mr Fern\u00e1ndez. That spooked the financial markets, which feared that he would bring back the economic populism of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (no relation), who preceded Mr Macri as president and will now become Argentina\u2019s vice-president. The peso tumbled more, pushing inflation still higher.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez wants to reverse the sequence that Mr Macri had in mind: he is betting that growth will lead to a revival of confidence rather than the other way around. To bring that about, he has assembled a team of economists with heterodox ideas, some of them veterans of Ms Fernandez\u2019s disastrous presidency. But he has been vague about his plans, and that has added to the markets\u2019 unease.", "The centrepiece of the economic programme is likely to be a restructuring of Argentina\u2019s $123bn debt to domestic and foreign private creditors (excluding the IMF), to be carried out by the new economy minister, Mart\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n. An academic with little political experience who specialises in debt negotiation, he has spent the past decade in the United States and is close to Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prizewinning economist who often denounces global capital markets and the IMF.", "Mr Guzm\u00e1n has told his new cabinet colleagues that Argentina faces \u201csocial disaster\u201d if it pays the enormous sum (over $50bn) of debt due in 2020. He has proposed that Argentina defer payment of both interest and principal for the next two years to give the government the means to kickstart the economy. Analysts assume he will end up demanding bigger concessions than that. The president-elect himself has warned that the risk of default is high. Bond prices suggest the markets are expecting a haircut\u2014a discount on the securities\u2019 face value\u2014of nearly 50%.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez would buttress a debt restructuring with other growth-boosting measures. He wants to raise public- and private-sector wages and pensions, and plans to keep a cap on utility prices that was due to expire at the end of 2019. Mat\u00edas Kulfas, a central-bank official during Ms Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s presidency, has been put in charge of a \u201cministry of productive development\u201d, which will be responsible for production, trade, energy and mining. He has a target of doubling exports during the four-year life of the government.", "The new government is expected to keep capital controls introduced by Mr Macri as an emergency measure to curb the depreciation of the peso and curb inflation, and to reach a pact with employers and trade unions to hold down prices and wages. That may mean that salaries will rise by less than Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has implied.", "The biggest question is how quickly the new team plans to cut inflation and generate the primary fiscal surplus, ie, before debt-service payments, needed to repay what remains of Argentina\u2019s debts, including to the IMF. Although Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has downplayed the need for a primary surplus, the new economy minister has suggested that Argentina should aim to achieve one gradually. There is worried speculation that the central bank will pay for expensive promises such as boosting pensions by printing money, even though its new president, Miguen Pesce, is thought to be a safe choice. That would push inflation still higher.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has tried to dispel the impression that his team will repeat the mistakes made by Ms Fern\u00e1ndez, who fought with foreign creditors, presided over an excessive expansion of the public-sector payroll, raised trade barriers and levied punishing taxes on exporters. \u201cThis is Alberto\u2019s economic team, and he will be in charge on this front,\u201d says an adviser to the new president.", "Yet Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has not laid to rest fears that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez will have undue influence over his government. Mr Guzm\u00e1n got the economy ministry only after she had vetoed two other candidates, says the adviser. Outside the economic sphere, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez has acquired unprecedented clout for a vice-president. Her influence suggests that reforming the state and combating corruption will not be priorities for the new administration.", "Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had a hand in the choice of the ministers of interior, defence and security. Her supporters will be in charge of the agencies that handle taxation, pensions and care of old people, all of which have big budgets and jobs to offer political allies. As vice-president, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez is the senate\u2019s leader and commands the Peronist bloc in the chamber, where it has a majority. Her son, M\u00e1ximo, leads the Peronists in the lower house of congress.", "Ms Fern\u00e1ndez also helped arrange the appointment of Carlos Zannini, one of her closest associates, to be attorney-general. Mr Zannini was held in preventive detention for his alleged role in covering up a deal that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had made with Iran to absolve it of blame for the bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 in which 86 people, including the bomber, died. His trial has been delayed indefinitely. Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor who was murdered in 2015, had indicted Mr Zannini. A judge added a further charge of treason. As attorney-general Mr Zannini, who was released from jail in 2018 and denies all charges, will lead the government\u2019s anti-corruption unit as well as its team of lawyers.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has already signalled that he is not concerned about the alleged misdeeds of his senior officials. He contends that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez and jailed members of her government are victims of \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d. He has pronounced Mr Zannini innocent. \u201cWe vindicate you,\u201d he told the new attorney-general.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez will also revive aspects of his Peronist predecessor\u2019s foreign policy. The incoming foreign minister, Felipe Sol\u00e1, has signalled \u201cre-engagement\u201d with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s leftist dictator, who will now be less of a regional pariah. Argentina\u2019s new government will not accept in its current form a trade deal negotiated by Mercosur, a four-country trade bloc, with the European Union. This will dampen Argentina\u2019s growth prospects in the long run and increase tension with Brazil, the bloc\u2019s biggest member. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez and Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, speak of having \u201cpragmatic relations\u201d. But there is no hiding the frostiness. Mr Bolsonaro did not attend Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s inauguration, sending his vice-president instead.", "The Macri government is proud of having ended the economic isolation that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez imposed on Argentina. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent four years taking Argentina out of the deep freeze,\u201d says Jorge Faurie, the outgoing foreign minister. \u201cThe fear is we\u2019re going back.\u201d Optimists think that the leftward shift in diplomacy will make it easier for Mr Fern\u00e1ndez to adopt a moderate economic policy. Argentines must hope he is right."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s new president, faces economic crisis", "pubDate": null, "summary": "ALBERTO FERNAND\u00c9Z began his term as Argentina\u2019s president on December 10th in unorthodox fashion.\nYet Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has not laid to rest fears that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez will have undue influence over his government.\nAs vice-president, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez is the senate\u2019s leader and commands the Peronist bloc in the chamber, where it has a majority.\nMs Fern\u00e1ndez also helped arrange the appointment of Carlos Zannini, one of her closest associates, to be attorney-general.\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez has already signalled that he is not concerned about the alleged misdeeds of his senior officials.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/12/10/alberto-fernandez-argentinas-new-president-faces-economic-crisis"}
