Johnson quoted Fiona Hill, a former national-security official who, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, had described a \u201cblowup\u201d she had had with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, with regard to Ukraine. After hearing Sondland\u2019s own testimony to the committee, Hill said, she\u2019d had an epiphany about the source of their conflict: though she\u2019d believed that they were both engaged in the grand mission of foreign policy, the President had actually dispatched Sondland on \u201ca domestic political errand.\u201d", "That errand, Johnson said, was to make Ukrainian officials \u201can offer they could not refuse.\u201d In the words of the first of two articles of impeachment that the Judiciary Committee\u2019s clerk read on Thursday morning, at the start of a tense and long debate, Donald Trump \u201ccorruptly solicited\u201d the Ukrainians, attempting to trade military aid and a White House meeting for two investigations. One involved a specific conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election; the other concerned Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump wanted Ukraine \u201cto target an American citizen,\u201d Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, said. Democrats have described this scheme, with some justice, as extortion or bribery, but the charge in the first article is abuse of power.", "The Republicans on the committee used the debate to try to peddle a different story. \u201cShow me the Ukrainian that was pressured!\u201d Matt Gaetz, of Florida, said, although multiple witnesses had already testified that a number of Ukrainians were. Ken Buck, of Colorado, brought up the money that Hunter Biden received as a member of the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, and argued that Trump was within his rights to ask for an investigation: \u201cThis isn\u2019t smearing. This is seeking the truth about corruption.\u201d (Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, argued that Trump\u2019s truth-seeking impulse arose only after Joe Biden declared his Presidential candidacy.) And Jim Jordan, of Ohio, offered his theory on what the meaning of \u201cus\u201d was when Trump, in the now infamous July 25th phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.\u201d This \u201cus\u201d was not \u201cthe royal we,\u201d reflecting a request for a personal favor, Jordan said, but an example of Trump\u2019s \u201cworking on behalf of the American people.\u201d In case that didn\u2019t clear things up, Jordan had a simpler explanation for why anyone would want to impeach Trump. \u201cThey don\u2019t like us,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us common folk in Ohio, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Texas.\u201d Republican after Republican goaded the Democrats with the notion that they were just scared that Trump would win again.", "The focus of the first article of impeachment is, of course, what Trump has already done to try to secure that victory\u2014namely, enlist foreign officials in his re\u00eblection campaign. His demand for the Ukrainian investigations, according to the charge, was not a backward-looking effort to get to the bottom of a corruption case but an attempt to anticipate and influence the 2020 election. That prospective threat is one reason the Democrats have given for moving the articles of impeachment along with great speed. They do not pretend that they have collected all the available evidence. For that shortfall, they have blamed what Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, described as Trump\u2019s \u201cblockading and intimidating.\u201d At the President\u2019s direction, witnesses under subpoena have failed to appear, and the Administration has refused to turn over documents. (During the debate, Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, offered the weak riposte that no \u201cretribution\u201d had been inflicted on the witnesses who did testify.) There are court fights under way now over the subpoenas, but the Democrats, rather than wait, made the President\u2019s defiance the subject of the second article of impeachment: obstruction of Congress.", "\u201cThe President is the smoking gun,\u201d Pramila Jayapal, of Washington, said, adding, with a slightly too picturesque extension of the metaphor, \u201cThe smoking gun is already reloaded. And whether or not it gets fired\u2014that\u2019s up to us.\u201d At a press conference on Tuesday, during which Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi introduced the two articles, Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said that to ask \u201cWhy not wait?\u201d is the equivalent of asking \u201cWhy not let him cheat just one more time?\u201d That may be a resounding appeal, but on its own terms it doesn\u2019t make much sense. The rushed timeline almost certainly means that impeachment is hurtling toward an acquittal for the President in the Republican-controlled Senate by February, with nine months left before the election. A longer investigation might have been a better way to monitor and restrain Trump; it\u2019s worth remembering that his call to Zelensky came the day after the testimony of the special counsel Robert Mueller in the House, which, he felt, had lifted a \u201cphony cloud\u201d from over his head.", "This schedule may help get moderate congressional Democrats re\u00eblected and the Democratic senators who are running for President back out on the campaign trail (and get Hunter Biden out of the spotlight). But, adding to the sense of missed opportunities, the articles largely bypass other issues that have been raised about Trump, such as violations of the emoluments clause and matters covered in the Mueller report\u2014notably, a long list of possible examples of obstruction of justice.", "The hearings in the Judiciary Committee provided a sad confirmation of the likelihood of the President\u2019s acquittal. \u201cDo we have abuse of power? Yes: Adam Schiff!\u201d Guy Reschenthaler, Republican of Pennsylvania, shouted. He added that the committee had voted down his attempt to subpoena the whistle-blower: \u201cThat is obstruction of Congress!\u201d (By way of compensation, Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, recited a list of names that included a person suspected of being the whistle-blower.) In the coming trial, the tone of the Republican senators may be more restrained, but it is unlikely to be more edifying.", "Val Demings, of Florida, was one of several Democrats who spoke of the historic weight of the moment, and to an extent she was right: Trump will always be a President who was impeached, and the two articles describing his offenses will be scrutinized in textbooks. But domestic politics impose their own burden. Not one of the House Republicans is expected to vote yes on either article. They know their President, and they know their errand. \u2666"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/trumps-impeachment-timeline-and-the-2020-election", "id": "f8519371-88b3-3100-ac45-85582ed18423", "title": "Trump\u2019s Impeachment Timeline and the 2020 Election", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "One involved a specific conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election; the other concerned Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\nDemocrats have described this scheme, with some justice, as extortion or bribery, but the charge in the first article is abuse of power.\nThis is seeking the truth about corruption.\u201d (Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, argued that Trump\u2019s truth-seeking impulse arose only after Joe Biden declared his Presidential candidacy.)\nThat prospective threat is one reason the Democrats have given for moving the articles of impeachment along with great speed.\nThe rushed timeline almost certainly means that impeachment is hurtling toward an acquittal for the President in the Republican-controlled Senate by February, with nine months left before the election.", "pubDate": null}
