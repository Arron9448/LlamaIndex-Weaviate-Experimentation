{"pubDate": null, "title": "The Norwegian Novel That Divided a Family and Captivated a Country", "paragraphs": ["Remember how divisive reality television was, before it became just television? In Norway, an intense debate is taking place about virkelighetslitteratur, or \u201creality literature,\u201d a putatively fictional strain of writing that draws on identifiable characters and events. Critics of reality television complained that it was overproduced; the argument against reality literature is that it is insufficiently artificial, exposing and misrepresenting people who never consented to be a part of it. The country\u2019s most flagrant transgressor of the code of plausible disclaimability is Vigdis Hjorth, whose prickly, persuasive novel \u201cWill and Testament\u201d came out in Norway in 2016, and has just been published in English, by Verso. Earlier this month, the translation, by Charlotte Barslund, was long-listed for the National Book Award for Translated Literature. \u201cWill and Testament\u201d was a sensation in Norway, a best-seller and the winner of the Norwegian Critics Prize. Already one of Norway\u2019s pre\u00ebminent authors, Hjorth, who has written more than twenty novels, became a media fixation, having marshalled her prodigious gifts to suggest\u2014or to lead people to believe that she had suggested\u2014that her father had raped her when she was five years old. Hjorth\u2019s narrator\u2019s name is Bergljot, not Vigdis, and although she matches up with the author in conspicuous ways, Hjorth has said that the novel is not autobiographical. Still, she has become the biggest Scandinavian literary story of the past twenty years, except for maybe Karl Ove Knausgaard, with whose work hers has been compared, sometimes superficially. Like Knausgaard, Hjorth is writing against repression, against the taboo on telling things as they really are. But he urges us to look at dead bodies; she forces us to regard bleeding souls. Bergljot\u2019s trauma lives as a secret that she keeps from herself. She grows up, marries a \u201cnice, decent man,\u201d produces three children, and plugs away at a dissertation on modern German drama while trying to write a one-act play. Eventually, she leaves her husband; her parents aren\u2019t thrilled, but they chip in to keep her afloat. When Bergljot\u2019s father helps renovate her bathroom, she worries about him having a key to her new house, but she doesn\u2019t dare ask Dad\u2014that\u2019s what she calls him\u2014to give it back. The reader isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s stopping her, and Bergljot probably isn\u2019t, either. She exists in a vague state, batting away doubt and fear like pop-up ads from her psyche. Then, one Sunday morning, her pain hits its target. She can\u2019t move, talk, stand. She suffers several more attacks before discovering their source: \u201cI went to the Mac and read my text, and there it was, in between all the other words, and I had a shock, I was floored, and at one fell swoop I turned into someone else, forever changed into another by this moment of truth.\u201d It isn\u2019t until much later in the book that Bergljot reveals what, exactly, those words are: \u201cHe touched me like a doctor, he touched me like a father.\u201d She has effectively written a diary that she never meant to read. The main action of \u201cWill and Testament\u201d takes place decades after this episode. Now a drama critic, Bergljot has broken with her parents, who have \u201centered into a conspiracy to save their reputation,\u201d and with her two younger sisters, Astrid and \u00c5sa, who believe that her memories of abuse have been cooked up in psychoanalysis. Within the clan, Bergljot has undergone a sort of downward mobility, becoming \u201can outcast who threatened the family honour.\u201d An older brother, B\u00e5rd, has also absented himself from the scene, citing paternal neglect. The siblings bring to mind a broken chain of paper dolls, one pair displayed on the refrigerator door and the other stuffed in the back of a drawer. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know your parents had two other children, you\u2019d think it was a normal happy family,\u201d Bergljot\u2019s grown son remarks, after an evening at his grandparents\u2019 house. (They are the kind of people who throw birthday parties for adults.) Monstrous men don\u2019t create art as often as they do fractured families. The filial conflict flares up again when Bergljot\u2019s father announces his intention to split his estate equally among his four children, with the exception of two cherished vacation cabins, which will go to the favored sisters. B\u00e5rd and Bergljot raise hell\u2014knowing they are being bought off, they refuse to offer themselves on the cheap. Then Dad dies, leaving no clear heir to the most valuable asset of all: control of the family story.", "For years, the family has functioned as a closed circuit. Bergljot would fire off an accusation, and it would bounce from relative to relative, then return to her in unchanged form. There was nowhere for it to go, no way to alter its energy. The book\u2019s claustrophobic atmosphere is exacerbated by the use of letters, e-mails, and text messages\u2014sometimes directly quoted, sometimes paraphrased, occasionally mediated beyond all sense. In sharing them, Bergljot is doing the same thing we\u2019re doing when we send a friend a screenshot: trying to break open a drama by drawing a new person into it. \u201cWill and Testament\u201d is a gut-wrenching novel, but it is also a gossipy one, which begs to be read in an old-fashioned, judgmental manner. Right and wrong, good and bad, are applicable modes of assessment here. The reader, furnished with primary documents, has the opportunity to take a side. In fact, to be a moral person in the zero-sum world of this novel, she must. Throughout \u201cWill and Testament,\u201d the plot is interrupted by short, cerebral chapters in which Bergljot meditates on life in the abstract, as opposed to reality in its particulars. She quotes the philosopher Arne Johan Vetlesen\u2019s work on truth-and-reconciliation processes and ruminates on the Balkan crisis\u2014cases through which she is seeking truth, her own alongside the universal. Bergljot\u2019s friends are studies in solidarity, too. They serve as a gallery of character witnesses, attesting to her ability to maintain long-term bonds of love. She cleaves so quickly and so closely to one equally troubled acquaintance, Klara, that the reader\u2019s disastrous-friend antennae bristle in anticipation. Klara, seemingly a classic pot-stirrer, insists that Bergljot stop seeing her family. Yet Klara turns out to be a canny, patient tactician for her friend\u2019s best interests. After Bergljot\u2019s father\u2019s death, she counsels, \u201cNow it\u2019s three against two and that\u2019s new, they weren\u2019t prepared for that but they\u2019re still the majority, and they have each other.\u201d Whether Klara is in affirming mode or egging-on mode, her most important attribute is that she is steadfast in her allegiance to Bergljot, adding one more number to her side of the field. Bergljot is settling scores with herself as much as with anybody else. She is striving, in the Kierkegaardian tradition, to create a majority of one. It\u2019s a solitary quest of detours and traps, including the fear that, as both narrator and character, she has somehow got the story all wrong. An inveterate phone-talker, Bergljot tells her tale as one would in conversations with a friend, doubling back on earlier versions as though to retrieve some crucial detail that might prove her claim once and for all, vacillating among indignation and dark humor and self-doubt. These stops and starts illustrate the painful circularity of Bergljot\u2019s problem: people don\u2019t believe her because she\u2019s a basket case, but she\u2019s a basket case because people don\u2019t believe her. Bergljot\u2019s story can get blurry. Sometimes it\u2019s been twenty years since she cut off contact with her family; other times it\u2019s fifteen, and she still interacts with them sporadically. She doesn\u2019t try to pave over the holes in her testimony, instead allowing them to exist as natural features of a turbulent emotional landscape. Nor does she tamp down her reactions. There is a certain audacity in saying, \u201cI heard the email notification from my iPhone on the seat next to me, an act of war, was my guess,\u201d and asking people to take you seriously. Many readers, repelled by Bergljot\u2019s grandiosity, won\u2019t. But, in my eyes, Bergljot saves herself from melodrama by being honest about her tendency toward it. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m, like, whoa, I have superpowers. Why am I wasting my time at the gym?\u201d Cartoon by Pat Byrnes Hjorth is fearless on the complicated bonds between survivors and abusers, who hold power over them in the form of answers. Bergljot says, astonishingly, that as a young mother \u201cI still had a small amount of contact with my family for the sake of my children.\u201d Years later, it doesn\u2019t seem to occur to her that she doesn\u2019t have to go to her father\u2019s funeral. An abusive parent is the alpha, the omega, and the person who teaches you the alphabet. When Bergljot re\u00ebnters the fray, she does so in a headlong way that hardly protects her vulnerabilities. At the outset of the inheritance dispute, she gets up the nerve to e-mail Astrid, an expert in human-rights law and thereby \u201ca kind of officially good person,\u201d about the cabins. Astrid responds with a litany of dispassionate facts. Bergljot says, \u201cI felt that I was threatening her with an axe, she reacted as though I was waving a plastic knife in the air.\u201d Hjorth seems to be suggesting that rectitude can be the enemy of justice, and that neutrality can be a form of self-dealing. Proudly objective parties can\u2019t satisfyingly adjudicate the most violent disputes, because they have a bias against the emotional effects of conflict. The book\u2019s turning point occurs when Bergljot, desperate to jolt her relatives out of their complacency, decides to read aloud her accusations at a meeting with the entire family, in the presence of their accountant. After so much mediated confrontation, she has to work herself up to this act of exposure (\u201cJust see it through, because it\u2019s absolutely crucial, this is about your life,\u201d she tells herself), but she barely makes it through a paragraph before the family revolts. \u201cNow is not the time or the place,\u201d Astrid chides, deleting Bergljot\u2019s speech as though it were one of her late-night e-mails. Later, Bergljot launches into a self-examination: After my bombshell twenty-three years ago, I chose to withdraw, to heal myself, to seek professional help. Should I have called Astrid with the physical details, pleaded my case with a skeptical sister who loved her parents and had every reason to, who had a great relationship with her parents, who wanted a happy family, should I have called her and shared my open wounds, exposed my nakedness, so painful, so shameful, so intimate, so difficult to talk about outside the psychoanalyst\u2019s consulting room, tell her things I hadn\u2019t told anyone other than my psychoanalyst, not even my friends, my boyfriends or my children because it hurt too much and was too physically intrusive, because I didn\u2019t want my nearest and dearest to have such images of me in their heads? One senses that these are not rhetorical questions. Bergljot is trying to calculate the acceptable ratio of disclosure to damage."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/07/the-norwegian-novel-that-divided-a-family-and-captivated-a-country", "keywords": ["hjorth", "parents", "read", "family", "bergljots", "divided", "reality", "novel", "astrid", "norwegian", "captivated", "testament", "children", "bergljot", "country"], "summary": "\u201cWill and Testament\u201d was a sensation in Norway, a best-seller and the winner of the Norwegian Critics Prize.\nHjorth\u2019s narrator\u2019s name is Bergljot, not Vigdis, and although she matches up with the author in conspicuous ways, Hjorth has said that the novel is not autobiographical.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know your parents had two other children, you\u2019d think it was a normal happy family,\u201d Bergljot\u2019s grown son remarks, after an evening at his grandparents\u2019 house.\nThen Dad dies, leaving no clear heir to the most valuable asset of all: control of the family story.\n\u201cNow is not the time or the place,\u201d Astrid chides, deleting Bergljot\u2019s speech as though it were one of her late-night e-mails.", "authors": ["Lauren Collins", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "James Wood", "Alexandra Schwartz"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "6e9fc7b3-37a8-37d1-bbdd-17a1e7e06210"}
