The company, they say, has avoided making the proposed changes because a brewing power struggle between Mr. Murray and the new publisher, Almar Latour, has contributed to a stalemate that threatens the future of The Journal.", "Mr. Murray and Mr. Latour, 50, represent two extremes of the model Murdoch employee. Mr. Murray is the tactful editor; Mr. Latour is the brash entrepreneur. The two rose within the organization at roughly the same time. When the moment came to replace Gerry Baker as the top editor in 2018, both were seen as contenders.", "The two men have never gotten along, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Or as an executive who knows both well put it, \u201cThey hate each other.\u201d The digital strategy report has only heightened the strain in their relationship \u2014 and, with it, the direction of the crown jewel in the Murdoch news empire.", "Their longstanding professional rivalry comes down to both personality and approach. Mr. Murray is more deliberative, while Mr. Latour is quick to act. But the core of their friction is still a mystery, according to people familiar with them.", "Dow Jones, in a statement, disputed that characterization, saying there was no friction between the editor and publisher. It also cited \u201crecord profits and record subscriptions,\u201d which it attributed to \u201cthe wisdom of its current strategy.\u201d Both Mr. Murray and Mr. Latour declined to be interviewed for this article.", "About a month after the report was submitted, Ms. Story\u2019s strategy team was concerned that its work might never see the light of day, three people with knowledge of the matter said, and a draft was leaked to one of The Journal\u2019s own media reporters, Jeffrey Trachtenberg. He filed a detailed article on it late last summer.", "But the first glimpse that outside readers, and most of the staff, got of the document wasn\u2019t in The Journal. In October, a pared-down version of The Content Review was leaked to BuzzFeed News, which included a link to the document as a sideways scan. (Staffers, eager to read the report, had to turn their heads 90 degrees.)"], "authors": ["Edmund Lee"], "keywords": ["staff", "journal", "inside", "street", "future", "fight", "murray", "according", "mr", "latour", "editor", "work", "wall", "review", "strategy", "report"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
