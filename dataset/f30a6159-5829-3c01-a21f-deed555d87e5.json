At home in the English countryside, for instance, he insouciantly transformed his bathroom with a fresco of figures after Michelangelo: He now describes it as \u201cThe Sistine Bathroom.\u201d He created a collection of obelisk table ornaments that appear\u2014thanks to his alchemical paintbrush\u2014to have been assembled from shards of lapis, porphyry, or malachite. He\u2019s made a group of vibrantly colored resin sculptures and a series of chiaroscuro trompe l\u2019oeil panel paintings\u2014all while assiduously keeping up a lively design-centric Instagram account (@ashleyhicks1970) and a series of virtual tours of storied houses on Instagram Live. And when his collaborator Martina Mondadori relocated from a London town house to an apartment in her hometown of Milan last year, it provided not only a new canvas for her and the aesthetic that she has defined in the pages of her cult magazine, Cabana, but a further opportunity for Hicks to brandish his painter\u2019s easel.", "Mondadori founded the biannual design publication in 2014 (with friends Christoph Radl and Gianluca Reina) to showcase a selection of atmospheric and layered environments that made patina glamorous\u2014she describes their unifying spirit as gem\u00fctlich, warm and inviting\u2014and to celebrate the revival of craft around the world. The magazine proved so potent that it became a noun (as in \u201cthat lampshade fringe is so Cabana\u201d) and swiftly engendered a tribe of devoted contributors and acolytes\u2014and an enticing product range. Hicks soon became a contributor, turning his lens and pen on such subjects as the fabled frescoes of the Villa Imperiale in Pesaro.", "Hicks adorned the walls with a trompe l\u2019oeil mural after Piranesi\u2019s 1777 studies of the Paestum ruins.

Photographed by Guido Taroni, Vogue, April 2021", "Hicks\u2019s passion for photography resulted in the handsome 2018 volume Buckingham Palace: The Interiors, for which he documented not only the storied royal residence\u2019s staterooms but remarkable private areas as well\u2014familiar only to members of the royal family, their staff, and their guests. (Hicks himself is a cousin of HRH Prince Philip.) He followed this up with 2019\u2019s Rooms With a History: Interiors and their Inspirations, a book that is \u201cfull,\u201d as he has written, \u201cof deeply pretentious opinions on everything from ugly colors (do they exist?) to flowers (I love them, who doesn\u2019t?)\u201d", "Meanwhile, working together on projects at Cabana, Hicks and Mondadori realized that their rapport extended beyond a shared aesthetic\u2014and a deeper relationship bloomed. \u201cWe complement each other,\u201d says Hicks, \u201cand compliment each other, so it all works quite well.\u201d", "For both, design is in their blood. Mondadori, scion of the publishing house of Mondadori and the Zanussi home-appliance company on her mother\u2019s side, grew up in a wildly atmospheric Milanese apartment that was decorated by family friend Renzo Mongiardino, Italy\u2019s genius of interior design. Mongiardino layered the rooms with Indian and Persian textiles, shamelessly posthumous \u201cOld Master\u201d works, and extraordinarily convincing trompe l\u2019oeil, suggesting by turns maple-wood marquetry or marble panels. As a child, Mondadori craved \u201ca minimalist white house,\u201d she says, but now she gleefully embraces the maximalist Mongiardino aesthetic: \u201cI can\u2019t live without color.\u201d"], "authors": ["Hamish Bowles", "Hamish Bowle"], "keywords": ["came", "mongiardino", "works", "house", "hicks", "loeil", "design", "storied", "martina", "milan", "life", "trompe", "cabana", "founder", "lockdown", "mondadori"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
