They still train constantly and tell me that their favorite downtime watch is old boxing matches on YouTube and that their morning routine consists of a cup of matcha, reading the news, and 100 push-ups. \u201cAll your shit comes up,\u201d they say of boxing. \u201cIf you rage when you are confronted, it comes up. If you shut down, it comes up. If you weep, it comes up. And so boxing is all about control. It is all about control, strategy, and adaptiveness.\u201d", "When Khan was a teenager, they were placed in group homes, sometimes sleeping outside. \u201cSomething happened to me when I was around 16 and on a park bench much like this one,\u201d they say. \u201cI was hungry, and I had been on that park bench maybe seven nights in a row. And I just thought, If I died right now, no one would even notice.\u201d", "This was not a far-fetched idea for a poor, Black, nonbinary kid in Toronto. A year or so earlier Khan had been stopped by police and carded, the Canadian law-enforcement practice of asking for ID and questioning citizens at random. Studies have shown that Black Canadians are carded at a rate substantially higher than their white counterparts. But Khan hadn\u2019t just been carded, they were strip-searched.", "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know that I could say no,\u201d they recall quietly. \u201cThey were the first people I was ever fully naked in front of, outside of my parents as a child\u2026. And they made jokes about my body, made jokes about me\u2026and I was humiliated in a way that I just didn\u2019t know I could feel.\u201d", "With that in mind, Khan says, they fully accepted the idea that no one was coming to help them. \u201cAnd the only way I could live is if I fought to.\u201d", "MOST PEOPLE know Janaya Future Khan as a fighter. Their prominence in the Black Lives Matter movement can be dated to 2014, when they helped organize an action outside Toronto\u2019s U.S. Consulate after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, and the much less publicized police killing of 33-year-old Jermaine Carby, during a traffic stop in Brampton, Ontario. Thousands of people showed up to the Toronto action. Ontario legislative assemblyman Michael Coteau was serving in the Provincial Parliament at the time and feels that protest permanently shifted the government\u2019s approach to racial equity. (Ontario has since established an Anti-Racism Directorate.) \u201cI have a lot of respect for those young people who were not given a lot of respect at the time,\u201d Coteau told me. \u201cThey went through intense pressure...they were on those steps for weeks, in the cold, and no one would talk to them. [But] they were strong, brave, and I think really thoughtful on how they brought this message to the people, and if it wasn\u2019t for them I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be in this environment today.\u201d"], "authors": ["Carvell Wallace", "Carvell Wallac"], "keywords": ["lives", "black", "toronto", "comes", "inside", "future", "boxing", "protest", "meets", "say", "outside", "khan", "ontario", "matters", "know", "carded", "spirituality", "janaya"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
