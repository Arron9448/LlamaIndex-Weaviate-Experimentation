He first put a Bernie Sanders portrait on his desk, two former colleagues said. Then, he moved on to wearing MAGA hats around the office, which raised eyebrows among his more progressive, if fairly apolitical, co-workers, though that was when some people still imagined the far right could be \u201cironic.\u201d", "When he left BuzzFeed later that year to work as the \u201ctour manager\u201d for Milo Yiannopoulos, a darling of the racist and anti-Semitic \u201calt-right,\u201d colleagues were momentarily shocked. Then, they scrolled through Mr. Gionet\u2019s Twitter account, where his increasingly vile statements were getting him retweets from far-right figures, and realized that they shouldn\u2019t have been.", "Still, it\u2019s not clear what Mr. Gionet actually believes, if anything. And really, I\u2019m not sure I care.", "This isn\u2019t a sympathetic profile of a young man gone wrong. I can\u2019t muster much pity for a guy who, before he was attacking his Capitol, spent his time shooting some kind of bottled irritant (he called it \u201ccontent spray\u201d) into the eyes of innocent people for YouTube views and shouting at store clerks who asked him to wear a mask.", "To me, this story is about something different, a sort of social media power that we helped sharpen at BuzzFeed that can exert an almost irresistible gravitational pull.", "If you haven\u2019t had the experience of posting something on social media that goes truly viral, you may not understand its profound emotional attraction. You\u2019re suddenly the center of a digital universe, getting more attention from more people than you ever have. The rush of affirmation can be giddy, and addictive. And if you have little else to hold on to, you can lose yourself to it.", "Even as we sought to make our work spread at BuzzFeed, we faced constraints \u2014 by truth in our news division, by hewing to a broadly positive set of values on our entertainment side. But Mr. Gionet ultimately broke loose of those boundaries, seeming to follow the signals he found on social media without any scruple. The only through line was his desire to build an audience. He was boosting Bernie Sanders before he was chanting anti-Semitic slogans in Charlottesville, Va., then temporarily recanting those extreme views and later committing violent crimes to get views on YouTube. He built an audience among coronavirus deniers and then, when he apparently contracted the disease, posted the screenshot of his own positive test to Instagram with a tearful emoji. A few weeks later, he joined the pro-Trump uprising in the Capitol."], "authors": ["Ben Smith"], "keywords": ["internet", "youtube", "work", "worked", "capitol", "stormed", "week", "views", "later", "sanders", "social", "positive", "buzzfeed", "media", "mr"], "pubDate": "2021-01-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
