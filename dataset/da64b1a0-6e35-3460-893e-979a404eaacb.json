But far more likely, in the first half of 2020, your company had to quickly and unexpectedly pivot from a traditional office environment to a mostly or fully remote workplace, in which teams are distributed across geographies and possibly even time zones.", "Whether you manage a remote team on purpose or due to the pandemic, you have likely noticed that remote work comes with a unique set of challenges, frictions and miscommunications that arise when face-to-face communication isn't regularly an option.", "To better understand these challenges and what managers can do to mitigate them, we spoke to Sacha Connor, who founded the consultancy Virtual Work Insider and teaches executive education courses at Lehigh University, and Liam Martin, co-founder of remote-work service providers Staff.com and Time Doctor, and co-organiser of the world's largest conference on building and scaling remote teams, Running Remote.", "These two remote-work experts shared five of their top tips for easing friction in partly and fully remote organisations.", "1. Be alert to unconscious biases", "Connor explains that in fully remote organisations, the unconscious bias to look out for is recency bias: the tendency to place more importance on things seen more recently. Some employees are better than others at overcoming this bias and keeping themselves top-of-mind. As a manager, you have to think continually about the whole ecosystem of your team. In hybrid structures, managers can be susceptible to distance bias, causing those working remotely to feel they are \u201cout of sight, out of mind.\u201d Connor suggests, \u201cAs a manager, try to ensure that everyone, regardless of location or time zone, has a sense of belonging and is receiving the necessary information. And when choosing who gets a new role or project, be sure to tap into the full pool of talents and perspectives your organisation may need, no matter where or when they are.\u201d", "2. Assume good intentions", "The vast majority of remote communication is written, so you lose a lot of physical cues and other contextual information. As a result, much of that external context gets replaced by our own imagination\u2014a fallible source of information, to say the least. Both Martin and Connor urge managers to start with the assumption of good intent in team communications. For example, you might receive a terse email or notice a colleague has read your text but hasn\u2019t replied for a while. \u201cYour mind starts spinning as to why,\u201d says Connor. \u201cThe reality could be that their kid interrupted them or the stove is burning. In these virtual teams, you need to be aware of the story you\u2019re telling yourself and open your mind to other, well-intentioned possibilities.\u201d", "3. Avoid avoidance", "It\u2019s all too easy to push employee issues and conflicts under the rug when you aren\u2019t encountering those people regularly, face-to-face. Managers might be inclined to not address issues at all or tell themselves they\u2019ll wait until the next formal meeting. \u201cThis is dangerous,\u201d Connor warns. \u201cThe person you manage might forget what happened, and you might build up resentment. Push yourself to have the hard conversations more quickly, rather than defaulting to old habits.\u201d And, Martin adds, \u201cif tensions and misunderstandings via written communication persist, move quickly from asynchronous to real-time communication channels. As a general rule, synchronous meeting time is better than email for dealing with tense topics.\u201d", "4. Be honest and upfront about your managerial style", "Martin shares a personal practice from his fully remote career that he encourages other team leaders to explore: creating a shared, written document that sheds light on your personal preferences and idiosyncrasies as a manager. \u201cThere are things you would figure out after working for me in person for a month, but I prefer to put those things out there upfront since my team and I don\u2019t have that in-person interaction.\u201d For example, in his public document \u201cBlueprint to Liam and his Quirks\u201d he shares things like his Myers-Briggs personality type and the fact that he prefers speed over precision\u2014valuable insights for any new hires embarking on their first assignments.", "5. Cultivate culture", "\u201cWhen organisations change quickly from in-person to remote, the working relationships from the office initially carry over. But that social capital starts running out after a few months,\u201d Connor says. As managers change and teams are reconfigured in remote environments, it\u2019s essential to be intentional and deliberate about establishing team culture\u2014you can\u2019t expect it to happen as organically as it does in office-based environments. Have a plan on how to build and grow culture across distance.", "Browse communication courses for executives", "--", "Laura Montgomery is a higher-education expert who blogs for The Economist Careers Network."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["team", "work", "communication", "diffuse", "remote", "quickly", "fully", "tension", "teams", "things", "ways", "environments", "bias", "managers", "connor"], "pubDate": "2020-10-22T12:14:30Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
