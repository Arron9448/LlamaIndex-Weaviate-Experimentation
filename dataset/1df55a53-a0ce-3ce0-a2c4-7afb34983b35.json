Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.", "Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.", "The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.", "Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.", "Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.", "\"No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,\" he says. \"These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.\"", "Keeping cabins calm", "Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock", "Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.", "Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.", "Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.", "Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.", "\"We are strongly against voice calls on planes,\" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: \"NO CELL PHONES.\"", "Related content Is it OK to recline your seat? The great reclining debate", "Flight attendants' opposition is significant.", "They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.", "On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.", "Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.", "\"At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,\" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.", "\"If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.\"", "Passengers advocating for quiet", "Most passengers don't want to listen to their fellow travelers talk on their cell phones. Shutterstock", "Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.", "Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an \"annoying\" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.", "Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.", "\"I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,\" he says. \"It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby.

The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.", "Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.", "Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.", "\"There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. \"But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.\"", "\"The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,\" says Miller. \"There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.\"", "Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.", "Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.", "\"Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,\" he says. \"When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.\"", "Regulatory, practical obstacles", "Texting is already permitted on some airlines.
