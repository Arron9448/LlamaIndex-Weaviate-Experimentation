Connor wore a 2018 archival look by the designer (for whom Connor works as director of brand relations) and the groom, Noah Wunsch, wore a made-to-measure suit in his favorite shade\u2014ruby (a nod to his work as the founder of beverage start-up Ruby Hibiscus Water). The couple\u2019s quiet, quirky, artistic sensibility came through in their wedding. Accordingly, their wedding registry is anything but conventional. Connor was born in Japan and Wunsch is a \u201ctotal Japanophile,\u201d says the bride. \u201cNoah is a big fan of Gaetano Pesce and Shiro Kuramata, and sometimes we need to work around his taste to make it all cohere, but I am now just as obsessed.\u201d Connor describes their home decor aesthetic as a nod to an \u201celevated Rocko\u2019s Modern Life,\u201d adding, \u201cI definitely think we wanted to be true to some of the zaniness and radical design that we enjoy living around.\u201d The couple put together their wedding registry in tandem, says the bride. \u201cThe only challenge was editing it down and then making it more practical and realistic.\u201d In one example, \u201cThe Thermomix that my aunt and uncle got us is the most genius gift for the couple that has a tiny NYC apartment kitchen. [It] makes me so proud everytime I use it.\u201d", "Maximalism and vibrant colors are front and center in the couple\u2019s wedding registry. \u201cA friend of ours got us the Gaetano Pesce placemats and now we are drooling over the coasters, and everything else he does,\u201d Connor shares. \u201cOur friend Philippa Price did the dinner setting for our elopement, and it certainly had an extraterrestrial vibe to it. There may or may not have been a black light involved. The cutlery on our registry is actually the same cutlery we used for dinner, and our dreams of entertaining again someday makes us want more.\u201d The couple\u2019s choice of Estelle stemless glasses in amethyst are \u201ca perfect complement to the Ruby Hibiscus Water that just launched,\u201d says Connor. \u201cOf course, we are addicted and getting everyone else addicted too.\u201d", "Connor and Wunsch also wanted to to prioritize items that had a charitable component, such as a pair of St. Jude spaceship socks. \u201cWe have a growing collection of fun socks, and with a spaceship and a donation element to St. Jude\u2019s, these couldn\u2019t be any better,\u201d says the bride. Another favorite is a backgammon set by Designs that Donate whose proceeds benefit a charity of your choice. In this case, Connor and Wunsch chose the Anti Racism Fund.", "For future brides, Connor recommends, \u201cHave fun with it! We have never aspired to be the couple with the perfect matchy-matchy china and linen tablecloths. We do aspire to be fancy, don\u2019t get me wrong, but in our own sort of weird way. Just be yourself and don\u2019t feel pressured to curate a Nancy Meyers\u2013worthy home.\u201d"], "authors": ["Julie Tong"], "keywords": ["vogue", "wunsch", "registry", "connor", "wedding", "noah", "couples", "couple", "work", "unconventional", "avantgarde", "bride", "wore"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
