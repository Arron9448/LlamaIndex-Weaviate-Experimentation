As vaccines are being distributed, the hope of reemergence is in the air. And with reopening, there is, of course, the fashion. Begone sweatpants, and enter sundresses with bare legs and cropped tops with slivers of midriff! People are starting to dress up again, wearing their favorite clothes for the first days of spring. And the best place to see the world, and the clothes that come with it, start to blossom is in a park. This past weekend, as temperatures hit the 60s, street style photographer Melodie Jeng camped out at Brooklyn\u2019s McCarren Park, a Greenpoint hub for old school locals and young newcomers.", "So what did we see this weekend? Plenty of refreshing fits. One lad went full \u201970s in a head-to-toe cream look with a pair of flares with laser-cut florals on the bottom (for a pop of color, he wore a blue neckerchief). Two young friends took to the town in trends of the moment: One woman opted for a leather jacket, a green miniskirt, slick knee-high cowboy boots and a perpetually chic shoulder bag dangling from her arm. Her friend dared to try out the exposed thong look with a pair of baggy blue jeans, as well as a head-turning orange Kangol hat.", "Outr\u00e9 masks made cameos, too. A duo stepped out in customized denim masks, complementing their noteworthy outfits. One friend wore a buckle around their neck with a bike chain in lieu of a wallet chain. There were also some familiar faces traipsing around. Jeng captured Collina Strada\u2019s Hillary Taymour in a full floral look along with one of her signature masks and her pup by her side. To her left was New York\u2019s beloved rapper-political-candidate-preacher-of-love Paperboy Prince in a pink puffer vest and their teddy bear sneakers.", "Suddenly, the city is starting to look really good again."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei", "Melodie Jen"], "keywords": ["parks", "look", "park", "yorks", "masks", "street", "young", "weekend", "jeng", "blossoming", "starting", "friend", "pair", "style", "wore"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
