Hunt Transport Services Inc. delivered lower-than-expected profits in the fourth quarter, raising concerns for other freight operators.", "The Lowell, Ark.-based company reported a 6% increase in quarterly revenue, to $2.45 billion, compared with the same period in 2018, and diluted earnings per share of $1.35, compared with 81 cents in 2018. Analysts had forecast diluted earnings per share of $1.50, according to FactSet.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "\u201cThe quarter was weak across the board,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a Friday research note. Challenges in freight brokerage were \u201cbigger than expected,\u201d he wrote, presenting \u201ca bad read across for\u201d C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., the largest freight broker in North America, which reports results later this month.", "J.B. Hunt shares were off 5.5% in Friday midafternoon trading, to $113.20 per share.", "The company reported net earnings of $144.7 million for the quarter.

Hunt\u2019s intermodal business moving freight by truck and rail.", "Slow growth in J.B. Hunt\u2019s intermodal truck-rail segment, its largest, weighed down results.

Hunt\u2019s head of intermodal, said in a Friday investor call. \u201cAnd until we can offer economics and service combined that outperform truck, we\u2019re going to be challenged there.\u201d", "J.B. Hunt also reported an $11.8 million operating loss in freight brokerage, an area in which the company has been investing heavily in technology to expand its digital freight platform.", "The company expects to add between 800 and 1,000 trucks to its dedicated contract services unit, which handles outsourced trucking services for shipping customers and includes its growing last-mile delivery business.
