And yet its birthrate has converged with the rich world much more quickly and completely \u2014 which has two interrelated implications, both of them grim.", "First, China will have to pay for the care of a vast elderly population without the resources available to richer societies facing the same challenge. Second, China\u2019s future growth prospects will dim with every year of below-replacement birthrates, because low fertility creates a self-reinforcing cycle \u2014 in which a less youthful society loses dynamism and growth, which reduces economic support for would-be parents, which reduces birthrates, which reduces growth \u2026", "The Times report on China\u2019s birthrates also reminds us that this trap is cultural, quoting a young Chinese woman who remarks of her one-child-policy-shaped generation: \u201cWe are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish \u2026 How can I raise a child when I\u2019m still a child myself?\u201d This is the glib explication of a real problem: Having kids, inevitably one of the harder things that human beings do, feels harder still in a society where children are invisible, siblings absent, and large families rare, where there aren\u2019t ready exemplars or forms of solidarity for people contemplating parenthood.", "In all this, what China is experiencing is part of the common demographic decadence of the developed world, which is enveloping developing countries too. As Lyman Stone writes in the latest National Review, the human race is increasingly facing a \u201cglobal fertility crisis,\u201d not just a European or American or Japanese baby bust. It\u2019s a crisis that threatens ever-slower growth in the best case; in the worst-case, to cite a recent paper by the Stanford economist Charles Jones, it risks \u201can Empty Planet result: knowledge and living standards stagnate for a population that gradually vanishes.\u201d", "(An aside to answer a predictable objection: Yes, in an age of stagnation, CO2 levels won\u2019t grow as fast, delaying some of climate change\u2019s effects \u2014 but at the same time a stagnant society will struggle to innovate enough to escape the climate crisis permanently. And yes, an empty planet wouldn\u2019t have a climate change problem at all, but if that\u2019s your goal your misanthropy is terminal.)"], "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "keywords": ["chinese", "climate", "growth", "yes", "problem", "society", "birthrates", "opinion", "population", "world", "reduces", "crisis"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
