His latest complaint centered on the fact that he couldn\u2019t see the characters behind various doors and windows, and he had to interact with disembodied voices instead. \u201c[From Software] are so freaking lazy!\u201d he shouted before pausing the game to watch a video on how to kill the Maneater Boar after encountering the beast and immediately getting trampled to death.", "\u201cThis is such lazy game design,\u201d he exclaimed after finally felling the creature, thanks to the help from a tutorial video that showed how to roll away from the big pig\u2019s attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not even really that hard. They just make bosses do unfair stuff to make the game seem longer. Lazy.\u201d", "Jarvis' anger increased when he encountered the Shadow of Yharnam boss. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he yelled. \u201cThis is just three of the same guys! They couldn\u2019t even be bothered to make three different guys. Unbelievable.\u201d", "His roommate, Patricia Jarvis, 49, pointed out that each of the three Shadows appeared to have different weapons and attack patterns, which elicited more ranting from Jarvis. \u201cThis sucks. I\u2019m not wasting my time with this garbage,\u201d Jarvis said, before watching several additional tutorial videos. Hours later, after being repeatedly burned, stabbed, and killed by snakes, Jarvis finally defeated the trio. \u201cAfter all that hard work, there wasn\u2019t even a cool death animation or anything. How hard could that be?!\u201d", "Jarvis spent the rest of the weekend completing Bloodborne after summoning other players into his game using the Beckoning Bell. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have online matchmaking,\u201d he told one player. \u201cSo, so lazy. And thanks for beating Vicar Amelia for me; I don\u2019t have the right weapon for it right now.\u201d"], "authors": ["Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Darth Clark Is The Totally Real Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Which Appears Annually In Game Informer", "Usually Around April Fool S Day .
