With such a concentration of warehouses, or bodegas, in one spot, sherry is quite literally all around you\u2014a wonderful, rich aroma seemingly moving with you from one block to the next.", "It\u2019s a place where the industry for a time grew larger than the town. \u201cWe reached a point where the city just had to grow around it,\u201d says Simon Leth-Nissen, international brand manager for sherry producer Gonz\u00e1lez Byass. Consider that in 1855, the company accounted for 2% of Spain\u2019s exports\u2014not wine exports, but all products.", "Indeed, Jerez de la Frontera is the home and heart of sherry.", "What is Sherry?", "Sherry is a Spanish fortified wine, and the city of Jerez is actually one point of the \u201csherry triangle,\u201d a collection of three towns, including Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, in which the whole of the sherry industry is contained.", "The industry has had its ups and downs, and as a result today it\u2019s perhaps best known for its role in the maturation of whisky. That\u2019s a cruel injustice to this complex and beguiling fortified wine, a prestigious product made by a proud people with quality and care, and built on the foundation of centuries of history. A visit to Jerez is perhaps the only way to fully appreciate the category.", "\u201cYou have to be here\u2014smell the air. Look, touch, see how deep it runs here,\u201d says Mario Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez, a portfolio manager for the sherry producer Lustau. At Lustau, that might mean observing the thick spider webs entombing some of its casks\u2014the spiders protecting the wood from pests\u2014as you wander cool, damp warehouses, buildings positioned in particular alignment to properly capitalize on favorable breezes.", "A beguiling fortified wine, sherry is prestigious product made by a proud people with quality and care, and built on the foundation of centuries of history. Jake Emen", "Styles of Sherry", "With sherry production, there\u2019s a limited collection of grapes to work with. \u201cWe are rather lucky here in Jerez because we can only use three varieties,\u201d Leth-Nissen says.", "Those three grapes include Palomino Fino, Moscatel, and Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, though Palomino makes up 95% of production. But sherry is still remarkably varied, depending on how the maturation is accomplished and for how long, where the wine comes from, and the strength and sweetness of the wine.", "The most important distinction may be in understanding the difference between what sherry producers call biological aging versus oxidative aging. Biological aging occurs when the sherry wine within a barrel is contained under a film of yeast on the surface known as flor. Fino is a dry sherry made from the Palomino Fino grape, aged entirely under flor for a minimum of two years. \u201cTio Pepe is a classic Fino, our flag bearer, and the most sold sherry in the world,\u201d Leth-Nissen says.", "Manzanilla sherry is made in the same way, but hails only from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, one of the three points of the triangle. \u201cFinos and Manzanilla are the same in every way except for the location it\u2019s being aged,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez says.", "\u201cThe Amontillado is a development of the Fino,\u201d Leth-Nissen says. If you continue to age Fino long enough, eventually the yeast can\u2019t survive due to the higher alcohol levels present. Alternatively, producers can also shave years off the process by refortifying the wine to kill off the yeast directly after an initial period spent under flor. The maturation spent without flor is known as oxidative, and Amontillado therefore undergoes both.", "Oloroso sherry is fortified at the start to a level which won\u2019t support the yeast, therefore undergoing entirely oxidative aging. All of the above, a huge range of styles, is entirely based off a single grape. \u201cIt\u2019s all the Palomino grape, with the differences based on the decisions we make along the way,\u201d Leth-Nissen says.", "Palo Cortado, meanwhile, has a mysterious origin, essentially as a Fino gone wrong, with the flor dying off before maturation is finished. (Fluctuations in humidity or temperature, or incorrectly estimating alcohol content and therefore over-fortifying the wine, are all ways the flor could be killed accidentally).", "Jamie Gonzalez, proprietor of the family-run Bodegas Faustino Gonzalez, producer of the Cruz Vieja line of sherry. Jake Emen", "\u201cThe real Palo Cortado is one you cannot make,\u201d says Jamie Gonz\u00e1lez, proprietor of the family-run Bodegas Faustino Gonz\u00e1lez, producer of the Cruz Vieja line of sherry. \u201cIt\u2019s an oenological accident. That's the real Palo Cortado.\u201d", "The phrase palo cortado means \u201ccut stick,\u201d referring to the marks a producer would make on a barrel to indicate what he was storing inside. A single vertical line represented Fino, but when the flor would die off, a horizontal line was made slicing across it, cutting or canceling what had been a Fino.", "In modern practice, Palo Cortado is of course purposefully made, and it need not always begin its life under the flor. \u201cToday, the only regulation is that it is supposed to have an elegant fine nose like the Amontillado but a more structured palate like the Oloroso,\u201d Leth-Nissen says.", "For me, it\u2019s from the family Oloroso,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cWhen you have a very old Oloroso and a very old Palo Cortado it\u2019 hard to tell the difference.\u201d", "Finally, it\u2019s time to consider the other grapes. Medium, or cream, sherries are blends of Palomino with PX or Moscatel grapes; the more of the latter two varieties are added, the sweeter the resulting wine. Sherry can also be made entirely from Pedro Xim\u00e9nez or Moscatel. And these are some of the sweetest wines in the world,\u201d Leth-Nissen says.", "The Mathematical Magic of the Solera", "Regardless of the type of sherry being produced, the solera is fundamental to its development. Wines of different ages are mingled together, the old wines providing depth, the young wines providing vibrancy, and the ongoing process offering an inimitable, consistent house style for a particular sherry.", "\u201cThe solar system is the beginning and the end of everything in Jerez,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cIt\u2019s less magical and more mathematical, actually.\u201d", "The solera is technically the bottom row of a three or four-level stack of barrels. The barrels in the solera, containing the oldest wines, are never entirely emptied. Instead, a portion generally between 25% and 33% is removed for bottling, and replaced with wine from the next oldest row of barrels above it in the first criadera, which is refilled with wine from the second criadera, which is topped off by the sobretablas, the freshly fortified wine from the latest harvest.", "This creates wines with average ages rather than coming from specific harvests or vintages. Certain producers, though, including both Gonz\u00e1lez Byass and Lustau, do offer vintage sherries in tiny amounts accounting for about 1% of production.", "At Lustau, thick spider webs entomb some of its casks-the spiders protecting the wood from pests. Jake Emen", "Reinvigorating the Market", "\u201cThe solera delivers the same quality, the same consistency, the same personality,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez says.", "That stability is crucial, though in modern days, it\u2019s actually somewhat of a hindrance in the wine world, a market often powered by the limited supply of exceptional releases. Producers are starting to offer rarer and more limited offerings, such as Tio Pepe En Rama from Gonz\u00e1lez Byass. En rama essentially translates to \u201craw,\u201d which makes these sherries as near an approximation to drinking from the barrel as possible. \u201cIt basically means the wine doesn\u2019t go through filtration or stabilization,\u201d Leth-Nissen says. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest to what you get to the natural state of Tio Pepe.\u201d", "The annual spring release began a decade ago, with a few dozen casks hand-selected by master blender Antonio Flores. \u201cWe also see a new concept for sherry with Tio Pepe En Rama, the concept of bottle aging,\u201d says Silvia Flores, Antonio\u2019s daughter who\u2019s now an assistant winemaker with the company. \u201cThe wine continues to develop over time.\u201d", "At Faustino Gonz\u00e1lez, all of the sherries Jamie produces are en rama. \u201cIt\u2019s all en rama, it\u2019s more natural,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cWe are real artisans. We don't make wines. I only care for and select wines. Wine is natural.\u201d", "That doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t ventured into the realm of premium, limited releases. In 2018, he released the Cruz Vieja Oloroso Muy Vieja, a highly limited release of only 120 bottles taken from a three-barrel solera system over a century in age. It\u2019s only the second time Faustino Gonz\u00e1lez has made it available, following a similarly scantly-sized offering in 1996. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely singular,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says, \u201cthis is for meditation.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-magic-of-sherry-in-jerez-01570210653?mod=hp_minor_pos27"}
