It\u2019s interesting. Because they\u2019re doing things distant on Zoom and such, you\u2019d think that they wouldn\u2019t be as concerned because they\u2019re able to work from home, but it\u2019s given people an opportunity to be more critical of themselves. So, instead of waiting until next week, or next month, to go get their Botox treatment, they want it regularly because they don\u2019t know when they will have that important meeting coming up, and they just consistently want to look their best.", "I think we want to try to have some grasp on a normal lifestyle again, and one of the things that makes us feel good is when we go ahead and pamper ourselves\u2026 People are looking at this as an opportunity, or maybe even a necessity, for their wellness and state of mind, to pamper themselves a little bit more. So they\u2019re being more regular about their injections and treatments, and I\u2019ve noticed it in that the \"regulars\" are being very adamant when they want their treatment. And I see more people becoming regulars, as far as that goes.", "Fox News: Do clients specifically request procedures to enhance their appearance over online video platforms?", "Chiu: People still want to look great, and feel better for themselves, if nothing else. Here in L.A., a lot of patients who are regular with these treatments have a very regular need to interact, for whatever they do for work.", "There\u2019s various reasons [for plastic surgery] and the interesting thing is that the pandemic actually increased the need for it, because when you\u2019re doing an interaction on these high-definition cameras \u2014 the \"Zoom boom\" \u2013 people want to make sure they\u2019re looking their best for these things.", "We don\u2019t see [demand] changing. Everyone\u2019s reporting that virtual events and virtual work is going to be here to stay. Like Elton John announced, he\u2019s going to have virtual pre- and post-parties for the Oscars this year.", "CORONAVIRUS FACE MASK USE SAFE DURING INTENSE EXERCISE, EARLY RESEARCH SUGGESTS", "FOX: When is there usually the most demand for these treatments in Hollywood?", "Chiu: In the past, there would be a hiatus before the gala season, or awards season. Patients would get their little quick nips and tucks done at the beginning of the hiatus, heal through the hiatus, and be ready for their red carpet moments. Now that things have changed, I saw patients come in earlier.", "In other words, without filming and with a lot of Hollywood being on hold\u2026 I\u2019ve been accommodating more of those patients earlier than their typical time period so they have a little extra time to go ahead and do things. With regards to more \"in the moment\" preparations, clients coming in for rejuvenation and treatments\u2026 they're looking for a game plan. They have more time and flexibility, as opposed to having meetings to go to, or readings to do.", "The great thing is that technology and treatments [in this industry] have only gotten better. It hasn\u2019t stopped for us. A lot of new treatments, machinery and products have come out this past year.

Chemical peels that have relatively low downtime, if any at all, because of course [the clients] couldn\u2019t afford that if they were doing their readings and everything else, trying to go for parts during their hiatus.", "Now, we can do deeper peels and other kinds of treatments. There\u2019s a new treatment called the Forma facial, and it\u2019s very similar to another product called Clear + Brilliant, but I guess you can say more advanced. A new term that\u2019s come about for this type of treatment is the \"Zoom facial.\" Its radio-frequency energy being applied to your skin, cause a little plumping of the skin immediately. Long-term, it reduces the looks of fine lines, wrinkles and shrinks your pores \u2014 all the similar things that you hope over the long term that facials will do.", "Microneedling is also a long-term thing for improvement, because you are looking for your tissues to be stimulated and rejuvenate. But there are microneedling treatments \u2014 for instance, Morpheus 8 \u2014 where the microneedles also give off a radio frequency. The technology is new. It\u2019s really radiating from the tips, and going back into the tips. It\u2019s definitely a different form of radio frequency treatment, and what it\u2019s doing is stimulating the tissues to tighten up.", "The Morpheus 8 gives a permanent tightening and lifting reorganization of the collagen of your skin, and the immediate effects that you see are pretty long-lasting. That\u2019s when, for instance, you\u2019re using it under the chin, or on your body, and again it has nice long term improvements for the skin itself and tightening of the skin.", "CLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE", "All the different things we would do in the past \u2014 mild to medium chemical peels, the light laser treatment, LED light treatments, Botox, fillers \u2013 all these things are still being done, but clients are wanting a game plan of multiple modalities in order to attack the concerns from various treatment levels, and of course, this will give them a better result in the long run.", "A board-certified surgeon specializing in plastic and reconstructive surgery, Chiu is a graduate of the University of California Berkeley and Western University of Health Sciences."], "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle."], "keywords": ["remain", "little", "patients", "virtual", "procedures", "theyre", "treatments", "chiu", "skin", "plastic", "dr", "treatment", "empire", "popular", "netflixs", "gabriel", "things", "cosmetic", "pandemic", "surgery"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
