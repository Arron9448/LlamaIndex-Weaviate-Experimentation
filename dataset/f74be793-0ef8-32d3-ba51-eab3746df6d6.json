We don\u2019t think it has been and gone.\u201d", "She also noted that in Oxford, where she works, about 20% of people admitted were usually urgent referrals but this proportion had shot up to 80%.", "Separately, data released on Thursday shows huge rises in waiting times for young people and children, with a 128% increase in the number waiting for routine treatment compared with last year.", "There has been a fourfold increase in the number of children and young people waiting for urgent treatment from October, November and December 2019 compared with the same months a year later.", "In that period, there has been a 41% increase in the number of children and young people completing treatment and an 86% increase in the number of children and young people completing urgent treatment.", "Only 72.7% of children and young people started treatment within one week of referral \u2013 the lowest percentage achieved for three years.", "Ayton said there was no comparable data for adults, where numbers are also rising.
