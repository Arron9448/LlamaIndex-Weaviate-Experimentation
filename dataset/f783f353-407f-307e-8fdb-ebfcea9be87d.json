The 1995 cyberpunk almost-classic captures a pre-Matrix, pre-Cyberpunk 2077 Reeves at his most cartoonishly buttoned-up, all hunk and monosyllabic monomindedness. His first line of dialog, \u201cYeah,\u201d pretty much says it all: I am here, in bed with a hooker, so yeah, let\u2019s do this. The movie has never been considered classy cinema, but thanks to the interoperability of stay-at-home orders, streaming, and the Keanaissance, nerd-dom revived it in 2020, and not a moment too soon. Because 2021\u2014welcome!\u2014is the year in which Johnny Mnemonic, the story of a mysterious epidemic and the one man who might put an end to it, is set.", "So, yeah.", "Does science fiction predict the future? The question, particularly that verb, predict, irritates all the greats. The genre ain\u2019t predictive, huffed Le Guin, it\u2019s descriptive. I\u2019m a preventer of futures, claimed Bradbury, not a predictor of them. (Let\u2019s see about that next year, if/when the 2022 of his Fahrenheit 451 comes to pass.) In 1981, a then-unknown William Gibson, raised on writers like Bradbury, published a hot little neon-noir in Omni called \u201cJohnny Mnemonic.\u201d Many years later, enthroned as the father of cyberpunk, he\u2019d say of his work that \u201cit\u2019s not prescient.\u201d Look around, though. Prediction might not be the intent of science fiction, but humanity seems to suffer a desperate, ever-darkening desire to see as much of it as possible come true.", "Johnny is a digital-era delivery guy. If you need some data transported hypersecurely, simply load it into his head and off he goes: your very own walking\u2014more often running, from bad guys\u2014USB air-gapped meatstick. So what if the gig comes with memory lacunae and the risk, in the event of information overload, of brain-burst, to say nothing of the Yakuza at your back, who are more than happy to carry out a file transfer by way of decapitation? It pays well, and you look cyber-cool doing it.", "Of course, the Yakuza aren\u2019t the real villains. Neither is the random psychotic bionic street preacher played by Dolph Lundgren, whom Gibson and first-time/last-time director Robert Longo, when they went to turn the short story into a movie, had to make room for. (Blame the studio.) Turns out there\u2019s an evil shadow corporation behind it all, Pharmakom. They\u2019re the ones who sic the Yakuza on Johnny, because they know what\u2019s inside Johnny\u2019s computerbrain: the cure to a mass plague called NAS. That\u2019s nerve attenuation syndrome, aka the black shakes. If it stays incurable, Pharmakom can keep treating it half-assedly. They don\u2019t want Johnny spoiling their profits.", "So it\u2019s a big Big Pharma cover-up. In our 2021, in our global pandemic, could such a plotline be construed as, in fact, prophetic? Pfizer, Moderna, et al. aren\u2019t withholding any cures. Quite the opposite: They\u2019re rushing out efficacious Covid vaccines, in lockstep with federal guidelines, to the people who need them most. Yet Pharmakomish suspicions still remain. Even a small, deep-down part of you may want to believe them, these big, out-there seductions. Microchips in the medicines. Cheaper therapies \u201cthey\u201d are actively suppressing. Paranoia has coursed through this Covid catastrophe like water (which fluoridation has definitely made stupidifying). In the first week of 2021, New York magazine published a cover story by a novelist claiming SARS-CoV-2 was born in a lab. Not as a weapon, no no; this isn\u2019t science fiction. Just some US-funded Chinese virologists hot-swapping mutant spike proteins in the name of research and in the process manufacturing a human-infecting virus that accidentally gets out and spreads globally. Sort of like what happens in 28 Days Later, or Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And, you know, not unlike the technopharmacological fuckups at the center of Splice, Mission: Impossible II, The Boys, etc. etc."], "authors": ["Jason Kehe", "Jason Keh"], "keywords": ["yakuza", "2021", "big", "conspiracies", "theyre", "mnemonic", "reeves", "fiction", "johnny", "say", "science", "yeah"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
