Thunderstorms are a good omen, Prakash tells me. She was born during a thunderstorm; Varshini means \u201cthe one who brings the rain\u201d in Sanskrit (her family is from the now drought-ravaged Indian city of Chennai). It thundered when she proposed to her partner, Filipe de Carvalho, 25 (another Sunriser), on a Brazilian beach in late November, as it did earlier that month during Sunrise\u2019s occupation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, the action that catapulted the Green New Deal, and the Sunrise Movement with it, to the forefront of the nation\u2019s conversation on climate.", "More than 200 activists in their teens and early 20s lined the halls of the Cannon House Office Building in D.C. that day, holding signs saying we need the green new deal, do your job, and no more excuses. Fifty-one were arrested for unlawful demonstration, and the protest produced a flood of coverage\u2014some 4,000 articles about the Green New Deal with Ocasio-Cortez as the face of it, bolstered by ranks of Sunrisers, wide-eyed and resolute, perp-walked in plasticuffs. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that they\u2019ve managed to find the youngest and most charismatic congresswoman that there\u2019s ever been,\u201d says Bill McKibben, the pioneering environmentalist author, \u201cbecause that describes their movement, too.\u201d", "\u201cKids these days are lit and ready to go,\u201d says Prakash of Sunrise\u2019s base, which is trending increasingly younger\u2014it\u2019s not uncommon to find preteens at their rallies and events. Born too late to be seduced by the promises of Reaganite neoliberalism and coming of age between late\u2013Obama era languor and early\u2013Trump era despair, Sunrise\u2019s members are furious at what they see as inaction on climate and ready to take matters into their own hands. In this they\u2019re joined by young, angry activists around the world. \u201cThat\u2019s been a huge shift over the past year with Sunrise\u2019s organizing and the global student climate strikes that were inspired by Greta Thunberg in Sweden,\u201d says Naomi Klein, activist and author of 2014\u2019s best-selling This Changes Everything. \u201cI think young people have a particular moral voice that is just getting stronger and clearer, a combination of optimism and existential terror. There\u2019s also a rage and rightful disappointment with the people who were supposed to protect their future.\u201d", "Like Prakash, Sara Blazevic, 26, is one of Sunrise\u2019s cofounders (there are eight in total, most of whom cut their teeth working on fossil fuel\u2013divestment campaigns at their respective colleges, then were spurred to wider action by Bernie Sanders\u2019s first presidential campaign). Blazevic wears a discreet nose ring, a trout tattoo on her inner arm, and projects an air of serene competence. \u201cAlmost everybody in Sunrise has lived our entire lives in a world on the cusp of climate apocalypse,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s what drives them\u2014just the sheer scale of the devastation on the horizon.\u201d Last fall the United Nations\u2019 scientific panel on climate change underscored how close that horizon has come, warning that the world community has 12 years to prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius, the cutoff for averting catastrophe. Meanwhile, President Trump has relentlessly mocked climate science and heaped scorn on the Green New Deal, even as the major Democratic presidential candidates have all embraced it in some way. \u201cIt would be unwise to discount Sunrise\u2019s capacity to keep this front and center,\u201d says Klein. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve never seen this much attention paid to climate change in an electoral cycle.\u201d", "In the six weeks I spent at Sunrise rallies, boot camps, and debate parties this summer, the young activists I met seemed caught between idealism and fury\u2014and a longing to escape to different worlds. Meisenhelter, who grew up in a commune with goats in Portland, Oregon, routinely shares favorite fantasy or science fiction with her fellow Sunrisers. \u201cOrganizing is making science fiction real,\u201d she says. Prakash nods vehemently; she is currently reading Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s The Lathe of Heaven, which describes a dystopian American Northwest ravaged by climate change. (Though Harry Potter is her favorite of the genre\u2014\u201cDuh! Is that even a question?!\u201d\u2014and there are plans to name the conference rooms in the new D.C. Sunrise offices after Hogwarts houses.) Growing up, Prakash and her school friend would take Bridge to Terabithia\u2013type adventures into the woods behind their homes in Acton, Massachusetts. \u201cAll of the people I know spent lots of time in imagined worlds,\u201d she says.", "Pulling off I-64, we stop at Bojangles and order Bo-Berries (blueberry-muffin biscuits) drenched in icing. Prakash digs into the Styrofoam box and shrugs when I ask about her own consumption habits. \u201cIf eating fast food on the tour means that in five years we\u2019ve passed legislation that has changed the system, then I think that\u2019s okay,\u201d she says, adding that this is a crucial generational divide. \u201cOlder generations were like \u2018Change your light bulb, change your life\u2019 and this generation is thinking, Let\u2019s change these systems.\u201d", "It is the older generation that has leveled the sharpest criticisms of the Green New Deal, which demands a complete transition to a carbon-neutral economy in the next decade, requiring nothing less than a total overhaul of the nation\u2019s infrastructure. This would cost trillions, on top of the plan\u2019s proposals for government-funded or subsidized health care, education, jobs, and housing. The rebukes from Republicans were predictably unanimous, but there was pointed criticism from longtime climate advocates on the left as well. Speaker Pelosi dismissed it as \u201cthe green dream, or whatever they call it; nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it, right?\u201d while Michael Bloomberg, who in June committed $500 million to help transition away from the fossil-fuel economy, cautioned against promoting a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d proposal.", "In July, centrist Democrats in the House presented a more moderate plan to curb carbon emissions by 2050 rather than the Green New Deal\u2019s eyebrow-raisingly ambitious goal of 2030. \u201cWe are inspired by the energy, activism, and outside mobilizing of the Sunrise Movement and the millions of young people across the country who are using their power to bring about transformational change,\u201d Speaker Pelosi wrote me in an email. \u201cGuided by their voices and the vision and values of our caucus, House Democrats are taking decisive action to defend the people and places we love.\u201d When I speak to Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University and a former legal counsel in the Obama administration, she tells me that while she admires the ambitiousness of the plan, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the folks pushing these policies have a pragmatic view of what is possible, given how hard this is politically.\u201d", "But ambition is the point, says Klein. \u201cI understand that it sounds more practical to just have a narrow climate policy, but we live in a time of tremendous economic stress and hardship, and if we aren\u2019t able to show people that it is possible to tackle the climate crisis while actually improving quality of life, we will keep losing.\u201d She cites France\u2019s Yellow Vest riots, spurred by the introduction of a petroleum tax largely shouldered by the working class, as a cautionary tale for incremental change.", "From the beginning, Sunrise has aimed to draw the support of labor groups by including plans for so-called green jobs, but while some unions have voiced support for the Green New Deal, many have loudly denounced it. This fuels worry about a fracturing Democratic Party where the firebrand progressive left drives away working-class voters, laying the groundwork for a Trump 2020 victory. Freeman also says she finds Sunrise\u2019s choice of targets\u2014Pelosi and Senator Dianne Feinstein, for example\u2014puzzling. \u201cI mean, these are people who would be considered allies on climate change,\u201d she says.", "When I ask Prakash about all of this on our drive to D.C., she is emphatic: \u201cI think if you\u2019re not creating some kind of tension and illuminating the difference between where we are right now and where we need to be, you\u2019re not doing a very good job as a social movement.\u201d Wide and urgent, her eyes meet mine in the rearview mirror. \u201cWhat is defeating Trump?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre you going to defeat Trump with a pathetic and tepid vision for America? Hillary ran on America\u2019s already great, and that just is not resonant.\u201d Joe Biden, she adds, has emerged with the same message: \u201c \u2018Oh, Trump was just a bad dream. If you make me president, we will wake up from it.\u2019 \u201d She raises both hands off the wheel; the gray light filters through her beige glitter nails, a gel manicure she got in Detroit before their tour stop three weeks earlier. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand that things have fundamentally changed!\u201d", "Onstage at Howard University, in Washington, D.C., five-foot-tall Prakash bounces up and down, hyping the crowd. She wears a Green New Deal T-shirt knotted at the back to make it more fitted and faux suede black booties from Forever 21 (\u201cJust like our movement,\u201d deadpans Meisenhelter). Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders are among the rally\u2019s speakers, and Prakash is serving as M.C. She begins the event as she has all of the Sunrise\u2019s tour stops, by acknowledging the original keepers of the land we are on, in this case the Piscataway tribe, and asking for a moment of silence. She ends it by gesticulating fiercely, pointing and slicing through the air with a call and response. \u201cDo you all remember how many questions were asked about climate change in the 2016 or 2012 general election?\u201d \u201cZero!\u201d the audience yells back. \u201cThis is the year we have to change the debate.\u201d", "Sunrise\u2019s ability to rally the very young can be a powerful asset. When a gaggle of preteens, some of them only 11, confronted Senator Feinstein in her San Francisco office in March, her curt dismissal of them as non-negotiating na\u00effs went viral, proving that not taking the youth climate movement seriously is a grave mistake. \u201cSunrise\u2019s youth has opened up space and places where no other demographic could get in,\u201d says Rhiana Gunn-Wright of the think tank New Consensus and the policy architect behind the Green New Deal. There are also potential liabilities. Part of Blazevic\u2019s job at the Pelosi sit-in was to ensure that no one under 18 got arrested, and Meisenhelter made \u201cmom calls\u201d during an action at Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s office. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotional support for the moms of 12-year-olds during rallies,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to calm them down.\u201d", "But the youthful ranks of Sunrisers keeps growing, and a month after the Howard University rally, I attend a boot camp in Stony Point, New York, for 58 incoming Sunrise \u201cfellows,\u201d ages 18 to 25\u2014almost all of whom will move into dorm-style Sunrise Movement Houses for three to six months, in a variety of roles, to help carry the weight of the organization\u2019s expansion. In 2018, Sunrise\u2019s operating budget was $850,000; this year that number has risen to $4.5 million (fueled by fund-raising, which is a 60\u201340 split between grants and individual donations). Last June, no media outlet would respond to Sunrise\u2019s press releases; this week, The New York Times sends a five-person video crew to the boot camp to film an episode of The Weekly, the TV show inspired by the popular podcast The Daily, and Politico sends a reporter and photographer for a major feature.", "Victoria Fernandez, 26, a cofounder wearing lilac color-blocked Outdoor Voices leggings, a battered copy of 2016\u2019s grassroots manual Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything lolling out of her backpack, leads a training session. \u201cIt was only once Cardi B got haters that you knew she was famous,\u201d Fernandez says, noting that Fox News devoted three times as much coverage to the Green New Deal as CNN and MSNBC combined. The room of new fellows snaps enthusiastically in approval, sounding like a drove of cicadas. Fernandez then starts a round of Sunrise Jeopardy with trivia categories such as Make It Hopeful and Big Us, Narrow Them. \u201cWe need our villains to feel conquerable,\u201d she says. For example, she says, refer to the fossil-fuel industry as fossil-fuel \u201celites,\u201d so as not to alienate the industry\u2019s workers.", "Fellows are encouraged to tell their personal stories as acts of \u201cpublic narrative.\u201d", "Nineteen-year-old Munira Berhe, smiling and moon-faced and wearing a black hijab, says she is here because droughts in the Horn of Africa affected her family in Ethiopia. Like most Sunrisers, Berhe does not fit the environmental-movement clich\u00e9 of the white, hacky sack\u2013toting trustafarian. A rising sophomore at Minneapolis Community College, Berhe has nails painted neon yellow and clutches her iPhone emblazoned with a Glossier sticker (her favorite product is the Boy Brow). For her and many of the fellows, 2020 will be the first election they are old enough to vote in. \u201cThere was nothing worse than seeing 2016 happen and not being able to do anything,\u201d says Maggie Herndon, 19. \u201cI wanted to use my power once I knew I had it.\u201d I ask if she or any of the others would be here if Hillary had won. \u201cI don\u2019t think Sunrise would be here,\u201d says Emily Thompson, 19. There\u2019s some debate over this point, but Allie Lindstrom, 21, agrees with a sigh, \u201cI would never say Trump winning is good, but we\u2019ve been able to use that energy.\u201d", "Before that night\u2019s taco dinner, Emily LaShelle, a 21-year-old with a blonde Megan Rapinoe\u2013esque coif, leads a song workshop. One of four daughters of a former Evangelical pastor from Bozeman, Montana, LaShelle explains that the unifying power of song in the church applies to movement building. Quartets cluster in the hall with the assignment to write a Sunrise-inspired verse to a classic song. ABBA\u2019s Dancing Queen becomes \u201cGee N Dee/Saves the Earth and economeee/Oh, yeah. . . .\u201d Three different groups rewrite lyrics to Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road: \u201cAOC\u2019s got our back/Markey is on track/Biden\u2019s plan is whack/Elites feelin\u2019 attacked.\u201d", "The mood is playful and sometimes astoundingly earnest (there is a gratitude Slack channel, and most Sunrisers ask permission before hugging each other in greeting). But taped to a wall behind a group presenting their parody of \u201cOld MacDonald\u201d\u2014naturally changed to \u201cOld McConnell\u201d\u2014there are savvy diagrams of how to stand during a protest for maximum visual impact. When I leave the retreat center, I feel confident that this is not the last time I will see many of these young people. \u201cMy big hope for this country is that a lot of those activists ultimately end up running for office,\u201d says Heather Zichal, a former Obama adviser and climate-policy consultant for Biden\u2019s campaign.", "A few weeks later it is the eve of the first Democratic debates, and more than two dozen Sunrisers have spent the night on the brick steps of the Democratic National Committee offices in D.C. (fed by Domino\u2019s sent by the Sanders campaign). Their demand? A Democratic debate devoted to climate. Days later the DNC agrees to put it to a committee vote in late August. This kind of success keeps happening; the targets set are met sooner than anticipated. \u201cI keep thinking to myself, Are we not asking for enough?\u201d wonders Fernandez. \u201cWe keep setting goals and then reaching them like that.\u201d She snaps.", "This fall Sunrise will roll out a bigger fellowship and expand its Movement House program, including hubs in key electoral states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. It will continue growing through the presidential election, and there are plans for \u201cmass civil disobedience\u201d in 2021 to help usher in the Green New Deal, says Blazevic. When I ask what happens if Trump wins, Sunrise leadership all respond with varying degrees of dejection. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pretend that our strategy isn\u2019t banking on a very narrow window of opportunity,\u201d admits Will Lawrence, a cofounder who, at 28, with a tightly groomed beard, is somewhat of a village elder in the movement. \u201cBecause it\u2019s always been that way.\u201d", "They all are startlingly optimistic on the prospect of a Democratic president\u2019s passing some version of the Green New Deal. \u201cIt\u2019s possible you could see quite a bit of talk about it during the campaign, but then it may not be the top issue for a new president,\u201d cautions Harvard\u2019s Jody Freeman, noting that moderate Democrats from fossil-fuel states will make passing sweeping climate legislation difficult. However, she is quick to point out that \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between policy and politics. I don\u2019t think [the Green New Deal] is \u2018politically achievable,\u2019 but I think it might be a very useful political strategy.\u201d McKibben agrees, which is why it is important to do this work in the primaries. \u201cBecause now, if Joe Biden gets elected, he has a set of commitments that we can then hold him to.\u201d", "I\u2019m in Boston with Prakash and her fianc\u00e9, de Carvalho, a volunteer leader at Sunrise\u2019s hub here and a data analyst at Liberty Mutual. He is only a few inches taller than Prakash, and seeing the couple embracing over a Friendly\u2019s ice cream cake (it\u2019s his 25th birthday) is a reminder of how young they are. The two met at University of Massachusetts Amherst when both were engaged in political organizing, Prakash working on fossil-fuel divestment, de Carvalho on student-debt relief, but, says Prakash, they fell in love when he taught her how to powerlift. They hope to marry in 2020, but the election \u201cwill probably mess that up,\u201d she says. In the meantime she wears an engagement ring with andalusite, a lower-conflict, lower-priced diamond alternative. \u201cI like it because it looks like the Earth,\u201d she says of the swirling ocher-colored gem (her own birthday is Earth Day). The couple lives in a diverse coastal neighborhood in East Boston that Prakash often points out will not exist in several years due to rising sea levels. They love to go salsa dancing at a nightclub in Cambridge, and will properly celebrate de Carvalho\u2019s birthday this weekend go-karting in downtown Boston.", "We gather to watch the first of the Democratic debates at a community center near the Boston Common, and the countdown is like New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cTwo minutes!\u201d someone yells breathlessly. The energy stays high throughout the first hour with shouts of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Lizzie\u201d when Warren comes out of the gates arguing for her green manufacturing plan, and \u201cYou\u2019re Irish!\u201d when Beto fumbles in Spanish, but wanes as hour two begins and barely 10 words have been said about climate change. (The July debates in Detroit also only touch on climate\u2014and will be accompanied by thousands of activists, Sunrisers included, demonstrating outside.)", "At the end of the debate Prakash looks up from her laptop, eyes blazing. \u201cThe folks in D.C. have just decided they are going to sleep out another night,\u201d she announces to cheers and snaps. \u201cBecause fuck this bullshit! Nine minutes for the greatest existential threat to our existence? I\u2019m pretty enraged!
