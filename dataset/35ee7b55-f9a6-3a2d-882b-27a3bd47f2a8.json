For many, it is our power, our armor. Ask Nancy Pelosi. Ask the owner of the straw-colored three-step comb-over we see all too often. Hair is everything. It is the most defining feature we have, and we have the ability to change it as we change. Shouldn\u2019t it telegraph not only who we are but who we are becoming?", "\u201cPeople always mark chapters in their life according to haircuts. Breakups, jobs\u2014you can really chart a timeline through your hairstyles,\u201d muses George Northwood, the London stylist who caters to fashion royalty (and actual royalty) at his Fitzrovia salon. \u201cI think people want to come out of this changed, and hair sends a message on a daily basis of who you are.

With Zoom and FaceTime, it\u2019s a very neck-up silhouette right now,\u201d he explains. If we\u2019re not dressing up in as many new clothes, at least we can dress up in new hair. \u201cNormally I\u2019m the one pushing for change,\u201d adds Javier. \u201cNow there isn\u2019t much of a push.\u201d", "The same is holding true across the Atlantic.
