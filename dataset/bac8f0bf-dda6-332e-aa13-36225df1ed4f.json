Polls show his party\u2019s support has risen from about 15% to 25% since March. Not so for his sovereign, King Willem-Alexander. In April 76% of Dutch said they trusted the king; in December that had dropped to 47%, according to Ipsos, a pollster. Support for the monarchy as a whole fell from 74% to 60%. The main cause seems to be two disastrous holidays. In August Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima were photographed breaking social-distancing rules in Greece. In October the family returned there during the Dutch autumn break, even as the Netherlands headed towards a lockdown. The trip was cut short by public outrage.", "The House of Orange has been one of Europe\u2019s most popular royal families. Its history is unusual. When the Netherlands won independence from Habsburg Spain in the late 1500s, it started out as a republic.

They won kudos in the second world war, since Queen Wilhelmina fled to London rather than accept Nazi occupation. Though Willem-Alexander signs all laws, his main job is to meet business groups and charities and to give an annual speech (written by the government). Like other modern royals, they appeal to the people by mixing pomp and folksiness.", "This year\u2019s shenanigans upset that balance. The royals disregarded covid-19 rules while flaunting their wealth: the king brought along his new yacht worth \u20ac2m ($2.5m). \u201cThe Netherlands has a culture of \u2018Stick your head up and get mowed down\u2019, so the Oranges usually try to seem normal,\u201d says Kysia Hekster of NOS , the national news broadcaster. The royals cost the state \u20ac46m a year for salaries, events, palace upkeep and so on. But their private fortune is secret. The Oranges are still well liked, but many Dutch think they have a right to know what is beneath the peel. \u25a0", "Correction (January 10th 2021): A previous version of this article stated that Queen Juliana fled to London during the second world war."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["etiquette", "dutch", "netherlands", "queen", "royals", "king", "oranges", "bruised", "won", "covid19", "botching", "willemalexander", "world", "war"], "pubDate": "2021-01-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
