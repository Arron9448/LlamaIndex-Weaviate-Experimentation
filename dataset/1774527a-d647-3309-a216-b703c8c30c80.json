With such a diverse population, it's no wonder the selection of street eats changes with every turn.", "So if you're wondering whether or not you can eat the street food in India and avoid the aptly named \"Delhi belly,\" the answer is a resounding \"yes\" -- there's (almost) nothing to fear.", "Before you tuck into some chaat, however, read our guide on the do's and don't's of Indian street food to keep tummy troubles at bay.", "Related content Best Delhi attractions: A delightful dozen for your holiday in India", "Do: Anything fried or roasted", "In Hyderabad, streetside vendors prepare masala dosa -- a fermented crepe that's a popular breakfast option. NOAH SEELAM/AFP/AFP/Getty Images", "Samosas, aloo tikkis (fried potato cutlets), dosas, jalebis (sugar-soaked funnel cakes) and freshly roasted nuts are all safe bets.", "Why? Because they've been cooked in hot oil or were slow roasted to kill all bacteria.", "Other safe bets include toasted Bombay sandwiches, roasted corn (bhutta), pakoras, and vegetable puffs -- cooked veggies in puff pastry.", "Also important to note, it's commonplace in India to half-cook or half-fry fast food items and then finish fully frying them before sale so they'll be nice and warm.", "Don't: Yogurt-based dishes, especially during monsoon", "Yogurt spoils easily in the heat.", "And if it's being served by a street vendor under an umbrella, chances are it's floating in a large tub with murky water and melted ice.", "Add monsoon humidity levels into the mix and you've a recipe for disease, too.", "This also means avoiding yogurt-based dishes, like dahi puri.", "If you've just got to try some, opt for chain fast food restaurants, like Haldirams or Bikanerwala, to feed your curiosity.", "Do: Check the water source", "It's a well-known fact that water in India is best consumed from a packaged bottle, yet most guidebooks and locals alike will tell you that gol guppas or pani puris -- crispy, hollow rounds filled with spiced water -- are a must-try. And they are.", "The problem here is, often times, you don't know where the vendor gets their water from.", "If you can find a vendor who uses packaged water to make their spiced water, go ahead. If not, opt for a well-known establishment that specializes in fast food.
