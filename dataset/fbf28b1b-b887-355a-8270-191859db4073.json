It doesn\u2019t hurt that she is one of the chicest women I\u2019ve ever met and I idolize her personal style as much as I do her work for both Vogue and our planet. With Tonne\u2019s book, Point of View, coming out last year, we thought a joyful way to talk about the future of fashion would be to look back at some of Tonne\u2019s greatest shoots for Vogue and breathe new life into the looks by shopping them out from sustainable brands. This is a celebration of timelessness\u2014good style is forever as are great wardrobe basics\u2014and we already know Tonne\u2019s edit will stand the test of time.", "Then:", "Tonne and I are looking through Vogue\u2019s April 2016 issue when we pause on a page featuring Joan Smalls in a Smart Home tricked out with all the latest gadgets. \u201cThere was a great deal of fun conjuring up what the Smart House would include\u2014the new refrigerator that tells you when you are out of milk, the robot that plays with the kids. We actually had a drone car at one point,\u201d Tonne says. I tell her I\u2019m not really sure what a drone car is. As we flip through this shoot titled \u201cTomorrowland,\u201d which also features two adorable children and actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, we are drawn to the image of Joan in the kitchen with the aforementioned fridge. The caption for the photograph reads: \u201cLoungewear or postmodern formalwear?\u201d I tell Tonne that she didn\u2019t only find a robot for all of our at-home needs for the foreseeable future, but that, through her styling, she also managed to predict our current world and the way we\u2019re dressing in it.", "Now:", "Refocusing our forward-looking fashion lens for 2021, we\u2019ve reoutfitted this glam-meets-cozy look with the best sustainable choices, from the perfect loungewear pieces to upgraded kitchen systems.", "Summersalt The Cloud 9 pajama set $95 SUMMERSALT Shop Now Zyne Tulum $290 ZYNE Shop Now", "Pajamas made for day and night in graphic black and white will always top our list of at-home heroes.
