But, all too often, celebrations of paleogenomics overshadow the ethical considerations of field work. The sprint to study DNA extracted from human remains has been described by some as a reckless \u201cbone rush,\u201d or \u201cvampire science\u201d; research on genomes from across the globe, including such places as South Africa and New Caledonia, has raised questions about how to examine human origins without the participation of those whose history is under the microscope. Local communities do not seem to object to scientific work at the Himalayan lake, but a lack of criticism is not always consent. Given that paleogenomics investigates the heritage of millions of people, and disturbs the remains of those who cannot speak for themselves, we must work toward an ethical paradigm that includes explicit collaboration.", "Chip Colwell", "Editor-in-chief, Sapiens", "Denver, Colo.", "Preston explores the history of humanity in the Himalayas without mentioning the role of caste in South Asia. An increasingly influential corner of Indian society is using studies that track migration into South Asia to assert an Aryan identity and mark themselves as superior to others, in terms of both religion and caste. Questions about human history in South Asia are entangled with the politics of who belongs in Narendra Modi\u2019s India. Although this isn\u2019t directly at issue in Preston\u2019s article, readers of The New Yorker should know the stakes involved when it comes to the interpretation of genetic studies like the one he describes.", "Akanksha Awal", "Fellow in Social Anthropology", "University of Oxford", "Oxford, England", "The Origins of \u201clolita\u201d", "Ian Frazier, in writing about his personal history with Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s \u201cLolita,\u201d does not mention Sarah Weinman\u2019s 2018 book, \u201cThe Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel That Scandalized the World\u201d (\u201cRereading \u2018Lolita,\u2019 \u201d December 14th). Weinman reported a number of details about the story on which Nabokov may have based his novel. In 1948, Horner, who was then eleven years old, was abducted and sexually assaulted. Two years after she was rescued, she died in a car accident. It may still be defensible to view \u201cLolita\u201d as a work of isolated literary creation, but it is becoming less socially acceptable to view the rape of a child metaphorically. In discussing the evolution of his understanding of the novel, Frazier passes over the book\u2019s basis in reality.", "Jessica Johnson", "Toronto, Ont.", "Frazier points out that \u201cLolita\u201d contains no explicit references to Russian places or literature, and has very little Russian character at all. Even so, the book can be read as a satirical response to Dostoyevsky, whom Nabokov, a displaced liberal aristocrat, detested. As in \u201cCrime and Punishment,\u201d the protagonist in \u201cLolita\u201d is a criminal-as-victim, and pedophilia is a major theme in both novels. Humbert may be seen as an embodiment of Svidrigailov, the child-abusing aristocrat who mockingly embraces Raskolnikov as a kindred spirit. Nabokov also situates Lolita\u2019s death in Alaska\u2014which is a hop, skip, and a jump from Siberia, where Raskolnikov served his sentence.", "Andy Leader", "North Middlesex, Vt.", "\u2022", "Letters should be sent with the writer\u2019s name, address, and daytime phone number via e-mail to themail@newyorker.com.
