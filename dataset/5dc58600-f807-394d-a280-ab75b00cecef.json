The first floor was originally a doctor\u2019s home, while the ground floor was divided into several shops, their glass facades facing the wide, tree-lined street. After the second world war, it served as a meeting place for the city\u2019s Japanese community; then, from the 1960s, Lisbon diners flocked to its marble entrance when it became a fashionable restaurant. By the 1990s a financial company had put paid to that, redecorating the rooms in global-business beige.", "Ten years ago, Ant\u00f3nio Falc\u00e3o Costa Lopes and his brother Alexandre moved the Lisbon outpost of their architecture firm here (their main office is in Angola) and the building\u2019s fortunes took an upward turn. It is still owned by the family who had it built in the early 1900s, but under the Costa Lopes\u2019 expert eye, various repairs were gently suggested and carried out and the building began to regain a cohesive character.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Filipa and Ant\u00f3nio in reception against the Jupiter 10 wallpaper.", "Photograph: Rachel Smith", "\u201cBasically, whatever Ant\u00f3nio asked to do, the owner said yes because he knew the property was in good hands,\u201d says Filipa Fortunato. Filipa is Ant\u00f3nio\u2019s wife and also trained as an architect before opting to work in education. In 2016, the brothers decided to relocate their office across town \u2013 but Ant\u00f3nio and Filipa didn\u2019t want to give up the building.", "\u201cWe had talked about opening a hotel for a while, but as something to do once our children had left home,\u201d Filipa explains. \u201cBut this place was too incredible to let go. We gave up our old Lisbon home and moved in.\u201d", "The couple and their children, J\u00falia, 17, Jaquim, 15, Merc\u00eas, 12, and Sofia, five, now all live \u201cabove the shop\u201d at Casa Fortunato. There are nine guest suites and the family\u2019s bedrooms are on a newly converted attic floor, where the style is more minimalist, taking its cue from the black beams, white walls and big views of the sky. But they spend plenty of time downstairs, sharing their living spaces with hotel guests.", "There is a library, which is a good place for doing homework. The reception area, with its mirror-glass coffee table, Jean Prouv\u00e9 desks and Zanotti sofa, is where friends drop by for coffee and a chat. And the hub of the house is the living room. Cacau, the family\u2019s languorous labrador, likes to hang out there, keeping a watchful eye on all the comings and goings. At weekends, the family has breakfast downstairs at the long, gleaming rosewood table. Sofia, their youngest daughter, arrives first and heads for the homemade chocolate spread and pancakes; Julia and Jaquim emerge later, operating on teenage time. For the family this isn\u2019t just about having the pick of the breakfast bar. \u201cThe idea is that we are sharing our food, along with our style and knowledge of the city,\u201d says Filipa. The menu at Casa Fortunato is macrobiotic, but there is no evangelising. \u201cWe explain it in advance, so no one turns up expecting eggs, bacon and hash browns,\u201d says Ant\u00f3nio.", "Hotel owners living on site is not a revolutionary idea. But the model at Casa Fortunato is a far cry from old-school B&Bs with their curfews and creaky stairs, or Airbnbs, where half-finished bottles of shampoo and family photos linger to remind you that you\u2019re just renting a bed.", "At Casa Fortunato, it\u2019s a completely different hospitality game, the sense of this being home-from-home stemming from how the rooms have been put together. Almost all the furniture (bar the beds and baths) already belonged to Filipa and Ant\u00f3nio, either from their previous Lisbon home or from storage, waiting for their hotel pipe-dream.", "The couple have collected art and furniture since they first met as architecture students and can tell you the story behind every piece. A pair of groovy 1960s orange table lamps was passed on by Ant\u00f3nio\u2019s grandmother; the Saarinen Tulip table was bought when they first lived together, as was the Patricia Urquiola sofa. Ant\u00f3nio spotted the huge red sofa in a local antiques shop \u2013 it had belonged to Lucien Donnat, a theatrical and interior designer who worked on Lisbon\u2019s Ritz hotel in 1959. The enormous Jos\u00e9 Pedro Croft artwork above it was bought at auction on the same day they went to a memorable Seal concert.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest In guest rooms, the archways and glazing have been preserved. Wallpaper by Jupiter 10. Photograph: Rachel Smith", "In the bedrooms, the furniture has similar stories and connections. Several desks are from Filipa\u2019s father\u2019s offices and a low-slung leather and chrome chair belonged to her grandmother: \u201cAs a child, I would slide down in it and almost disappear,\u201d she remembers. Rugs were bought on family trips to Morocco and Istanbul. The lighting \u2013 all chosen by Ant\u00f3nio \u2013 errs towards contemporary classics by Flos, Foscarini, Noguchi and Jaime Hayon.", "Only one item was a slight wrench to share \u2013 the Fat sofa by Patricia Urquiola for B&B Italia in room number six. \u201cIn our old home it sat in a spot bathed in sunlight and we\u2019d spent hours sitting on it and talking, so it has lots of good memories. But I\u2019m sharing nicely,\u201d Filipa smiles.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cacau the labrador lies under a Jean Prouv\u00e9 desk; pendant from local vintage shop. Photograph: Rachel Smith photography", "This mix of old and new reflects the way that homes, rather than hotels, tend to come together. \u201cWe aimed to put in pieces that could have been here at different times in the house\u2019s history,\u201d says Ant\u00f3nio. At the modern end of the spectrum, he chose wallpapers by Jupiter 10, with dazzling geometric shapes in burned oranges, deep blues and earthy greens. In some rooms, these op-art patterns are set inside the house\u2019s original wall panels. \u201cWe wanted to keep the architecture intact, but draw attention to it,\u201d he adds.", "Pattern also comes from the ceramic floor tiles. \u201cI tracked down a small traditional tile factory in Alentejo and then discovered the owner\u2019s father had sold tiles to my grandfather, when he ran a construction firm in Angola,\u201d says Ant\u00f3nio. \u201cWe love the idea of the two families working together again.\u201d", "Ant\u00f3nio was born in Angola but was evacuated to Portugal when civil war broke out in 1975. He and his brother returned to base their architecture practice in the capital, Luanda. Ant\u00f3nio is acutely aware of the role that architecture can play in building national identity: \u201cThe project we\u2019re most proud of is redesigning the waterfront in Luanda,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter so many years of civil war, it felt like a great achievement to make it a space everyone could enjoy and feel ownership of.\u201d", "Whether in Lisbon or Luanda, Ant\u00f3nio believes in the power of good design to improve urban life. \u201cWith architecture, you can change things that are broken. The landscape that people grow up seeing is what shapes them. At its best, architecture is a chance to improve those views and those memories.\u201d", "Casa Fortunato won Mr & Mrs Smith hotel of the year 2019.
