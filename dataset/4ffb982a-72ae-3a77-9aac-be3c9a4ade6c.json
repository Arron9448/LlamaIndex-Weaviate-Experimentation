The resulting steam explosion at the plant near the city of Pripyat, 70 miles north of Kiev, spewed out so much radiation that much of the surrounding area will be uninhabitable for 20,000 years. Harmful isotopes were carried by the winds as far as Ireland within a week. According to some accounts, first responders who were exposed to large doses of radiation suffered agonising deaths. These events, as well as the political intrigue of the Soviet government\u2019s actions, are the subject of HBO\u2019s historical drama series, \u201cChernobyl\u201d. Following the final episode, which aired in America on June 3rd, it is the highest-rated television series of all time, according to crowd-sourced reviews on IMDb, a film and television rating site.", "Reviewers have given the miniseries stellar ratings. A weighted average of all five episodes calculated by The Economist (according to how recently each episode ran and the number of reviews) accords it 9.7 points out of 10. By the same measure, other leading shows\u2014including comparable historical drama series such as \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d (now called \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d)\u2014lag behind.", "What is more, every episode of \u201cChernobyl\u201d has been rated by IMDb users at 9.5 or higher, a unique streak. According to The Economist\u2019s analysis of 518 episodes of popular television dramas, the likelihood that any show would produce even four consecutive episodes that each score a 9.5 or above is roughly 0.4%. Apart from \u201cChernobyl\u201d, only the final four episodes of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d\u2014previously the highest-rated show\u2014had accomplished this feat.", "All of this is even more impressive given its subject matter. Documentaries typically struggle to gain as much attention as action and fantasy shows such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, and the same is true of historical dramas. Even series about well-known subjects, such as Queen Elizabeth II or the trial of O.J. Simpson, earn user ratings that are typically below those of the most popular shows. In comparison, \u201cChernobyl\u201d scores better than the greats.", "The show has also caused a massive spike in interest about the actual disaster. Web traffic to the entry for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, has increased 56-fold since the start of the year. Interest in a comparable nuclear disaster at Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 has also increased, though by a more modest 21 times.", "Editor\u2019s note (June 4th 2019): This piece was originally published on June 3rd and has been updated following the airing of the final episode in America.
