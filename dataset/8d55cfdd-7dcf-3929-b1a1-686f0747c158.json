Whether you\u2019re an old-school platforming fan or a young\u2018un who has maybe heard the name \u201cAlex Kidd\u201d uttered in some gaming circles, you\u2019ll have a chance to experience his original adventure under a modern lens.", "Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX launches June 24 and gives the 1986 Sega Master System classic a big facelift. For one, it looks a lot shaper thanks to the redesigned visuals and animations. If you find yourself pining for the old look, though, you can switch to the original graphics (or at least a recreation of them) with the press of a button. Platforming and combat have also been tweaked for improved playability. Take a look at the improvements yourself by watching the release date trailer below.", "DX features every level from Miracle World but also introduces some brand new areas as well. There\u2019s also a roster of new bosses to take down. If punching their lights on during the main game isn\u2019t enough, you can take them on all over again in a new Boss Rush mode. Finally, the soundtrack features rearranged music tracks as well as remastered versions of the original score.", "The best news, though, is that you can still play jan-ken-pon (rock, paper, scissors)!", "Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For a refresher on the original game, watch the old GI crew revisit it in this 2012 episode of Replay.", "Any old-school Alex Kidd fans looking forward to revisiting the often forgotten mascot in Miracle World DX?
