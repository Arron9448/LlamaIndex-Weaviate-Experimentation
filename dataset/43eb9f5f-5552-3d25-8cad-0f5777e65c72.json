A police officer shot and seriously injured a man who resisted arrest for a misdemeanor of illegal fishing. Did the officer commit the crime of assault? I\u2019ve long thought that the force that police may use in making an arrest reveals one of the most basic facts about our society: that the state has power to inflict violence on us in certain circumstances, in the name of enforcing law. We consider it justified for police officers, unlike ordinary citizens, to inflict violence on individuals\u2014with fists, batons, pepper spray, tasers, guns\u2014up to the point of death, so long as the officer embodies valid legal authority and the amount of force is proportionate to what is needed to get the individual to submit to that authority. So, when police actions result in a person\u2019s death, it is not necessarily a criminal homicide; that depends on whether the police are found to have used an excess of force.", "The killing of George Floyd, in May, 2020, set off worldwide protests of the deadly and pervasive subordination of Black Americans by the police. The homicide trial of the officer accused of killing Floyd, Derek Chauvin, which began in Minneapolis on March 29th, is focussed on a more discrete question. In the course of arresting Floyd, on the suspicion of his using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill, Chauvin kneeled on his neck for about nine minutes as he gasped for breath. The jury will consider whether Chauvin\u2019s use of force exceeded what was necessary to make the arrest, constituting murder or manslaughter. The prosecution is arguing that, as the attorney Jerry Blackwell put it, in his opening statement, Chauvin \u201cbetrayed this badge when he used excessive and unreasonable force upon the body of Mr. George Floyd, that he put his knees upon his neck and his back grinding and crushing him until the very breath\u2014no, ladies and gentlemen\u2014until the very life was squeezed out of him.\u201d", "None of the charges against Chauvin demand proof that he actually intended to kill Floyd. The most serious, second-degree murder, requires the prosecution to prove that Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck was a felony assault that caused Floyd\u2019s death. A lesser charge, third-degree murder, requires proof that the act caused Floyd\u2019s death and was \u201ceminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\u201d The least serious of the charges, second-degree manslaughter, requires proof that Chauvin displayed \u201cculpable negligence,\u201d creating an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took \u201cchances of causing death or great bodily harm.\u201d", "No reasonable person viewing the video of Floyd\u2019s death could conclude that the force that Chauvin used was necessary. Floyd was handcuffed and lying facedown on the pavement during the agonizingly long period that Chauvin\u2019s knee was on his neck. Nevertheless, the prosecution has devoted multiple trial days to establishing that Chauvin\u2019s act was excessive. Multiple police officers and experts have clearly and repeatedly said that the force Chauvin used was disproportionate to any possible physical danger that Floyd presented in the moment. Jody Stiger, a use-of-force expert in the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that, once Floyd was subdued, \u201cno force should have been used.\u201d A lieutenant in the Minneapolis Police Department, Richard Zimmerman, said that it was \u201ctotally unnecessary.\u201d The department\u2019s police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who fired Chauvin the day after Floyd\u2019s death and called his act a \u201cmurder,\u201d said at trial that Chauvin\u2019s maneuver \u201cin no way, shape, or form is anything that is by policy,\u201d and that it \u201cis not part of our training.\u201d In response, the defense asked questions suggesting that, even if Floyd, who\u2019d initially resisted arrest, appeared to have been adequately subdued, it was reasonable for an officer not to let up on the force for fear that the suspect could suddenly rise up again and pose a real danger. These suggestions were mostly rebuffed by the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, but they will be central to the defense case.", "Even if the prosecution succeeds in establishing that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was excessive and constituted assault, or evinced his \u201cdepraved mind\u201d or \u201cculpable negligence,\u201d any homicide conviction still requires proof that his actions actually caused Floyd\u2019s death. The Hennepin County medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report found that Floyd\u2019s heart and lungs stopped while Chauvin\u2019s knee was on his neck, and that his death was a homicide. The report also found that Floyd had heart disease and drugs in his system. The fact that Floyd had used drugs, which may have been a contributing factor in his death, is not necessarily a problem for the prosecution\u2014it does not need to prove that Chauvin\u2019s act was the only cause. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist, gave expert testimony that the compression of Floyd\u2019s body, while his hands were pulled behind his back in handcuffs, caused his death \u201cfrom a low level of oxygen.\u201d Tobin also concluded that any drugs in his system did not affect his breathing, and that \u201ca healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died.\u201d", "The defense\u2019s best possibility of avoiding conviction is to introduce doubt about the cause of death\u2014in particular, about whether Floyd would have died had he not had drugs in his system. The defense attorney Eric Nelson argued, in his opening statement, that Floyd \u201cdied of a cardiac arrhythmia that occurred as a result of hypertension, his coronary disease, the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and the adrenaline flowing through his body.\u201d If Nelson manages to inspire doubt about the cause of death in the mind of just one person on the jury, then it will be unable to find Chauvin guilty of any of the charges against him. As the defense presents its case, in the coming days, I would expect it to feature a barrage of technical information on the effect of the drugs in Floyd\u2019s body, which will aim not so much to persuade as to confuse jurors, shaking their confidence that the cause of death was asphyxiation by Chauvin\u2019s knee. This may not be easy to do. The application of the legal concept of causation to medical evidence can be made technical or complicated, but my observation has been that jury conclusions on causation most often track with moral intuitions about responsibility.", "In his opening statement, Nelson said, to the jury, \u201cI suggest that you let common sense and reason guide you.\u201d Yet it is clear that, in order to prevail, the defense needs jurors to break with common sense and intuition\u2014manifested in the visceral reaction around the world to the video of the killing\u2014and instead focus on the component parts of the case and alienate those parts from the meaning of the event as much as possible. In the courtroom, the jurors have been told by the defense that what they plainly see in the video of the event breaks down under close scrutiny and means something different. This strategy worked in the trial of four L.A.P.D. officers who brutally beat Rodney King, in 1991, an event that was also captured on video. Three decades later, George Floyd, a Black man brutally killed by a white police officer in plain view, has been portrayed, at trial, as a body afflicted with disease and infused with life-threatening drugs. The process mimics the operations of law, which can sometimes threaten to displace justice by obscuring its broader meaning.", "\u201cThere is no political or social cause in this courtroom,\u201d the defense told the jury. It is true that the jurors\u2019 assigned task is neither to vindicate nor to denigrate the Black Lives Matter movement. Yet we know about the unrest that followed the killing of Floyd, and also the unrest that followed the failure to convict any of the officers involved in King\u2019s beating. We expect twelve ordinary citizens to somehow put those facts aside and focus on assembling the evidence in front of them into a story of how and why Floyd died and whether the accused is responsible. \u201cYou can believe your eyes,\u201d the prosecution said. \u201cIt\u2019s murder.\u201d That appeal to jurors\u2019 common sense comes up against the defense\u2019s suggestion that \u201ccommon sense tells you that there are always two sides to a story.\u201d But this is a case in which the political momentousness far exceeds its legal or factual difficulty."], "authors": ["Jeannie Suk Gersen", "Jeannie Suk Gerse", "Ian Frazie", "Michael Eric Dyso"], "keywords": ["floyds", "chauvin", "defense", "drugs", "death", "floyd", "facts", "chauvins", "force", "derek", "simple", "trial", "used", "officer"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
