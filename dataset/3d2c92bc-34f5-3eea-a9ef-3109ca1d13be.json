It has not turned out that way.", "Yet Hunter\u2019s book has been praised for its searing honesty and literary style and for challenging the stigma of addiction. As Republicans flail to find a line of attack against Biden that will stick, Hunter\u2019s self-revelations have been met by a shrug in a nation seemingly inured to scandal by Trump himself.", "\u201cIt is amazing how many of their hopes and dreams did centre on Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, Hunter Biden\u2019s sex life, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, and interesting for a political party that has based so much on \u2018nothing matters\u2019 to discover to their disappointment that nothing matters,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind.", "\u201cHaven\u2019t they sort of established a small universe where nothing matters? You can pay off a porn star and it doesn\u2019t make a difference. Did they really think that somehow Hunter Biden was going to make a difference?\u201d", "In the memoir, Beautiful Things, Hunter, 51, details a lifelong struggle with drink and drugs. He writes that his \u201cdeep descent\u201d into substance addiction followed the 2015 death of his older brother, Beau, who succumbed to brain cancer aged 46.", "Hunter admits that \u201cin the last five years alone, my two-decades-long marriage has dissolved, guns have been put in my face, and at one point I dropped clean off the grid, living in $59-a-night Super 8 motels off I-95 while scaring my family even more than myself\u201d.", "In an interview about the book on CBS, the president\u2019s son recalled going 13 days without sleep as he smoked crack and drank vodka. \u201cI spent more time on my hands and knees picking through rugs \u2013 smoking anything that even remotely resembled crack cocaine. I probably smoked more Parmesan cheese than anyone that you know.\u201d", "The Biden family staged an intervention at their home in Delaware in 2019, inviting two counselors from a rehab centre to dinner. Hunter swore and ran from the house but was chased down the driveway by his father, who \u201cgrabbed me, swung me around, and hugged me. He held me tight in the dark and cried for the longest time. Everybody was outside now.\u201d", "Hunter also uses the book to deny wrongdoing in joining the board of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine, where he earned more than $50,000 a month from 2014 to 2019. Republicans allege that he benefited from his family name when his father was vice-president. Hunter\u2019s tax affairs are currently under investigation by the justice department.", "Hunter Biden with his father at an event in Washington in 2016. Photograph: Teresa Kroeger/Getty Images", "The memoir has earned positive reviews. Publishers Weekly found that Hunter\u2019s \u201ccourageous self-assessment makes the despair of substance abuse devastatingly palpable\u201d.", "In a blurb on the book\u2019s jacket, author Stephen King describes it as \u201charrowing and compulsively readable\u201d with a bravery that is \u201cboth heartbreaking and quite gorgeous\u201d. He comments: \u201cHunter Biden proves again that anybody \u2013 even the son of a United States president \u2013 can take a ride on the pink horse down nightmare alley.\u201d", "And Dave Eggers, whose books include the memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, writes in another blurb: \u201cBeautiful Things is so concise, so unflinching and propulsive, that outside of turning the pages and occasionally picking my jaw off the ground, I didn\u2019t move between the first page and the last.\u201d", "None of this gives Republicans the ammunition they hoped for. Politically, the book has been a dog that didn\u2019t bark (unlike Biden\u2019s actual dogs, Champ and Major, which have made headlines over biting incidents and excrement in a White House hallway) and, instead of turning into a liability, only appears to reinforce Biden\u2019s image as compassionate and humane.", "Sykes, founder and editor-at-large of the Bulwark website, said: \u201cIt\u2019s also a story of a very loving and loyal father and it\u2019s hard to turn that into a negative. There are a lot of parents out there that know how dealing with a child who has problems is one of the greatest challenges you can face and so I think people are as likely to be empathetic as they are to see it as a negative.", "\u201cNot to mention the fact that in the context of Joe Biden losing two of his children and his first wife under tragic circumstances, it puts the Hunter Biden story in a very different light. I\u2019ve always thought it was deeply cynical that Trump wanted to exploit that as a weakness, to go after the one living son of a man who suffered through so much tragedy.\u201d", "Rightwing efforts to demonise Hunter have been further blunted by a crisis in their own ranks. The memoir played second fiddle to almost daily revelations about Matt Gaetz, a fiercely pro-Trump Republican congressman, reportedly under investigation over allegations of a relationship with an underage girl and payments for sex with women recruited online. Many observers find Gaetz a less sympathetic figure than Hunter.", "Biden, 78, is far from the first president to face scrutiny over his offspring\u2019s conduct. John Adams, the second president, once confessed: \u201cMy children give me more pain than all my enemies.\u201d Adams disowned his third son, Charles, an alcoholic who was destitute when he died at 30 from cirrhosis of the liver.", "I\u2019ve always thought it deeply cynical that Trump wanted to exploit it as a weakness Charlie Sykes", "Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, said: \u201cThroughout history there\u2019s been quite a bit of alcoholism and substance abuse in the sons of presidents but it\u2019s always been buried. The Republicans are operating from \u2018Oh, my gosh, we\u2019re going to reveal these secrets and we\u2019re going to show that this new president has this substance-abusing son and it\u2019s all horrible\u2019.", "\u201cBut Hunter Biden is breaking the mould by writing a really honest memoir. It\u2019s different from the 18th century where it would all be hidden. By being so honest and direct, he\u2019s taking away the political toxicity of his difficult life. It\u2019s a turning point in history where this material can no longer be weaponised. That seems to be the lesson.\u201d", "Hunter is helping demystify the lives of powerful politicians, Kendall added. \u201cWe\u2019re learning that just because you\u2019re rich and famous, substance abuse can still happen. We\u2019re much more tolerant of it.", "\u201cIf this had happened 50 years ago, it might be much more useful ammunition for Republicans but it\u2019s petering out because society has changed and we\u2019re much more used to the fact that presidents are real people. He did a thorough gut check and I think that\u2019s resonating with readers and might actually help other people with substance abuse.\u201d", "That view is shared by Gabor Mat\u00e9, a Canadian-based author and doctor who has studied links between addiction and trauma. He said: \u201cHunter\u2019s sharing of his own trauma, addiction and ongoing work towards recovery will benefit many. I acknowledge his courage in doing so. Whatever some short-sighted politicians may make of it, all of us in the medical and healing communities can only be grateful for his speaking out.\u201d"], "authors": ["David Smith"], "keywords": ["memoir", "biden", "bidens", "hunter", "son", "revelations", "republicans", "deflated", "shrugs", "addiction", "hunters", "scandal", "substance", "trump", "nation", "wasnt"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
