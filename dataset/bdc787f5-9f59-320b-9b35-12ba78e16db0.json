Do you have any memories of her?", "Julie Fudge: Most of the memories I have of Mom aren\u2019t the best. But at the same time, if I see a certain photograph, it just reinforces what I remember about her. When someone tells a certain story, I\u2019m suddenly there again. And somehow I remember it.

The snow was almost as deep as I was tall. I also remember being in Nevada when Mom played Las Vegas. There are times when a lot of those things seem like small memories that I could barely remember.

As a small child, I lived with my dad and my grandmother. I remember the music and I remember the music belonged to mom.", "That didn\u2019t seem unusual. It was just another perk of getting to hear her even though she wasn\u2019t here. I also had a pretty normal childhood. When mom passed away, she wasn\u2019t as well-known as she is today. It wasn\u2019t until \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d and then \u201cSweet Dreams\u201d came out that things started happening.

We just want to make sure it\u2019s done properly. Dad was very adamant about protecting mom\u2019s legacy and not just letting it become another commodity.", "Fox News: Are there any misconceptions that still exist about your mother?", "Fudge: Of course there are misconceptions here are there... But they tend to be small things. For example, \u201cSweet Dreams\u201d portrayed mom loving yellow roses. That\u2019s not a big problem, but the fact is she loved red roses.

But it had begun as a way to support her family and to help around the household. I think she missed not being able to be home and be a mom more.
