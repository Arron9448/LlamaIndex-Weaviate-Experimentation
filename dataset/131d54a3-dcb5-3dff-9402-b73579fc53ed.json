So the author and poet decided to renovate their garage into a cozy, inspirational office space. \u201cThis room is really funny and quirky,\u201d the New Orleans-born writer tells Vogue. The green-painted room is filled with trinkets like a special edition Maya Angelou Barbie doll, her friend Mia Moretti's book of poetry, vintage art, and her beloved pink typewriter\u2014which she used to write her book Heart Talk. \u201cEverything in here makes me smile, or puts me in a good mood.\u201d", "\u201cThis room literally looks like a crazy living room from right out of New Orleans or something.
