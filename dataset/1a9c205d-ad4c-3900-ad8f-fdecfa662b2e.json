Valencia released a statement in which they accused Cala of subjecting their player to racist abuse, and later said that they had chosen to continue without him because of the risk of having to forfeit the game and face further punishment.", "On Tuesday Dikhaby released a short video on Twitter in which he alleged that Cala had used the phrase \u201cnegro de mierda\u201d. In a pre-arranged press conference shortly after that Cala said he had not racially abused Diakhaby and threatened to take legal action against Valencia\u2019s president, Anil Murthy. He said that the only phrase he had used was \u201cleave me alone\u201d and that either Diakhaby had made it up or he had misunderstood what was said.", "La Liga\u2019s initial investigation concluded that there was no evidence that Cala used racist language. \u201cThe available audiovisual and digital files have been examined: the audio from the game, the images broadcast and what has appeared on social media have been analysed,\u201d a statement from the league said. \u201cTo complement the report we have employed a specialist company to carry out a lip-reading analysis of the conversations and to study the behaviour of Juan Torres Ruiz [Juan Cala] and Mouctar Diakhaby.", "\u201cAfter an analysis of the material, the conclusion has been reached that in none of the material available to the league is there any proof that Juan Torres Ruiz insulted Mouctar Dikhaby in the terms alleged.", "\u201cLa Liga has passed these reports on to the clubs involved and the relevant authorities so that they can form part of those ongoing investigations.\u201d", "Valencia said in a statement: \u201cThe fact that no proof has been found does not mean that the matter did not occur \u2026 The club have by no means changed our opinion on what occurred in the game, and maintain our full support for Diakhaby. Our objective is to see a change and an appropriate reaction to such a serious incident, and to see moves to change regulations and attitudes.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "keywords": ["juan", "proof", "cala", "diakhaby", "league", "racially", "la", "used", "analysis", "game", "mouctar", "evidence", "abused", "statement", "finds", "liga"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
