Last Thursday, Pickles, the president of the West Palm Beach branch of the Proud Boys, described his experience of the uprising over the phone from Florida, where he runs a shop that sells T-shirts bearing such sayings as \u201cTrump 2020: Because Fuck You, Twice.\u201d", "At the age of forty, Pickles, whose real name is Piccirillo, is a bit old to call himself a \u201cboy.\u201d But, along with thousands of bearded and balding men in dad jeans, he headed to Washington to take part in what he called \u201ckind of a last hurrah for Trump, who put so much on the line for us.\u201d Asked whether he was among those who rampaged through the Capitol, Pickles said, \u201cNo comment.\u201d Then he noted, \u201cI\u2019d never been to the Capitol before\u2014and I have now!\u201d", "Before January 6th, he said, the Proud Boys, who are known for their misogynist, racist, and anti-Semitic views, had \u201cno organized plan\u201d that he knew of to storm the building. Pro-Trump chat groups had been ablaze with incendiary talk for weeks. But, he said, \u201cthe Proud Boys were just marching around the city before this started.\u201d As Trump addressed the rally, Pickles and his crew stopped for some halal chicken and rice. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really see the President, so we were listening on our phones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when we heard him say, \u2018Go to the Capitol,\u2019 we all were, like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a direct order, like a Mafia boss. But it was, like, \u2018Go to the Capitol\u2019!\u201d So directed, Pickles and his group began marching. Trump had made it sound as if he, too, planned to march to the Capitol to stop Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. Instead, he retreated to the safety of the White House.", "At the Capitol, the scene turned chaotic. \u201cIt happened in the moment. There was just so much momentum,\u201d Pickles recalled. \u201cWe felt compelled to storm the Capitol. There\u2019s nothing rational about it when you\u2019re caught up in something like that.\u201d He kept his phone\u2019s video camera on through the ensuing hours of occupation. \u201cI felt like a war correspondent,\u201d he said. (Pickles hosts a podcast.) \u201cWe were trying to smash the cops to get in,\u201d he added. \u201cThis old dude on top of a cranelike thing in the middle of a big stand, who had a bullhorn, was saying, \u2018Come forward! Come forward!\u2019 \u201d An older woman urged the rioters on, calling them \u201cpatriots.\u201d \u201cShe was funnelling people in through the windows,\u201d Pickles said. Nearby, \u201ca dude with tattoos all over his neck and face\u201d smashed glass.", "\u201cNo, I ordered the lifetime of doing whatever I want.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Will McPhail", "Pickles found the media\u2019s suggestions that police hadn\u2019t mounted a serious challenge insulting. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy!\u201d he said. \u201cWe were hit with pepper spray and tear gas. They were trying to keep people out. But we were rushing them.\u201d As if to demonstrate the group\u2019s valor, he exclaimed, \u201cSomeone got shot. And someone got hit with a pepper ball in the cheek! It left a big hole. And someone got hit in the eye.\u201d (This he found particularly scary, he said, because \u201cone of my grandfathers had a glass eye, and it\u2019s my biggest fear.\u201d)", "Pickles acknowledged the unfortunate optics of a group that claims to be devoted to law and order ransacking a federal building. \u201cI know it looks hypocritical on our end, because of the whole B.L.M. thing,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s slurs against Black Lives Matter protesters. \u201cBut if you seriously believe your country\u2019s getting taken over by fraud, you\u2019re going to get nuts.\u201d (Pickles can be seen online wearing a shirt saying \u201cKyle Rittenhouse Did Nothing Wrong,\u201d about the suspect in a double murder of B.L.M. protesters.)", "Pickles has a comfortable relationship with nihilism. He is happy to discuss his criminal record for grand theft (cashing a forged check) when he was eighteen, and his days as \u201ca juvenile delinquent.\u201d \u201cI grew up in the punk-rock scene,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump was like punk rock. It\u2019s, like, anti-establishment.\u201d He attended the University of Florida, where he was an English major and a liberal. \u201cI\u2019ve taken basket weaving and read about the Black prison experience,\u201d he said, with a snicker. (In his shop, Fat Enzo\u2019s, murals of Mark Twain and Hunter S. Thompson share wall space with Huey Long.) He explained that after his father died, in 2015, he sought out new male camaraderie. The Proud Boys filled a vacuum. He claims to have joined not because they are a hate group (as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center) but because \u201cthey were seeking something.\u201d He said, \u201cI came to the realization that Trump was awesome, and that I had been brainwashed.\u201d From right-wing podcasts and YouTube, he said, he has learned that \u201cthe pandemic is a scam,\u201d and that \u201cwe live in an inverted dictatorship run by the Deep State and globalists.\u201d", "Still, Pickles claims to be rattled by what happened at the Capitol. \u201cA lot of people were talking crazy stuff,\u201d he said. The mood among his fellow-insurrectionists was \u201cgetting to be a bit like that movie \u2018Casino,\u2019 where Joe Pesci plays Crazy Nicky. If you beat him with a fist, he\u2019ll come back with a knife. And if you beat him with a knife, he\u2019ll come back with a gun. And if you get him with a gun, you better kill him, because he\u2019s going to come back and kill you. It\u2019s kind of like that in Washington, D.C., now. Things are escalating. I hate to see what happens next.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Jane Mayer", "Jane Maye"], "keywords": ["group", "come", "boy", "proud", "capitol", "youre", "boys", "claims", "pickles", "putsch", "beach", "palm", "hit", "trump"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
