Not the Eton part, self-evidently \u2013 it is in that period, I assume, that he learned to recite, from memory and in Greek, the first 100 lines of the Iliad \u2013 but the Balliol classics part. I did that. We were taught by the same men (and men they were). \u201cEffortless superiority\u201d, a ghastly phrase once used by another Balliol prime minister, Herbert Asquith, was the college\u2019s unofficial motto, though there was nothing tranquil or effortless, still less superior, about my own panicky grapplings with Homer. (Women, I should note in passing, were admitted in 1979, 716 years after the first men.)", "Classical scholars turn backs on Boris Johnson over burqa comments Read more", "Some of the Balliol classics dons clearly adored Johnson\u2019s blustering undergraduate charm. \u201cDefinitely a good egg,\u201d is how the philosopher Jonathan Barnes, then famed for his wardrobe of 18th-century-style breeches and cravats, described him in Sonia Purnell\u2019s biography. Jasper Griffin, who taught us Homer, wrote a Greek ode for Johnson\u2019s 50th birthday.", "Some were less impressed. \u201cWhat had we done for Boris? Had we taught him truthfulness? No. Had we taught him wisdom? No. What had we taught? Was it only how to make witty and brilliant speeches?\u201d So the philosopher Anthony Kenny, master of Balliol in Johnson\u2019s day, reflected in a 2018 memoir. \u201cProbably the worst scholar Eton ever sent us \u2013 a buffoon and an idler,\u201d the ancient historian Oswyn Murray told me. (The wording chills me slightly, with its suggestion of a regular consignment of Eton scholars as if by a law of nature.) Last year Murray sent Johnson a formal renuntiatio amicitiae, a renunciation of friendship. It is what emperors sent to those they wanted to get rid of \u2013 \u201can invitation to exile or suicide\u201d, Murray explained.", "Johnson has drawn on the classics throughout his career. In his speech to the UN this September, he briefly dropped into ancient Greek: he was talking, somewhat bafflingly under the circumstances, about the suspicion often directed towards the protos heuretes (first inventor) of new technology. Who is Johnson\u2019s favourite politician? Pericles, of course, or so he told the radio station LBC this summer. Which historical figure did he reportedly reference after he removed the whip from 21 Tory MPs last month? The Roman emperor Augustus, who famously purged, bloodily, his former allies to establish his autocratic rule. That same Augustus whom, debating \u201cGreece v Rome\u201d with Mary Beard in 2016, Johnson called \u201ca chill and subtle tyrant\u201d who gouged out an opponent\u2019s eye with his thumb. \u201cWhat did the Romans do to democracy? They abolished it in favour of a dictatorship,\u201d he said. But on Radio 4 in 2010, he gushed: \u201cAugustus was the greatest politician the world has ever seen.\u201d Go figure.", "Play Video 1:12 Varadkar pledges to be Athena to Johnson's Hercules in apparent classical dig \u2013 video", "What is it about Johnson and this relentless classicism? On one level, he is a genuine enthusiast, or at least was. In 2006 he presented The Dream of Rome, a TV programme with an accompanying book that ends in a passionate plea for Turkey to enter the EU. In the relatively innocent era of 2007 he dressed up in a toga to protest against the threatened abolition of A-level ancient history. Later, as mayor of London, he bewildered aides by calling meetings to discuss how to revive classical studies in state schools (I attended one).", "Johnson\u2019s youthful, playful enthusiasm for classics has long petrified into cliche. It\u2019s not that classical references cannot add depth or strength or interest to an idea or an argument \u2013 but that Johnson\u2019s are flicks of show-offery, projections of superiority, mere flourishes that remind us that geeky Greekery is part of brand Boris. His cleaving to traditional learning serves to distract from his real cultural and political vandalism, as he slashes and burns his way through the conventions of parliament and the constitution, and coarsens and toughens his language in other ways. His references aim to exclude the uninitiated and mark him out as \u201cclever\u201d. But the truth is that \u201cthe classics\u201d carry disproportionate cultural capital. The merest suggestion of classical knowledge can disarm people into thinking you are far smarter than you really are.", "But \u201cthe classics\u201d are so much more than this careless and aggressive chucking around of Latin and Greek tags, as if they were bread rolls at a Bullingdon club dinner. Classics has a long tradition of questioning authority, and has had a fundamental role to play in the study of sexuality and feminism, among other areas. It has always been as much of an intellectual resource for the left as the right. (Karl Marx was a classicist, for heaven\u2019s sake; his doctorate on ancient Greek atomic theory was fundamental in developing his ideas on historical materialism.) There is also, in Britain, a long and much-overlooked history of working-class study of classics, which the scholars Edith Hall and Henry Stead are bringing to light.", "The real energy in the discipline is far removed from this ridiculous classical bluster, this game of trait-projection. The most interesting and challenging work about the Greco-Roman world \u2013 for instance by the members of a new group called the Postclassicisms Collective \u2013 is questioning and self-reflective about the subject\u2019s value and its boundaries, both geographical and temporal. It bumps up productively, sometimes crankily, against disciplines such as gender studies, art history, philosophy, archaeology, political theory and economics. It interrogates its own relationship to the power structures of the past and present, and increasingly understands that \u201cclassics\u201d cannot be seen in gleaming-white, superior isolation as a model for \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d, but alongside the classicism of Persian, Arabic and Chinese.", "Johnson\u2019s version of classics, like so much in his repertoire, is lazy and tired and utterly irrelevant.", "\u2022 Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian\u2019s chief culture writer"], "id": "fc33f439-f96d-3ebf-b95d-d89ebb768d3c", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/06/boris-johnson-classics-prime-minister-latin-greek"}
