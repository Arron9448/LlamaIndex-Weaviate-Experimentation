After threatening to pull out of the 2016 Yinchuan Biennale over its exclusion of Ai Weiwei's work, and turning down opportunities to exhibit in China over the dissident artist's treatment, Kapoor now says it is time to be \"part of the conversation.\"", "\"I understand your question about being politically outspoken -- about standing up, as I have done, against, if you like, oppression,\" he says during an interview at the CAFA Art Museum. \"I have to mediate (this) in relation to showing in China. And (I) take the view that culture has a voice, and a cultural conversation is a conversation about joining up, not one about separating.\"", "In \"Destierro,\" Kapoor transforms part of the CAFA Art Museum into a surreal red landscape.

Rather, he has always been more concerned with confronting dualities through his work -- bold, challenging creations that are at once smooth and textured, convex and concave, reflective and absorbent.", "These contrasts are widely explored in his Beijing retrospective. Bringing together some of his most celebrated sculptures and installations, it's a body of work that spans 35 years -- a time in which Kapoor has been knighted, won the coveted Turner Prize and represented the UK at the Venice Biennale.", "The most ambitious artworks are set across three floors of CAFA's on-campus museum.
