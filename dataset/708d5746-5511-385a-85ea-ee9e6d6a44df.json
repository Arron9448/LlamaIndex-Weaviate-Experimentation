Jesus was in his 30s when he rolled aside the stone from his tomb for Western culture\u2019s foundational did-you-miss-me? moment. Gloria Swanson was 51 when she inhabited the forgotten body of silent-film star Norma Desmond and vogued down the staircase in \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d. That\u2019s younger than Naomi Campbell is now.", "Why do some comebacks inspire and others appal? The best don\u2019t erase the absence that made them possible or ignore its attendant trauma. When Elvis returned to live touring in 1968, audiences went wild for his exertions as much as his voice, and snatched the sweat-damp towels he tossed in their direction. When Monica Seles returned to tennis two years after a man had stabbed her with a nine-inch knife during a game, the crowd cheered her physical and mental victory over her attacker.", "The Son of God fits this pattern too. Scourged, crucified, murdered, He returns in a shape fit for ascent to heaven. No more fieldwork, no more lecturing, no more miraculous catering, only the hereafter. And, we\u2019re assured, it\u2019s not just about Him. If we live the right kind of life, we get to do this too.", "When the band you loved as a teenager proves it can still fill a stadium, or an actor with whom you shared your youth comes back for a second act, it inspires and consoles. Comebacks suggest that the world is not, as some medieval scholars thought, a body in decay; that life isn\u2019t a process of loss or dilution governed by the second law of thermodynamics. We look at the flowers rising in the parks and gardens, and think ourselves green again.", "Grimm death Snow White", "In folklore, the alimentary tract is a zone of mystery. Girls, grandmothers and six little goats can be eaten by a wolf and then make a daring C -section exit, wholly undigested. The trachea of Snow White, though, offers the strangest case in \u201cCSI: Fairyland\u201d.", "Unlike the first two attempts on the heroine\u2019s life (the tight bodice laces and the poison comb), the apple is genuinely lethal. The magic mirror confirms it: the Wicked Queen is finally the fairest of them all. So how does Snow White return to life?", "The Disney version has her detoxified by the prince she met in the first reel of the picture. Deer, racoons and small human mineworkers gather round her corpse, the prince bends to kiss her and then suddenly she\u2019s yawning and stretching on her catafalque.", "In the Grimm Brothers\u2019 version, this is the couple\u2019s first meeting. A king\u2019s son, travelling through the countryside, spies a beautiful corpse in a glass coffin and negotiates with the dwarfs to take it home. As the prince\u2019s porters shoulder the coffin, a jolt pops the chunk of poisoned apple from her throat. Airways open, she is soon inhaling a marriage proposal.", "We\u2019re told she \u201cwas kind, and went with him\u201d. But perhaps revenge is the motive. Her wicked stepmother is on the wedding guest-list and the bride has more than canap\u00e9s prepared: \u201cThey had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.\u201d No magic here, just feudal torture.", "A wanted man Sherlock Holmes", "When Arthur Conan Doyle murdered Sherlock Holmes, it was a crime of passion. Why, he wondered, did the public not adore his novels about the Hundred Years War as they adored those little crime stories about portentous orange pips, snakes sliding down bell-pulls and cardboard boxes packed with salted human ears?", "Down went Sherlock, over the Reichenbach Falls, with Professor Moriarty as collateral damage. It took Doyle a decade to give in to the pressure from resurrectionist fans. In \u201cThe Adventure of the Empty House\u201d (1903), Holmes explained that he hadn\u2019t tumbled to his death through a column of Alpine spume after all, but disappeared to Montpellier to study coal-tar derivatives.", "The moral is: don\u2019t quibble with the reasons people love you. A hard lesson for Doyle. Hard, too, for the actors who played his hero. The greatest, Basil Rathbone, Hollywood\u2019s Holmes from 1939-46, grew to hate the calls on the street of \u201cwhere\u2019s Watson?\u201d But his wife, Ouida, had expensive tastes. In 1953 the couple produced their own Holmesian stage drama, which used spectacular scenery to restage the detective\u2019s watery death and rebirth. Holmes lived. Rathbone, unfortunately, was murdered by the critics.", "Never surrender Winston Churchill", "You wouldn\u2019t know it from his recent emergence as a fragile icon requiring state protection from the rough opinions of historians and Black Lives Matter protesters, but, during his lifetime, controversy attended Winston Churchill like cigar smoke and the black dog. In the 1930s he was regarded as a blimpish opportunist whose principal legacy was the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in the first world war, in which the Allies lost 45,000 men in the first month. (\u201cRemember the Dardanelles,\u201d taunted his opponents in the Commons.)", "In this context, the triumph of Churchill\u2019s wartime premiership is all the more remarkable \u2013 and the electorate\u2019s decision to dispense with his services in 1945 all the more comprehensible. (His insistence that Clement Attlee, the Labour politician who replaced him as prime minister, was mobilising his own version of the KGB was a reversion to old hyperbolic habits.)", "In 1951 he was back in Number 10, but the story of that second premiership is one of a sick man refusing to sign himself off work. His greatest comeback was posthumous. No other prime minister has occupied so much space in the cultural imagination for so long. He can take some of the credit: Churchill chose the site for his own statue. The main green of Parliament Square, the locus of British political anger.", "The great fall Deng Xiaoping", "Deng Xiaoping was present at the birth of Chinese communism: he also abolished it in all but name, dismantling actual communes, inviting Milton Friedman over for a brainstorming session and beginning China\u2019s transformation into the very model of a modern authoritarian turbo-capitalist state. He spoke of this change \u2013 in his peppery Sichuan dialect \u2013 as a series of somersaults. He\u2019d turned a few of those himself, as gyrations in the human pyramid of the Communist Party leadership forced him in and out of power.", "His first fall came during the Cultural Revolution, for which Deng was an enthusiast, despite being humiliated in \u201cstruggle sessions\u201d during which he had to criticise his own behaviour, being exiled to rural China to work the lathe in a tractor factory, and his younger brother\u2019s suicide after abuse by the Red Guards.", "Deng was rehabilitated in 1974, but after the death of Mao Zedong two years later, it turned out that the Gang of Four was plotting to make him jump again. (Their campaign had the snappy title \u201cCriticise Deng and Oppose the Rehabilitation of Right-Leaning Elements\u201d.) He endured almost a year of house arrest before the Gang themselves were purged, after which Deng was back in power. In January 1979 he normalised relations with America. But he\u2019d already toasted victory over his enemies. A deal with Coca-Cola had been struck in December: a symbol of his own Great Leap.", "Tell me more John Travolta", "John Travolta slid to stardom on a streak of Brylcreem, as Tony in \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d (1977) and Danny in \u201cGrease\u201d (1978). Then success slowly slipped away. Other forces, however, propelled him back to prominence in the mid-1990s, giving him the rest of that decade to fill the screen with his Lucifer smiles, befuddlement and compromised coolness.", "He was most celebrated in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994), but most perfectly cast in \u201cPrimary Colors\u201d (1998) as a skirt-chasing presidential candidate who is Bill Clinton in all but name. (Travolta\u2019s twinkle, and his imitation of Clinton\u2019s habit of gathering up the bottom of his face like an unruly hemline, seems to explain the durability of both actor and politician.)", "Travolta is a Scientologist. So perhaps the secret of his 1990s comeback lies buried in the New Mexico desert with the galactic wisdom of L. Ron Hubbard, engraved on stainless-steel tablets inside titanium capsules. Or perhaps there\u2019s a simpler explanation. If a generation of teenagers thinks that you\u2019re the epitome of cool, the ones that grow up into film-makers will want to pull you back into the orbit of the culture.", "Revival of the hippest The avocado", "Some experts think the avocado shouldn\u2019t be here at all. Its shiny cannonball seeds developed in an age when prehistoric megafauna swallowed them whole and excreted them over the Cenozoic verdure. Most of those monster sloths and mastodons vanished some 11,000 years ago. But still the avocado lingers \u2013 conquers, perhaps \u2013 despite its awkward nature.", "A Central American berry marketed as a pear, with an original name \u2013 ahuacatl \u2013 derived from the Aztec word for testicle, its progress has been slow and uneven. North America embraced it by the 1930s. (The dark, knobbly Hass variant was patented, though Californian farmers paid little notice.)", "In the 1970s Britain entertained it, first as a faintly boring starter from an era when half a grapefruit was an acceptable beginning to a sophisticated dinner party, and then briefly as a fashionable bathroom colour scheme.", "Today sanitaryware still keeps avocado at bay and it\u2019s no longer anyone\u2019s idea of a strong culinary opening number. But the avocado has done better. Reclassified as a superfood, claimed by Paltrovian wellness discourse, its oily body has colonised lunch, brunch and breakfast, defying Darwin to achieve what may be its ultimate evolutionary form. Hipster bacon.", "A reckoning Munroe Bergdorf", "What\u2019s the best revenge for being fired? Being rehired. Steve Jobs is the canonical example. Apple\u2019s board of directors squeezed out its founder in 1985, but computing\u2019s turtlenecked Messiah returned to save his old firm from bankruptcy in 1997. (It still seems to be in business.) A more glamorous version of the same story arc began in 2017 when Unite the Right marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, with their tiki torches and white-supremacist chanting, and Munroe Bergdorf, a mixed-race, transgender model from the Essex village of Stansted Mountfitchet, recorded her thoughts in a Facebook post.", "White people, she wrote, were \u201cthe most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\u201d. When the Daily Mail turned this into a news story, Bergdorf\u2019s employers, cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al, gave her the boot. She didn\u2019t apologise. Neither did they. Until 2020, when L\u2019Or\u00e9al issued a statement of support for Black Lives Matter, and Bergdorf pointed out the irony. \u201cYou...threw me to the wolves for speaking out about racism and white supremacy.\u201d", "Cue a long and emotional phone call with the brand\u2019s boss, a statement about systemic racism and Bergdorf\u2019s installation on L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s diversity and inclusion board. Why did they do it? Implicitly, because she\u2019s worth it.\u25a0", "Matthew Sweet is a regular contributor to 1843, and a writer and broadcaster in London"], "authors": ["Matthew Sweet"], "keywords": ["comebacks", "historys", "best", "version", "travolta", "death", "avocado", "went", "sherlock", "holmes", "turned", "john", "deng", "white", "jesus", "snow"], "pubDate": "2021-04-01T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
