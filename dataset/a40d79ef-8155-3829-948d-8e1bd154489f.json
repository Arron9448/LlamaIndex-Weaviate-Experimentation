The small yet vital piece of documentation serves as the only physical proof many now have that they\u2019ve been vaccinated against the novel virus, and a growing industry of post-vax creators are rushing to supply the market with holders to protect the cards.

Amazon alone has a multitude of choices, from a \"heavy-duty\" two-pack of clear vinyl plastic cases that come with a clip to a \"badge cardholder\"-style option or a case that comes in eight different color options, all of which cost under $10 each.", "What to do if you lose your vaccine card", "The fact that you received the vaccine is stored in larger databases, not only on that single piece of paper. If you lose it, the CDC recommends reaching out to the state health department or the pharmacy you received the shot at to see if they can print you a replacement record \u2014 but do not reach out to the CDC: It does not have vaccination record information.", "And soon, the paper record may be relevant only as a strange, physical token of the pandemic: Vaccine passports including New York State\u2019s Excelsior Pass allow residents to maintain an easily accessible digital record of their vaccine status, so they may gain entry to certain venues and businesses.", "What to know about digital vaccine cards", "CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE", "In addition to governmental vaccine passports, other private companies are launching their own digital vaccination certificates, including GoGetVax\u2019s VaxYes.", "The CDC has also created an app, called V-Safe, to serve as a post-vaccination health checker.
