As the particles ignite, they emit a garlic-like odor and melt everything in their path. Adam Driver, Marine lance corporal, 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, Weapons Company, 81st Platoon, was aware of these effects when he looked up at the California sky, during a drill exercise, one day in 2003, and saw a cloud of white phosphorus exploding above his head. The only thing to do was run. Driver had joined the Marine Corps the previous year, when he was eighteen. After high school, he\u2019d been renting a room in the back of his family\u2019s house, in Mishawaka, Indiana, and mowing the grass at a 4-H fairgrounds. He had vague ambitions of being an actor and had auditioned for Juilliard, in Manhattan, because he knew that it didn\u2019t check grades. When he was rejected, he decided to go to Los Angeles and try to make it in the movies. He packed up his 1990 Lincoln Town Car with his minifridge, his microwave, and everything else he owned, and said goodbye to his girlfriend. \u201cIt was a whole event,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cLike, \u2018I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll see each other again. Our love will find a way.\u2019 And then: \u2018Bon voyage, small town! Hollywood, here I come!\u2019 \u201d His car broke down outside Amarillo, Texas, and he spent nearly all his money fixing it. When he got to L.A., he stayed at a hostel for two nights and paid a real-estate agent to help him find an apartment (\u201cA total fucking scam\u201d). He walked around the beach in Santa Monica, calculated that the two hundred dollars he had left was enough for gas money, and drove back to Mishawaka, where he got his job with the 4-H back. He\u2019d been gone a week. \u201cIt was all just embarrassing,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like a fucking loser.\u201d After 9/11, he found himself filled with a desire for retribution, although he wasn\u2019t sure against what or whom. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t against Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was: We were attacked. I want to fight for my country against whoever that is.\u201d His stepfather, a Baptist minister, had given him a brochure for the Marines, which he\u2019d thrown in the trash. But now he reconsidered. He craved a physical challenge, and the marines were tough. \u201cThey kind of got me with their whole \u2018We don\u2019t give you signing bonuses. We\u2019re the hardest branch of the armed forces. You\u2019re not going to get all this cushy shit that the Navy or the Army gives you. It\u2019s going to be hard.\u2019 \u201d His decision to enlist was so abrupt that a military recruiter asked if he was running from the law. He was sent to a processing center in Indianapolis for a physical exam, then to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, for boot camp. The first night, the recruits lined up to get their heads shaved. A guy four spots ahead of Driver had a mole on his scalp which got shaved off, leaving him bleeding and screaming. Driver was six feet three and lanky, with squinty eyes, a beaky nose, and ears that stuck straight out. Another recruit, Martinez, also had big ears, and he and Driver were nicknamed Ears No. 1 and Ears No. 2. Basic training was as gruelling as it was in the movies. \u201cI was allowed one call, and my parents weren\u2019t home,\u201d Driver recalled, \u201cso I didn\u2019t talk to anybody for a long time.\u201d After two and a half months, he was sent to Camp Pendleton, in Southern California, where he trained as a mortarman. In one exercise, he and another trainee had to pound a nerve on each other\u2019s thigh until it was numb. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what the Marine Corps is like,\u201d Driver said. \u201cThey\u2019ll just keep hitting it until it\u2019s numb. Until you conform.\u201d During a simulated battle scenario, the mortarmen were to drive Humvees into a valley and fire mortars at a distant target, to be designated by a white-phosphorus explosion. In a screwup, the phosphorus exploded not over the target but over the men. Driver heard a boom overhead. Luckily, the wind was blowing, so the toxic plumes wafted a bit, and the marines sprinted to safety. Later, as Driver was collecting himself at the barracks, he thought about the two things that he really wanted to do in life, and he vowed to do them. One was to smoke cigarettes. The other was to be an actor.", "Driver, who is thirty-five, was telling me this story one morning in June, at an industrial-chic trattoria in Dumbo, over a lemon herbal tea. To help me picture the scene, he positioned a saltshaker to represent the target. His phone was the panicked mortarmen. A tattooed waiter came by for our order, and Driver, who lives nearby, in Brooklyn Heights, chose scrambled eggs with spinach. He said that he smoked cigarettes for a few years after the white-phosphorus incident but quit, more or less, in his twenties. The acting thing stuck. In 2012, he got his big break on HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls,\u201d playing Adam Sackler, a mysterious weirdo whom Lena Dunham\u2019s character, Hannah Horvath, visits for booty calls. The character, a peripheral one at first, became central. Adam Sackler was an odd specimen of boy: as big as a tree trunk yet affected in his tastes, particularly sexual ones. In one episode, he masturbates as Hannah berates him, demanding money for cab fare, pizza, and gum. It took seven episodes before he appeared outside his apartment. When Hannah spots him at a party in Bushwick and announces, \u201cThat\u2019s Adam,\u201d her friend Jessa deadpans, \u201cHe does sort of look like the original man.\u201d The same year, Driver had a small part in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln,\u201d as a telegraph operator. (He studied Morse code for the role.) I remember being jarred by his presence in the film: What\u2019s the pervy hipster from \u201cGirls\u201d doing in the nineteenth century? But Driver has a range and an intensity that have transformed him into one of Hollywood\u2019s most unconventional leading men. In just six years, he has worked with an astonishing roster of directors: Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch, Steven Soderbergh, the Coen brothers. Scorsese, who cast him as a seventeenth-century Jesuit priest, in \u201cSilence,\u201d told me that he was impressed by Driver\u2019s \u201cseriousness, his dedication, his understanding of what we were trying to do.\u201d When I asked Lee, who directed Driver last year in his Oscar-nominated performance in \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d why directors were drawn to him, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a very simple answer: game respects game.\u201d Cartoon by Edward Steed Driver has the bearing of a self-effacing vulture and a face like an Easter Island statue. (Not since Anjelica Huston has a movie star so embodied the concept of jolie laide.) Despite his stolid presence, his characters are often thwarted and befuddled\u2014high-strung alpha males driven by an ancient code of valor but tripped up by contemporary frustrations, like a Cro-Magnon man airdropped into Bed-Stuy and handed the wrong person\u2019s latte. Jarmusch, who cast Driver as a poetry-writing bus driver, in \u201cPaterson,\u201d and as a hapless police officer who fights zombies, in \u201cThe Dead Don\u2019t Die,\u201d pointed to his \u201cunusual usualness.\u201d Directors love his peculiar contradictions and his syncopated speech. (When the trailer for \u201cThe Dead Don\u2019t Die\u201d was released, in April, the Internet went briefly gaga over his elongated pronunciation of the word \u201cghouls.\u201d) \u201cHe\u2019s very disciplined, and yet he can be absolutely goofy,\u201d Terry Gilliam, who directed Driver in \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote,\u201d told me. Soderbergh cast him in the heist comedy \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d after seeing him on \u201cGirls.\u201d \u201cHe seemed to be operating with some different kind of compass,\u201d Soderbergh said. \u201cHis physicality, his speech rhythms were all unexpected and yet totally organic. You didn\u2019t feel like he was putting on a show or that it was mannered. He just seemed to be from another universe.\u201d In 2013, a column in Variety posited that Hollywood was suffering from a \u201cLeading Man Crisis.\u201d George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Will Smith were all middle-aged, and few younger actors seemed poised to take their place. But, six years later, there appears to be no shortage of leading men. Hollywood is awash in sad-eyed brooders (Ryan Gosling, Jake Gyllenhaal), muscled he-men (Channing Tatum, Dwayne Johnson), sophisticated gents (Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne), high-spirited underdogs (Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Reynolds), bug-eyed misfits (Rami Malek, Jared Leto), and the interchangeable hunks known as the Chrises: Evans, Hemsworth, Pine, and Pratt. Driver doesn\u2019t fit any of these molds. In some ways, he\u2019s a throwback to the off-center movie stars of the seventies\u2014Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson\u2014who blurred the line between matin\u00e9e idol and character actor and infused their roles with a sense of alienation and neurosis. Next month, he stars in two films, each as a man navigating a tortuous modern maze. In Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d he plays a theatre director whose divorce from an actress (played by Scarlett Johansson) turns into a nightmarish, yet totally ordinary, ordeal. In \u201cThe Report,\u201d directed by Scott Z. Burns, he plays the former Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones, who spent years investigating the C.I.A.\u2019s use of torture in the war on terror, only to be stymied by Washington bureaucracy. Soderbergh, who produced \u201cThe Report,\u201d told me, of Driver, \u201cHe just radiates obsession, and that is what \u2018The Report\u2019 needed above anything else: somebody that you believed would willingly lock himself in a room for five years to perform a task that may or may not end up being relevant or even known.\u201d Then there\u2019s the \u201cStar Wars\u201d reboot, in which Driver plays Kylo Ren, an interplanetary warlord who can\u2019t seem to live up to the infamy of his grandfather Darth Vader. During the course of the trilogy, which wraps up with \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d in December, Driver has managed to transpose the wounded virility of his twenty-first-century characters to the saga\u2019s galactic scale. (The comedian Josh Gondelman recently said that he empathized with Kylo Ren, \u201cthe only \u2018Star Wars\u2019 villain who can correctly rank all the best Death Cab for Cutie albums.\u201d) Kylo Ren is the J. Alfred Prufrock of space: a self-conscious poseur, needled by his own insecurities. J. J. Abrams, who cast Driver in the role, said, \u201cKylo Ren feels like he hasn\u2019t arrived. Even as he becomes supreme leader, he is wanting. It\u2019s like anyone you know who thinks that, when he arrives where he\u2019s going, he will feel fulfilled. For Kylo, the hole only gets bigger.\u201d Baumbach, who has directed Driver in four films, once heard him call acting a \u201cbenign rebellion.\u201d He told me, \u201cIt does accurately describe what he does so beautifully, because he\u2019s both serving the role and the story and the director, and at the same time always looking for other things and pushing back.\u201d Baumbach first cast Driver in a small role, in \u201cFrances Ha,\u201d as a hipster in a porkpie hat. One of his lines was: \u201cAmazing.\u201d \u201cThe way Adam says it is like a song: \u2018Ah-ma-zinnggg,\u2019 \u201d Baumbach said. \u201cI always think of that word that way now.\u201d", "When I asked Driver about \u201cbenign rebellion,\u201d he said, \u201cSometimes you have to shock yourself out of your rhythm.\u201d I first met him one evening this summer, in his dressing room at the Hudson Theatre, where he was starring in a Broadway revival of Lanford Wilson\u2019s 1987 drama \u201cBurn This.\u201d He was playing Pale, a boorish, coke-addled restaurant manager who bursts into the apartment of his late brother, Robbie, and begins an unlikely affair with the brother\u2019s dancer roommate, played by Keri Russell. \u201cThis supposedly was Ethel Barrymore\u2019s dressing room at some point,\u201d Driver said, wearing a Naval Base Coronado hat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t prove that.\u201d On the table was a poetry collection by Sharon Olds, which his wife, the actor Joanne Tucker, had given him as an opening-night gift. He showed me a few favorite lines, in which Olds envisages her parents as college students and yearns to stop them from making the mistake of their marriage, but relents: \u201cI want to live. I / take them up like the male and female / paper dolls and bang them together / at the hips, like chips of flint, as if to / strike sparks from them, I say, / Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.\u201d \u201cThe language is so great,\u201d Driver said, as he shovelled down a burrito bowl. \u201cStriking sparks between two things\u2014it\u2019s kind of similar to plays. That\u2019s it, right? You have an experience and then you go tell about it in your work.\u201d \u201cBurn This\u201d was more taxing than he had anticipated. Unlike with \u201cAngels in America,\u201d in which Driver appeared Off Broadway, in 2011, he couldn\u2019t let the language take him where he needed to go: \u201cIt\u2019s very much about everything that they\u2019re not talking about, which is the death of Robbie and the grief, you know?\u201d Driver is protective of his process and of the enigmas of acting, but he agreed to let me watch his preshow routine, of which the burrito bowl was the first step. When he finished eating, he went into the bathroom and put his head under a running faucet, while we talked about movies. \u201cHave you ever seen \u2018The Miracle Worker\u2019?\u201d he said mid-dunk. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene with Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke where they\u2019re just beating the hell out of each other. Fucking one of the best scenes in film. That\u2019s a non sequitur.\u201d He squirted gel into his hand and smeared it into his shaggy black hair. \u201cWith this play, I\u2019ve been really going to town on this shit. I think you\u2019re only supposed to use a handful, but I fucking plow this stuff on.\u201d As he blow-dried his hair, he talked about his taste for Danish-modern chairs; he and Tucker have a knockoff Hans Wegner, and he joked that if he weren\u2019t an actor he might have been a furniture-maker. He sat in front of a mirror and wound a bandage around his right hand. (When Pale first appears, he\u2019s been hurt in a bar fight.) \u201cThis bandage for some reason is the part that gives me the most anxiety,\u201d Driver said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trial and error over what is the right amount of blood. And the bandage cuts off circulation, so by the time I\u2019m done my fingers are purple.\u201d He drew a red trickle on his knuckle with a marker. Then he traced over it in brown. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fresh wound,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, an hour or two hours old.\u201d He stood up. \u201cNow I\u2019ll brush my teeth, because I have to kiss Keri,\u201d he said. On the couch was a piece of fan art he had received at the stage door. During \u201cGirls,\u201d strangers would often share details about their sex lives with him. (One guy stopped him in the subway and said, \u201cI love that scene where you pee on her in the shower,\u201d then turned to his girlfriend and said, fondly, \u201cI pee on her all the time.\u201d) But \u201cStar Wars\u201d has made him uncomfortably famous. \u201cThis one woman who has been harassing my wife came to the show and gave me a creepy wood carving that she made of my dog,\u201d he said. He and Tucker have a young son, whose birth they kept hidden from the press for two years, in what Driver called \u201ca military operation.\u201d Last fall, after Tucker\u2019s sister, who was launching a peacoat business, accidentally made her Instagram account public and someone noticed the back of his son\u2019s head in one picture, the news wound up on Page Six. Driver stretched his foot on a foam roller and lamented his loss of privacy. \u201cMy job is to be a spy\u2014to be in public and live life and have experience. But, when you feel like you\u2019re the focus, it\u2019s really hard to do that.\u201d He lay down on the roller and massaged his back; his body seemed to take up the entire room. His physique is sometimes regarded as a riddle of nature. When the play opened, the style blog The Cut convened four writers to discuss the question \u201cHow Big Is Adam Driver in Burn This?\u201d (\u201cI was so flustered by his quads that at one point I spilled all of the contents of my purse on the floor,\u201d one said.) After stretching, he boiled water for his throat-soothing \u201cpotion\u201d: half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and half a teaspoon of corn syrup. At seven-twenty, he raced downstairs to the stage, where the cast had gathered for their nightly fight call. Russell, who lives in Driver\u2019s neighborhood, was gossiping on the sofa about snotty Brooklyn preschools. They ran through their fight scenes, stomping and kicking and smacking at half speed, as if they were in a Three Stooges routine. Driver went back upstairs to shave and to gargle his potion. Because of Actors\u2019 Equity rules, I wasn\u2019t permitted to see the rest of his routine, but he told me what would happen next. When the play started, he listened on the speaker system until he heard his cue. As he headed to the stage, his dresser reminded him to put a prop watch in his pocket. He thought about the character of Robbie, his dead brother. Sometimes he would picture Robbie as the idea of \u201closing something beautiful.\u201d Or he would think about a mass shooting in the news. Or he would peek out at the silhouettes of the ushers in the theatre and view them as Robbie. Or he would think about the AIDS epidemic\u2014Robbie is gay but dies in a freak boating accident\u2014and project it onto the audience: \u201cMaybe they were all Robbies, and here I am facing them all. And they\u2019re faceless. All these artists who are gone.\u201d And then he tore through the apartment door onto the stage and delivered a ten-minute rant about parking and potholes and \u201cthis shit city\u201d\u2014Wilson wrote it in the throes of an anxiety attack\u2014as he thrashed around like a wild bird in a cage. \u201cSometimes everything I\u2019m thinking about helps,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut every once in a while it doesn\u2019t. And, the minute I get in my head, it\u2019s fucked.\u201d", "\u201cMarriage Story\u201d begins after the marriage in the title has ended. Charlie and Nicole, played by Driver and Johansson, are in a mediator\u2019s office, the air between them thick with resentment. The film is, in some ways, an update of \u201cKramer vs. Kramer,\u201d the 1979 drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep\u2014but while Streep\u2019s character disappears for most of the movie, allowing the audience\u2019s allegiance to drift toward Hoffman, \u201cMarriage Story\u201d toggles between the spouses, as if they\u2019d been granted joint custody of the story. At one point, when Nicole seems to be winning the battle over their young son, Charlie tells his lawyer, through tears, \u201cHe needs to know that I fought for him.\u201d Driver\u2019s parents divorced when he was seven. Until then, the family lived in San Diego, and Driver has happy memories of their life; every Friday, they\u2019d go to the beach and eat hot dogs. His father, Joe, was a Baptist youth counsellor, and his mother, Nancy, who met Joe at Bible college, played piano at church. After their split, Nancy moved Driver and his older sister to her home town of Mishawaka. He said, of \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d \u201cIt feels very familiar. Just trying to wrap your head around your parents not being together anymore\u2014and not only that but you\u2019re moving to the Midwest. Like, the first time seeing my father cry, as we\u2019re leaving. It\u2019s just all those very raw feelings that stick with you that you don\u2019t articulate.\u201d After the divorce, Driver\u2019s father left the church, and he now works at an Office Depot in Arkansas. While shooting \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d Driver said, \u201csomething I thought about all the time was the things that my dad didn\u2019t do that this guy does in Noah\u2019s movie. The fighting to get custody\u201d\u2014he took a long pause\u2014\u201cwas moving to me. My dad didn\u2019t do any of this. He didn\u2019t put up a fight.\u201d Mishawaka was a jolt. \u201cWe were living with my grandparents, and that sucked,\u201d Driver said. \u201cI mean, they were nice.\u201d His father had shown him grownup movies such as \u201cPredator\u201d and \u201cTotal Recall,\u201d but his new classmates talked about \u201cSaved by the Bell.\u201d Nancy got a job as a legal secretary in South Bend (she is now a paralegal) and reconnected with her high-school boyfriend, Rodney G. Wright, who drove a cab. With Nancy\u2019s encouragement, he became a Baptist preacher. He also became Driver\u2019s stepfather. Driver began to pick up on strange tensions in their religious community. At Twin City Baptist Church, the pastor refused to officiate at his mother\u2019s marriage ceremony, since she had been divorced. Around the same time, a girl in the Youth Department accused the pastor\u2019s wife of being a lesbian, an assertion that split the congregation and led to screaming matches that Driver struggled to comprehend. \u201cI remember this idiot yelling at my mom, saying, \u2018No wonder your husband left you!\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201cOnly recently did I realize, Oh, I hate organized things, because I feel like I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m being told it\u2019s one thing, but it\u2019s actually something else.\u201d The family soon joined another church nearby, where Driver\u2019s stepfather became the preacher. There wasn\u2019t much to do in Mishawaka, a blue-collar town that had been devastated by the demise of a Uniroyal plant. As teen-agers, Driver and his friends Noah and Aaron would climb radio towers or set things on fire. (\u201cLeaves. Clothes. Tires. Things like that, that you have to really douse,\u201d he said.) They would dumpster-dive behind a potato factory and feast on expired chips. They rented movies from P. J.\u2019s Video, down the street. \u201cBecause my parents were religious, we wouldn\u2019t watch any of these movies in the house,\u201d he recalled, so he would go to his friends\u2019 houses and binge on Scorsese and Jarmusch and \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d \u201cI started to form opinions on what was good and what was bad, through conversation with those guys.\u201d The first time he saw \u201cFight Club,\u201d he said, \u201cI felt kind of sick. It made me feel very strange. But then I watched it again almost immediately.\u201d In the woods behind a Kroger supermarket, the trio made camcorder movies. \u201cIt was, like, John Woo ripoffs, where we\u2019d take plastic guns and paint them black and wear long trenchcoats,\u201d Driver said. \u201cThey had no plots. They were just action movies.\u201d The friends also started their own fight club, in the field behind an event space called Celebrations Unlimited. The one rule was: \u201cDon\u2019t hit in the balls.\u201d Driver doesn\u2019t believe that he was expressing latent anger. \u201cI think it was something that scared me, getting hit, and the challenge in yourself to just turn the volume down on things.\u201d The club dissolved after neighbors called the cops. By then, Driver had developed an interest in stage acting. In his father\u2019s church, in San Diego, he played Pontius Pilate\u2019s water boy in an Easter cantata. In middle school, he auditioned for a play and didn\u2019t get cast, so he operated the curtain. Then he landed a one-line part in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d (The line was \u201cCheck his heart,\u201d spoken by a cowboy as Jud lay dying.) In his sophomore year, a new drama teacher cast him as a lead in \u201cArsenic and Old Lace.\u201d His teachers urged him to audition for Juilliard, so he drove to Chicago for regional tryouts. \u201cI didn\u2019t get in, I think, because I wanted to please,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no opinion about what I was saying.\u201d Cartoon by Roz Chast Instead, he bummed around Indiana, doing odd jobs. His stepfather had him wheel their lawnmower around to neighbors\u2019 houses and offer to mow their lawns, which he found humiliating. He made telemarketing calls for a basement-waterproofing company. He sold Kirby vacuums, or tried to\u2014he doesn\u2019t remember selling a single vacuum. At one point, he was driving around Chicago in the three-piece suit he wore for church, hawking stress balls and National Geographic videos about whales. \u201cI was basically peddling shit,\u201d he said. He convinced himself that he could use his acting skills to entice people. During one telemarketing call, he asked a woman if her husband was home. \u201cThere was a long pause, and she says, \u2018My husband\u2019s dead!\u2019 and started crying and hung up the phone. I felt terrible.\u201d Joining the Marines gave Driver a sense of purpose and some distance from his conservative religious upbringing. \u201cThe nice way of saying it is, it\u2019s not part of my life anymore,\u201d he said of the church, though he emphasized that he considers faith and religion to be two separate things. He is wary of discussing his parents or religion. In 2014, his stepfather told the South Bend Tribune, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything that he does, but I agree with his work ethic.\u201d His mother didn\u2019t know that he was on \u201cGirls\u201d until the second season, when she found out from a co-worker. The pull between faith and apostasy has interlaced his movie roles. In \u201cSilence,\u201d he based his character, Father Garupe, on St. Peter. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one that\u2019s questioning, and I find that is healthier,\u201d Driver said. \u201cDoubt is part of being committed to something, I think. They\u2019re very hand in hand, and that seemed more human to me. Garupe, in that story, he\u2019s committed, and then at a certain point he\u2019s, like, \u2018This is fucking bullshit.\u2019 I feel that with religion. I feel that with acting. I feel that with marriage. I feel that with being a parent. I\u2019m constantly filled with doubt, regardless of what I\u2019ve accomplished. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. You still don\u2019t know how to do anything, really.\u201d He described Kylo Ren, in \u201cStar Wars,\u201d as \u201cthe son of these two religious zealots\u201d\u2014meaning Han Solo and Leia\u2014who \u201ccan be conceived as being committed to this religion above all else, above family.\u201d Part of him still feels blindsided, as if he\u2019d missed a class and hadn\u2019t yet caught up on the wider world. While discussing \u201cFight Club,\u201d he asked what I thought of the movie. I said that I hadn\u2019t seen it in years but wondered how it would play in an era when people are hyperaware of toxic masculinity. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019?\u201d he asked. I suggested that male aggression is seen as less purifying now than it may have been portrayed as being in \u201cFight Club.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to think about it,\u201d Driver said. \u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t heard much about toxic masculinity.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cMaybe because I\u2019m part of the problem!\u201d Hours later, in his dressing room, he was talking about how his suspicion of dogma shaped him as an actor. \u201cFor a lot of times in my life, I was told there was a right answer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, when I got older, I was, like, \u2018That\u2019s fucking total bullshit.\u2019 I feel that very much with acting, too. If you knew how to do it, you would do it perfectly every time.\u201d He added, \u201cSo anytime anyone tells me, \u2018This is the right answer,\u2019 or \u2018There\u2019s something called toxic masculinity,\u2019 I\u2019m, like, What? What are you talking about? I\u2019m skeptical of it, because I feel like I was duped for seventeen years of my life.\u201d", "In early October, Driver was at Lincoln Center, where \u201cMarriage Story\u201d was the centerpiece of the New York Film Festival. He had flown in from Brussels, where he was filming \u201cAnnette,\u201d with the French director Leos Carax, and landed at 3:30 a.m. That evening, there was a red-carpet premi\u00e8re, and at midnight he would fly to England, for the London Film Festival. Baumbach said that when he was writing \u201cMarriage Story\u201d he had long phone conversations with Driver in which they discussed such classic movies as \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d and \u201cTo Be or Not to Be.\u201d One of their abandoned ideas, a film version of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical \u201cCompany,\u201d found its way into the script in the form of two musical numbers. (Baumbach told me that Driver had recently sent him a photograph of the Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard, who has a blond, Thor-like mane, with the message \u201cThis would be good for something.\u201d) At noon, Driver was clutching a cup of coffee in a greenroom at the Walter Reade Theatre, before a press conference. The cast trickled in: Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta. (Johansson was stuck in traffic.) Liotta, who plays a divorce lawyer, approached Driver. \u201cHey!\u201d he said in greeting, then struck a reverent tone. \u201cDid you serve?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Driver said shyly, standing to shake his hand. \u201cWow,\u201d Liotta said. \u201cThank you for your service. Seriously. My trainer was a marine.\u201d Driver quickly changed the subject. His military background makes him anomalous in Hollywood; the days of Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart leaving pictures to fly combat missions are long gone. Though his time in the Marine Corps was formative\u2014and gave rise to a nonprofit organization he founded, Arts in the Armed Forces, which fosters art appreciation among the troops\u2014it came to a disappointing end. After more than two years of training, Driver was preparing to ship out to Iraq. At the time, he wasn\u2019t thinking about the politics of the Iraq War, he said, just about his loyalty to his guys. One morning, he and his friend Garcia went mountain biking in Pendleton\u2019s Camp Horno. On the way down, Driver hit a ditch. The handlebars slammed into his chest, and he dislocated his sternum. Driver\u2019s first sergeant told him that he was too injured for the deployment. Attempting to prove otherwise, he loaded up on hydrocodone and worked out in the gym, but he made the damage worse. He was honorably discharged, while his former platoon shipped out to the southeast tip of Iraq, to run security missions on the Iranian border. It was early in the war, and the unit returned safely. But Driver was devastated. \u201cThey had gone and done the thing that we trained to do together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I felt like a piece of shit.\u201d Driver\u2019s platoon commander, Ed Hinman, had always found him more \u201cpensive\u201d than the others. \u201cThere was something more going on, I could tell, between his ears,\u201d he told me. Hinman said that life after the Marines can be tough under any circumstances. \u201cYou go from being in a family to being on your own, without an identity and without a mission. And, if you know it\u2019s coming, that\u2019s one thing. But if you don\u2019t, like Adam, that can be pretty scary.\u201d Humiliated, Driver drove back to Indiana in a Ford F-150 he\u2019d bought from an officer and enrolled at the University of Indianapolis, where he acted in Beckett\u2019s \u201cEndgame\u201d and in the musical \u201cPippin.\u201d He applied to be a policeman but was turned down, because he was under twenty-one\u2014\u201cWhich was ironic to me, because I was a SAW gunner, and suddenly I can\u2019t handle a Glock?\u201d\u2014so he got a job as a security guard. But he felt adrift, his mission unfulfilled. Then, remembering his brush-with-death vow to be a professional actor, he went back to Chicago and re-auditioned for Juilliard. Richard Feldman, a Juilliard teacher, recalled, \u201cThis very interesting young man walked in the room\u2014big, tall, lanky, with hair partially flopping over his face.\u201d Driver performed the opening lines from \u201cRichard III,\u201d a contemporary monologue he\u2019d found at a Barnes & Noble, and, for his musical selection, \u201cHappy Birthday to You.\u201d His acting wasn\u2019t polished, but, to Feldman, he radiated something genuine. Driver was guarding a Target distribution warehouse when he got the call that he\u2019d been accepted. \u201cI ran up and down the truck area, jumping around,\u201d he said. \u201cI was fucking elated.\u201d In the summer of 2005, he moved into a closet at an uncle\u2019s house, in Hoboken. He got a job at Aix, a French restaurant on the Upper West Side, where he served asparagus to Tony Kushner. He was as good at waiting tables as he was at selling vacuums. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of broccoli rabe,\u201d he said ruefully. Juilliard was a shock. He\u2019d gone from firing mortars to pretending to be a penguin in improv exercises. He was disdainful of civilian life, sneering at classmates who wore their shirts untucked or arrived late to class. One time, he snapped so sharply at a student who had used his yoga mat that he reduced the guy to tears. \u201cI was, like, I gotta be better at communicating,\u201d he said. He holed up at the performing-arts library and read plays by David Mamet and John Patrick Shanley, and found that drama helped him express his roiling emotions. His classmates were mystified by the hulking ex-marine. Gabriel Ebert, who later won a Tony Award for his role in \u201cMatilda the Musical,\u201d recalled their 9 a.m. movement classes: \u201cI probably got there at eight-forty-five to stretch, and Adam was already in a full sweat, like he\u2019d been there for at least an hour working out. He brought a discipline to his physical prowess that most of us didn\u2019t learn until well into our second year.\u201d Driver and Ebert got an apartment in Queens, and Driver would run five miles to school every day. He did pushups by the hundreds in the hallways and ate six eggs for breakfast (minus four of the yolks) and an entire chicken, from Balducci\u2019s, for lunch. Driver met Joanne Tucker, a classmate, during his first year. \u201cShe read a lot of books, knew a lot of shit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very composed.\u201d Her family lived in Waterside Plaza, in Murray Hill, and Driver would go over and eat all their cereal. Feldman, who, in 2013, officiated at their wedding, told me that Tucker didn\u2019t stand for Driver\u2019s holier-than-thou attitude: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take any nonsense.\u201d Acting wasn\u2019t entirely different from military life: both required a team effort and a sense of mission. But when Driver saw his marine buddies he would poke fun at his cushy new life, ashamed that he hadn\u2019t joined them overseas. In his third year, he and Tucker started Arts in the Armed Forces. At Camp Pendleton, the \u201cmandatory fun\u201d had included a skateboarding show and a trivia game in which you could win a date with a cheerleader. (The \u201cdate\u201d was a stroll around the parade deck.) \u201cEven at the time, I was, like, This is nice, but it\u2019s playing to the lowest common denominator,\u201d Driver said. He wanted to bring the troops something smarter, and show them that theatre didn\u2019t necessarily mean men in tights. Feldman told me, \u201cAdam was always trying to unite these two aspects of his life that seem to us in contemporary America so contradictory: how can you be a soldier\u2014a marine, of all things\u2014and an artist?\u201d Driver appealed to the U.S.O., but was told that the military demographic wouldn\u2019t be interested in plays, so he went to Juilliard\u2019s president for funding and solicited alumni to participate. In January, 2008, he returned to Camp Pendleton for AITAF\u2019s inaugural show, along with Ebert, Juilliard graduates including Laura Linney, and Jon Batiste, a jazz student from the music division (he is now the bandleader for \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d). Ebert recalled, \u201cJon and I stood in front of a grocery store at Camp Pendleton and handed out flyers for hours. \u2018Hey, you want to see some monologues? You want to see some jazz?\u2019 \u201d Around a hundred people showed up\u2014the competition was the college-football championship\u2014and watched monologues by Danny Hoch and Lanford Wilson, under a marquee that read \u201cJuilliard Performance: Adults Only.\u201d \u201cNo, not a hostile witness, Your Honor\u2014a frightened armadillo.\u201d Cartoon by Michael Maslin During his third year, Driver was cast in a play at the Humana Festival, in Louisville, Kentucky. Juilliard has a policy against students taking professional roles before graduation, so he would have to drop out. Feldman urged him to stay. \u201cI asked him to think about whether he had ever had the chance to finish anything in his life,\u201d Feldman recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d left college. He had to leave the Marines, because he got injured. And I challenged him to finish this.\u201d Driver went through every step of quitting except for turning in his keys\u2014and then changed his mind. His fourth year, he performed \u201cBurn This\u201d with Tucker and got an agent. He graduated in 2009. Driver had thought about becoming a firefighter if acting didn\u2019t pan out, but his career took off almost immediately. In 2010, he appeared in a Broadway revival of Shaw\u2019s \u201cMrs. Warren\u2019s Profession,\u201d with Cherry Jones, and in the HBO movie \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Jack,\u201d starring Al Pacino as Dr. Kevorkian. The next year, he played a gas-station attendant in \u201cJ. Edgar,\u201d directed by Clint Eastwood, and Frank Langella\u2019s son in the Broadway play \u201cMan and Boy.\u201d He and Langella became close. \u201cHe\u2019d come up to my country place on his motorcycle, play badminton, help move furniture, do the dishes,\u201d Langella recalled. \u201cOnce, at my New York place, I gave him some old suits of mine, and he left, bunching them in his arms, heading for the subway. \u2018Take a taxi,\u2019 I said. \u2018Nope,\u2019 he said. \u2018Too expensive.\u2019 \u201d Driver initially turned down the audition for \u201cGirls,\u201d on account of television being evil (\u201cI was an \u00e9litist prick,\u201d he says), but his agent persuaded him. The casting call described Adam Sackler as \u201ca carpenter, incredibly handsome, but slightly off.\u201d Driver showed up with a motorcycle helmet under his arm. Jenni Konner, Dunham\u2019s co-showrunner, recalled the reaction in the room as ecstatic. \u201cRemember the old Beatles films, where the women are screaming?\u201d she told me. \u201cThat\u2019s what his audition felt like.\u201d As the show evolved, details of Driver\u2019s life would seep into the scripts; in the third season, the fictional Adam lands a role in Shaw\u2019s \u201cMajor Barbara\u201d on Broadway, a nod to Driver\u2019s appearance in \u201cMrs. Warren\u2019s Profession.\u201d \u201cHe was always someone I saw as a rhinoceros, who picked one thing and ran toward it,\u201d Driver said of his character on \u201cGirls.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t see left or right at all, just sees what\u2019s immediately in front of him, and he chases it until he\u2019s exhausted.\u201d The first time Driver saw himself in \u201cGirls,\u201d on Dunham\u2019s laptop, he was mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s when I was, like, I can\u2019t watch myself in things. I certainly can\u2019t watch this if we\u2019re going to continue doing it,\u201d he said. Many actors decline to watch themselves, but for Driver that reluctance amounts to a phobia. In 2013, he watched the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d in which he has one scene, singing backup on a folk song called \u201cPlease Mr. Kennedy\u201d: \u201cI hated what I did.\u201d He swore off his own movies, until he was obliged to sit through the premi\u00e8re of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d in 2015. \u201cI just went totally cold,\u201d he recalled, \u201cbecause I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.\u201d The directors I spoke to sympathized with Driver\u2019s aversion. \u201cI think he\u2019s rightly concerned that he would become conscious of himself in a way that would be harmful to his acting,\u201d Soderbergh said. When I spoke to Baumbach, he was still \u201cin a discussion\u201d with Driver about watching \u201cMarriage Story.\u201d Spike Lee told me that Driver did see \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d at Cannes (\u201cIt was very, very happy\u201d), but Driver corrected the record: he had hidden out in a greenroom and returned for the closing bow."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/adam-driver-the-original-man", "id": "40b210b3-ae67-379a-a635-0d7d2183760d", "title": "Adam Driver, the Original Man", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino", "Anthony Lane", "John Lahr"], "summary": "Driver was six feet three and lanky, with squinty eyes, a beaky nose, and ears that stuck straight out.\nWhen Hannah spots him at a party in Bushwick and announces, \u201cThat\u2019s Adam,\u201d her friend Jessa deadpans, \u201cHe does sort of look like the original man.\u201d The same year, Driver had a small part in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln,\u201d as a telegraph operator.\nBut Driver has a range and an intensity that have transformed him into one of Hollywood\u2019s most unconventional leading men.\nYou didn\u2019t feel like he was putting on a show or that it was mannered.\nThe casting call described Adam Sackler as \u201ca carpenter, incredibly handsome, but slightly off.\u201d Driver showed up with a motorcycle helmet under his arm.", "pubDate": null}
