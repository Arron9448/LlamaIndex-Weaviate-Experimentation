In Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, players controlled a pair of characters simultaneously to play through an interactive fable. A Way Out gave two players a chance to break out of prison and experience life on the lam. The studio\u2019s latest project, It Takes Two, is a romantic comedy featuring more split-screen co-op, and also an insane amount of variety. In this episode of NGT, I share my experience playing three hours of the game with Blake Hester and Alex Stadnik \u2013 and how it nearly tore my family apart.", "OK, that\u2019s a little bit of hyperbole. I dragged one of my sons along with me for the co-op session, since we had a fun time playing through A Way Out together.

That led to a few heated moments as I missed critical jumps or he battered the plane he was flying along the walls of a narrow passageway. We persisted, however, and are all the stronger for it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself, at least.", "Anyway, enjoy the video! It Takes Two is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 26. And be sure to check out my feature on Hazelight\u2019s Josef Fares \u2013 he\u2019s an incredibly passionate and funny guy.", ""], "authors": [], "keywords": ["studios", "thats", "today", "sons", "playing", "started", "players", "work", "xbox", "way", "gameplay", "takes"], "pubDate": "2021-03-02T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
