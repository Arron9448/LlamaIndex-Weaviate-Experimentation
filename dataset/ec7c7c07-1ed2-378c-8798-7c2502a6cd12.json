This past week, fashion-forward celebrities such as Bella Hadid and Kylie, Kendall, and Kris Jenner touched down in Aspen, Colorado, dressed to impress. They all brought their best wintery gear to shred some powder or, better yet, to skip the winter activities all together and indulge in some shopping or apr\u00e8s-ski cocktails. It was less about the activity, more about the thematic fit.", "Kendall, for instance, chose showy outerwear like Aether\u2019s sunshine yellow puffer and Prada\u2019s silver jacket. Her sister Kylie went for pieces from 6 Moncler 1017 ALYX 9SM collaboration, in the Kardashian-signature neutral palette. When it came time for snowmobiling, Kylie wore a white Prada puffer complete with a hoodie, goggles, boots, and gloves, also by the label (is there anything more chic than a outdoorsy outfit filled with linea rossa?)", "Momager Kris got in on the fashion fun, too. Off the slopes, she was spotted in a pair of fuzzy snow boots with a dramatic double pom pom hat to match. While out shopping, she and Kendall were also spotted in the same pair of chunky Prada monolith boots\u2014the ultimate stompy snowshoes.", "Meanwhile, model Bella Hadid\u2014a close Kardashian-Jenner friend\u2014was also spotted in Aspen flexing a sleek getup. Her white zip-up and snow pants were by Aztech Mountain, and seemed to be gifted to her from Mugler\u2019s creative director, Casey Cadwallader, who also is Aztech's head of design (she thanked him for her \u201cski fit\u201d in her Instagram stories today). Underneath, she also wore a white turtleneck that read \u201cWhassup?\u201d\u2014possibly a nod to the paparazzi who was waiting for her at the bottom of the hill. Even on a mountain, celebrities like their ensembles camera-ready.", "Below, more of the best winter fashion from Aspen this week.", "Photo: Backgrid"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["ski", "wore", "street", "winter", "slopes", "snow", "white", "shopping", "slope", "kylie", "aspen", "spotted", "style"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
