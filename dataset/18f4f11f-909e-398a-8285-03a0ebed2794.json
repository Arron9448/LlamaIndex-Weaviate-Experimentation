Then 19 years old, she performed her original poem \u201cIn This Place: An American Lyric\u201d at the Library of Congress, weaving a story of contemporary America that touched on everything from DACA to mass shootings to the Charlottesville riots, while still maintaining a sense of beauty and hope. The piece now sits in New York\u2019s Morgan Library & Museum alongside works by some of the greatest figures from American literary history.", "All the same, Gorman\u2019s keen eye for fashion didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Embracing the possibilities of style as a storytelling device all of its own, her love of color and bold prints at events and readings caught the eye of Prada, who invited her to their Milan Fashion Week shows throughout 2019. It was no coincidence, then, that when Gorman was preparing for the event that would catapult her to global fame\u2014namely, her showstopping recital of \u201cThe Hill We Climb\u201d on Inauguration Day in January\u2014Prada was the obvious go-to when she found herself looking for an outfit ahead of the event.", "Gorman attends the Prada show during Milan Fashion Week in February 2019.

Despite the last-minute nature of bringing the look together, Gorman still approached it with the same care and consideration she did every other aspect of her performance. \u201cGorman loves how [clothes] help her shape her image,\u201d St. F\u00e9lix writes, retelling the story behind the genius styling twist of Gorman repurposing the red satin headband as a kind of diadem, and explaining that it was her mother\u2019s suggestion to place it at the fore of her head and wear it like \u201ca tiara, a crown.\u201d"], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["f\u00e9lix", "amanda", "st", "star", "milan", "prada", "kind", "2019", "gorman", "style", "library", "week", "fashion", "place"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
