Political leaders are organising mass rallies, far more focused on fighting each other than any virus. If poorer Nepalis are struggling with the dire economic fallout from Covid-19, on the surface, at least, it appears daily life in the capital, Kathmandu, is back to normal.", "\u201cIt\u2019s as if nothing has happened. The nightclubs are crowded. Schools and colleges are reopening. Sports venues are full. It doesn\u2019t seem like there is any Covid,\u201d says Sameer Mani Dixit, a public health specialist. \u201cIt defies logic.\u201d", "With a weak public health system, families of several generations sharing crowded accommodation and a vast migrant workforce returning from India, the coronavirus looked likely to take a serious toll in Nepal, one of Asia\u2019s poorest countries.", "Instead, the infection rate has fallen steadily, from an average of 3,000 daily cases in October to about 300 in January. Last week, Nepal recorded its first day since August without a Covid-related death. In total, just over 2,000 people have died since the beginning of the outbreak, in a population of nearly 30 million.", "\u201cThe number of cases is definitely going down. The hospital admission rate is very low \u2026 Overall, it seems the virus has been contained at this stage,\u201d says Basu Dev Pandey, a former director of the government\u2019s Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.", "Experts say it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind the country\u2019s apparently low rate of infection, owing to a lack of reliable data, but Dr Anup Subedi, an infectious disease physician, points out that there has been limited testing and warns that the country is still vulnerable to new strains. \u201cIf new variants come, herd immunity doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone becomes vulnerable again. My big fear is that this thing can explode again and we don\u2019t have the measures in place to respond,\u201d he says.", "Members of the Nepal Communist Party protest in Kathmandu against prime minister KP Sharma Oli\u2019s dissolution of parliament, 10 February 2021. Photograph: Narendra Shrestha/EPA", "Although the government imposed a national lockdown in March, which ended in July, and barred even its own citizens from returning from overseas, critics say its management of the virus has been haphazard, with little proactive case tracing, few controls on the open border with India and an ineffective quarantine system.", "\u201cThe government has been very inefficient. There has been a reluctance to engage experts and use data and science. The prime minister has failed to follow public health advice. He has been giving mixed messages,\u201d says Subedi.", "Amid the pandemic, the ruling Communist party has been preoccupied with infighting. Despite a large majority, the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved parliament in December and called for early elections in an apparent bid to renege on a power-sharing agreement with a rival \u2013 a move his opponents claim is unconstitutional.", "The move has sparked a series of protest rallies organised by groups from across the political spectrum \u2013 rival factions of the Communist party, the opposition Nepali Congress party and civil society activists \u2013 with tens of thousands turning out.", "Prime minister KP Sharma Oli addresses a rally in Kathmandu on 5 February 2021. He has been criticised for playing politics as the country\u2019s economic crisis worsens.

Levels of unemployment and personal debt have soared, particularly for those working in tourism and the informal sector.", "Remittances from the millions of Nepalis working overseas have remained high, but the World Bank has estimated the economy grew by only 0.2% in 2020, down from 7% the previous year.", "On the southern edge of Kathmandu, Shova Shrestha used to made a living selling vegetables from a small cart. That came to an abrupt end when lockdown began and she has been unable to restart the business.", "Almost everyone in this region depends on tourism, but we have not earned a single thing since March Nyima Tsering Sherpa", "\u201cLife after lockdown has been really hard for me. I\u2019m looking for work but I can\u2019t find anything. My husband has started drinking. I\u2019m not able to pay school fees for my children,\u201d says Shrestha.", "Around the towering peaks of the Everest region, the tourism industry has been devastated. The government had hoped to attract 2 million tourists in 2020, but only 230,000 arrived, and most of those in the months before lockdown, representing a fall of more than 80% against the previous year.", "Dingboche, a community on the well-trodden route to Everest base camp, used to see 500 to 700 trekkers a day during the busiest season, but since the start of the pandemic the flow of tourists, and money, has stopped.", "Nyima Tsering Sherpa, who runs a lodge in the village, says: \u201cAlmost everyone in this region depends on tourism, but we have not earned a single thing since March. Now we are just relying on savings. At first, people were afraid of the virus, but now the only concern is a lack of money.\u201d", "A farmer works at sunrise during a cold winter morning in Khokana, south of Kathmandu, 6 January 2021.

The Harawa-Charawa, a community of indentured agricultural labourers, often forced to work for landlords in order to pay back high-interest debts, have been particularly hard hit.", "During lockdown, many were unable to travel to their landlord\u2019s fields, leaving them with no source of wages. Tens of thousands of migrant workers returned from India or Nepal\u2019s cities, further increasing the pressure on household incomes.", "Many Harawa-Charawa families were forced to rely on handouts or in some cases took further high-interest loans, pushing them deeper into debt. Those who could work were paid even less than usual \u2013 as little as \u00a31.25 a day \u2013 as landlords took advantage of the desperate circumstances.", "Waiting for public transport during a general strike in Kathmandu, 4 February 2021.
