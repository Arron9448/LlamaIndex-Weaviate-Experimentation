In a private conversation this summer, a senior US national security leader asked me if I\u2019d noticed anything in the latest trailer for the new Top Gun sequel, backed by China\u2019s Tencent. He had: The trailer shows Tom Cruise\u2019s character wearing a leather bomber jacket that had apparently undergone a few alterations since the original film. Gone were the patches of the Taiwanese and Japanese flags. More recently, National Basketball Association executives gave groveling, abject apologies after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. It was a sign of the league\u2019s fear of angering a fast-\u00adgrowing fan base\u2014and business opportunity\u2014in mainland China.", "Meanwhile, as one US supplier told me, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from members of the White House, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do business with China.\u2019 There\u2019s no reason for one company versus another\u2014it\u2019s just \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be in business with China.\u2019\u201d", "China and the US are forcing consumers, companies, and whole countries to decide how they see the world. Will it be the Chinese way or the Western way?", "Over the past year, Trump officials have been concerned to discover that not all traditional allies will automatically side with the US. Despite bombast and threats, Mike Pompeo\u2019s lobbying efforts in Europe against Huawei met with only mixed success. Germany forged ahead with incorporating Huawei into its 5G system. \u201cOur allies aren\u2019t standing with us in the way that we thought,\u201d one senior Trump administration official says.", "In some ways, the companies that face such questions say it\u2019s precisely because of the Trump administration\u2019s hard-hitting strategy that its appeals are falling on deaf ears. As the supplier executive told me, \u201cHuawei has become a scapegoat for our broader issues. Is it any wonder some of our allies aren\u2019t going along with our bazooka strategy?\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the White House, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do business with China,\u2019 there\u2019s no one company versus another\u2014it\u2019s just \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be in business with China.\u2019\u201d", "Standing alongside hard-hat-wearing telecom workers in the White House last spring, President Trump trumpeted his commitment to \u201cwinning\u201d the 5G race. As he said, \u201cWe cannot allow any other country to outcompete the United States in this powerful industry of the future. We are leading by so much in so many different industries of that type, and we just can\u2019t let that happen. The race to 5G is a race America must win, and it\u2019s a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in.\u201d", "Yet by almost any measure, the US seems set for defeat. South Korea deployed a 5G network last year, claiming to have signed up more than a million customers in just 10 weeks. (According to South Korea\u2019s government, Huawei\u2019s hardware represents about 10 percent of the network, with the remainder from Samsung and other firms.) China surely will end up with more 5G users than any other country.", "In recent months, the administration has begun to tap special government programs to encourage further 5G growth and innovation, but such efforts appear to be both late and underwhelming. Elsa Kania, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an astute observer of China\u2019s military technology, concluded in a report this fall that \u201cthe US government has yet to commit to any funding or national initiatives in 5G that are close to comparable in scope and scale to those of China, which is dedicating hundreds of billions to 5G development and deployment.\u201d", "This shortfall has sparked broader concerns about future US technological development. Verizon is leading the push to set up 5G networks, with pilot projects in several cities using Ericsson-made base stations. But the US is a very, very long way from ubiquitous 5G. \u201cThis is the first example of what\u2019s going to happen again and again,\u201d Senator Mitt Romney said in an October hearing on 5G and supply chain security, warning that the US is now ill-equipped to face China as a technological rival. \u201cWe as a nation don\u2019t have a strategy. We respond on an ad hoc basis.\u201d"], "authors": ["Garrett M. Graff", "Garrett M.
