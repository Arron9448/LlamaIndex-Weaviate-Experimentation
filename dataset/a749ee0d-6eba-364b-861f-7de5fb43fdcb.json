Late on Sunday afternoon, the office of the Colorado Democratic representative Jason Crow released a readout of a call in which army secretary Ryan McCarthy \u201cindicated that [the Department of Defense] is aware of further possible threats posed by would-be terrorists in the days up to and including Inauguration Day\u201d.", "According to the readout, McCarthy said the Pentagon was \u201cworking with local and federal law enforcement to coordinate security preparations\u201d for 20 January.", "Crow, a former US army ranger, said he had \u201craised grave concerns about reports that active duty and reserve military members were involved in the insurrection\u201d and asked that \u201ctroops deployed for the inauguration \u2026 are not sympathetic to domestic terrorists\u201d. The readout said McCarthy agreed and said he was willing to testify publicly in the coming days.", "Earlier on Sunday, from the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he had asked FBI director Christopher Wray to \u201crelentlessly pursue\u201d those who attacked the Capitol.", "The mob ransacked offices and assaulted the Senate and House chambers after being told by Trump to \u201cfight like hell\u201d, resulting in chaos and the deaths of five people including a police officer and a rioter who was shot by law enforcement.", "\u201cThe threat of violent extremist groups remains high,\u201d Schumer said.", "While security was stepped up around the Capitol, political chess continued, with the White House belatedly lowering its US flag to half-staff in honour of those who died.", "Trump faced growing calls from within his own party to step down, with one prominent Republican senator accusing him of a \u201cdescent into madness\u201d.", "\u201cThe behaviour was outrageous, and there should be accountability,\u201d Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.", "\u201cThe president\u2019s behaviour after the election was wildly different than his behaviour before he descended into a level of madness and engaged in activity that was just absolutely unthinkable and unforgivable.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s resignation, Toomey said, becoming the second Republican senator to call for the president to go, \u201cis the best path forward, the best way to get this person in the rearview mirror\u201d.", "In a survey by ABC News and Ipsos published on Sunday, 56% of respondents said Trump should be removed before 20 January.

Biden has been lukewarm about impeachment and concerns are growing among Democrats that an early trial would distract from vital Senate business, such as confirming cabinet members and passing Covid-19 relief.", "\u201cLet\u2019s give President Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running and maybe we\u2019ll send the articles sometime after that,\u201d Clyburn said.", "The congressman also promoted a possible second article of impeachment, related to Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud and an infamous call pressuring Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse defeat there.", "\u201cWe heard it on the phone, begging at one time, ordering at another time, and threatening criminal action to overturn the vote to find him 11,700 odd votes.

That also seems unlikely.", "\u201cEvery minute and every hour that [Trump] is in office represents a clear and present danger, not just to the United States Congress but, frankly, to the country,\u201d the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told ABC\u2019s This Week.", "\u201cIf we allow insurrection against the United States with impunity, with no accountability, we are inviting it to happen again. If a foreign head of state ordered an attack on the United States Congress, would we say that that should not be prosecuted? No. It is an act of insurrection. It\u2019s an act of hostility.\u201d", "The Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger, a vocal Trump critic, said the president had instigated \u201cone of the worst days in American history\u201d.", "Kinzinger added: \u201cHe stirred up a crowd.
