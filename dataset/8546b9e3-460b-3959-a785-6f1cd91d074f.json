Miche\u00e1l Martin, has called for the EU and UK to \u201cdial down the rhetoric\u201d before crisis talks in London between the European commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Michael Gove, as tensions escalate over post-Brexit problems in Northern Ireland.", "Amid mounting anger in EU capitals at UK demands for a rethink on the issue, Martin said there were \u201celements the British government could sort out, but likewise on the European side I would say some member states need to cool it as well\u201d.", "In a letter to Gove late on Wednesday, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d ruled out major changes to the Brexit deal\u2019s Northern Ireland protocol, saying the EU was not prepared even to consider any \u201cflexibilities\u201d until the UK fulfilled the obligations to which it had already signed up.", "\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d detailed a series of what he called \u201cshortcomings\u201d in the UK\u2019s observance of border arrangements in Northern Ireland under the protocol, which requires goods shipped from Britain to the region to meet strict EU customs rules.", "Measures to which Britain signed up as part of the agreement reached last December \u201curgently need to be fully and faithfully implemented\u201d as a \u201cprerequisite to assess whether any facilitation, as requested, is necessary or justified,\u201d he wrote.", "The letter reflects anger in some EU capitals at what they see as British attempts to exploit controversy over the commission\u2019s brief move to trigger article 16 of the protocol last month in an effort to prevent vaccine exports getting into the UK.", "The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has apologised for the move, saying it was a mistake she deeply regretted, and the commission is working on mechanisms to ensure future EU legislation is double-checked for its impact on Northern Ireland.", "But there is resentment among several member states at Britain\u2019s subsequent attempt to capitalise on the commission\u2019s blunder by demanding a wholesale rethink of the protocol, which was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.", "The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Thursday that both parties must be conscious of their responsibilities. \u201cThe difficulties on the island of Ireland are caused by Brexit, not by the protocol, Barnier said. \u201cThe protocol is the solution.\u201d", "Last week Boris Johnson accused the EU of appearing to \u201ccast doubt\u201d on the Good Friday agreement by triggering article 16, while Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said the episode had \u201cchanged the political situation\u201d and demanded fundamental changes to the protocol.", "Johnson\u2019s spokesperson struck a bullish tone in advance of Thursday\u2019s meeting, suggesting it was for the EU to \u201crestore confidence\u201d after the botched triggering of article 16.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve set out the areas that need resolution, where there are issues that have come to the fore, and that\u2019s why Michael Gove will be holding this meeting later today,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIt remains our position that we want to see these issues addressed as soon as possible.\u201d", "Asked whether the government had failed to implement aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol, as \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d suggested in his letter, the spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain committed to the protocol.\u201d", "EU diplomats have objected particularly strongly to the tone of a letter from Gove, who co-chairs the EU-UK joint committee on Northern Ireland with \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, to his European counterpart on 2 February, with one describing its tone as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.", "With freight arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain facing serious delays and disruption, Gove demanded a two-year postponement of the introduction of full checks on supermarket food, medicines and parcels until 2023.", "He also called for an \u201curgent reset\u201d of the other parts of the protocol, including a permanent reduction of bureaucratic barriers hindering the movement of pets, plants and food products to the region, through \u201cpolitical, not technical\u201d solutions.", "\u201cIt\u2019s clear the commission made a serious mistake on article 16,\u201d another EU diplomat said. \u201cBut the British response is transparent and infuriating. It is using that mistake as an excuse to demand we tear up parts of an agreement it signed up to.\u201d", "David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told the Lords EU committee on Tuesday that a resolution to the increasingly strained relations required a \u201cdifferent spirit\u201d from the EU, which he said was struggling to get used to a \u201cgenuinely independent actor in its neighbourhood\u201d.", "But \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said in his reply to Gove that \u201cblanket derogations\u201d from EU rules on meat products and parcels \u201ccannot be agreed beyond what the protocol foresees already\u201d, while more flexibility on pets and plants would entail \u201cthe UK committing to align with the relevant EU rules\u201d.", "The EU vice-president also said Britain was not complying with the terms of the protocol in a number of areas. Border control posts at ports in Northern Ireland were not yet fully operational, he said, while official controls were \u201ccurrently not being performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and EU rules\u201d.", "There were \u201cvery few identity checks\u201d on goods and \u201ca very limited number of physical checks other than on live animals, fish and plants\u201d, he said, while \u201cnon-compliant consignments\u201d were being accepted even if destined for Ireland.", "Packages were not being monitored as required, goods were entering Northern Ireland \u201cwithout being declared or without valid certificates\u201d, and the UK had \u201cnot fulfilled its obligation\u201d to allow the EU real-time access to key customs IT systems.", "\u2022 This article was amended on 11 February 2021 to clarify that the commission moved to trigger article 16 but backtracked before it was due to come into force."], "authors": ["Jon Henley", "Heather Stewart"], "keywords": ["uk", "protocol", "ireland", "eu", "commission", "northern", "dial", "crisis", "asks", "\u0161ef\u010dovi\u010d", "rhetoric", "letter", "gove", "brexit", "talks", "irish", "article"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
