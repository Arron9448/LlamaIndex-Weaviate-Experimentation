Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good morning. The video evidence, I think, will be very helpful and meaningful to you because you can see it for yourself without lawyer talk, lawyer spin, lawyer anything. You can see it for yourself.\u201d \u201cPlease. Please. I can\u2019t breathe. Please, man. Please somebody help me. Please. I\u2019m about to die in this thing.\u201d \u201cOh my God.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d \u201cHe said, I\u2019m about to die. Oh my God.\u201d \u201cWhile watching the George Floyd trial, I noticed the differences and the importance of footage.\u201d \u201cThis corner \u2014\u201d \u201cWhen Stephon was murdered, we only had the officers\u2019 footage. We only had their point of view.\u201d \u201cHey, show your hands.\u201d \u201cYou know, when my son was killed being on the platform, there was several bystanders that filmed. And had it not been for the cameras, we wouldn\u2019t even be here today because they would have probably said it was justified.\u201d \u201cBro, with your feet on his head, man. You knee on his neck.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s pushing harder.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cI cannot breathe.\u201d \u201cA little bit more. Right here.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t watch the footage of my dad\u2019s incident because it\u2019s torture.\u201d \u201cYou see the officers giving a trove of blows to his body?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTo his arms, to his torso, to his legs.\u201d \u201cHere it is 30 years later, nothing has changed.\u201d \u201cNow who are you going to believe? The defendants or your own eyes?\u201d \u201cI am watching the George Floyd case with my best friend, Tiffany, at her home.\u201d \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s still on his neck.\u201d \u201cToday was the first time I watched the entire video of George Floyd, and it definitely made me think about my dad begging for his life screaming.\u201d \u201cCheck his pulse. Check his pulse.\u201d \u201cHis daughter was the same age I was when my dad was beaten.\u201d \u201cMy name is Lora Dene King. I\u2019m the middle child of Rodney Glen King.\u201d \u201cThe world saw the videotape.\u201d \u201cWe thought the video showed excessive force and unnecessary force.\u201d \u201cWith that videotape, if they had two eyes and they weren\u2019t blind, you could see that it was excessive force.\u201d \u201cThe defense tried to dilute the impact of the tape by dissecting it, frame by frame, in an effort to show that King was a threat to the officers.\u201d \u201cHe kind of gave out like a bear-like yell, like a wounded animal. If he had grabbed my officer, it would have been a death grip. If he had grabbed the weapon, he would have had numerous targets.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t grab anybody during these events, did he?\u201d \u201cNo sir, he did not.\u201d \u201cHe couldn\u2019t walk. He had 50 broken bones. His skull was permanently fractured. He had permanent brain damage. My dad was never the same after that. You know, and everybody just considered him to be normal. I think if that happened to anybody, they wouldn\u2019t be normal ever again.\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just affect the person it happened to. It also affects all those people who are out there watching it. They\u2019re all affected forever.\u201d \u201cI was desperate to help.\u201d \u201cI was just kind of emotional, and I went to the African-American that was standing there on the curb. And I was just like, they\u2019re not going to help them.\u201d \u201cOh my God.\u201d \u201cThis man, he witnessed another African-American man getting his life taken. The nine-year-old speaker on the trial.\u201d \u201cGood morning, [inaudible].\u201d \u201cGood morning.\u201d \u201cWhich one is you?\u201d \u201cJust so happened to be walking down the street. She will never forget that for the rest of her life.\u201d \u201cYou ultimately ended up posting your video to social media, right?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cAnd it went viral?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cIt changed your life, right?\u201d \u201cThe girl who filmed George Floyd, the fact that there was nothing she can do to save his life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been nights, I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something that will haunt her like George Holliday, who captured my dad\u2019s video.\u201d \u201cWithout George Holliday, these four officers might not be on trial.\u201d \u201cHe just wanted to test this new camera he had. Like, oh let me take \u2014 he stood there shaking, terrified. And he still suffers to this day because that was the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cWhat could he have done to deserve that?\u201d \u201cIf I was to see George Floyd\u2019s daughter today, I wish there was something I can say. But it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not easy at all. Because I\u2019m sure she\u2019s watched that videotape. And that\u2019s something that carries in your mental every everyday, just like my dad\u2019s video tape.\u201d \u201cFor the jury, a difficult decision ahead, knowing that to acquit the four officers could ignite this city.\u201d \u201cNot guilty of \u2014\u201d Chanting: \u201cNo justice, no peace. No justice, no peace.\u201d \u201cAnd damage to the city of Los Angeles running into billions of dollars.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. The police, they don\u2019t pay a cent for this trial. So my mother and I, we was watching the George Floyd\u2019s trial. And it brought back so many memories of my son Oscar\u2019s case. Oscar\u2019s last picture in his cellphone was of the officer who shot him.\u201d \u201cMy name is Wanda Johnson. I\u2019m the mother of Oscar Grant.\u201d \u201cGrant was shot once in the back as he lay face down on the train station\u2019s platform.\u201d \u201cHe was unarmed.\u201d \u201cThe 27-year-old officer has said he thought he had drawn his Taser gun \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 but accidentally pulled out his handgun instead.\u201d \u201cAnd the incident was captured on cellphone video.\u201d \u201cVideo speaks for themselves. And the jury will see that and make the correct decision.\u201d \u201cWe knew that we would have a very hard time winning in the court systems because the judicial system was not made for everyone in the society.\u201d \u201cAs the situation went on, the crowd began to grow and grow.\u201d \u201cOh my goodness, the same playbook that they used for what happened with Oscar, they used the same thing for George Floyd. Oh, there was a crowd of angry mob people.\u201d \u201cThey were behind them. There were people across the street, people yelling.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they were going to attack us. I thought about the young man testifying in George Floyd\u2019s case.\u201d \u201cYou grew angrier and angrier.\u201d \u201cCalling the police on the police.\u201d \u201c911, what\u2019s the address of the emergency?\u201d \u201cHow do you have somebody investigate those that they work with? Of course you\u2019re going to find that they\u2019re going to believe the people that they work with quicker than they will believe the citizens who are filing the complaint.\u201d \u201cWould you like to speak with those sergeants?\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to. He was unresponsive. He wasn\u2019t resisting arrest or any of this.\u201d \u201cOK, one second.\u201d \u201cMurderers, bro. Y\u2019all are just murderers, bro.\u201d \u201cYou know, when we was going to jury trial for Oscar, they would ask questions like, \u2018Do you know anybody who went to jail? Do you know anybody who had an encounter with the police?\u2019 And as soon as the person said that, they would strike them from being a juror, right? Having a jury that consists of different backgrounds, it could help with the decision-making of innocent or guilty.\u201d \u201cThe 27-year-old officer \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.\u201d \u201cHis trial had been moved to Los Angeles over concerns of racial tension and intense media scrutiny.\u201d \u201cEverybody, let\u2019s just pray for one minute.\u201d \u201cFather God, we come to you and your son named Jesus Christ. Father, we ask the people that see this \u2014\u201d \u201cEvery time I come to my mom\u2019s house, I\u2019m reminded that my son was killed here.\u201d \u201cMy name is Sequette Clark. I\u2019m the mother of Stephon Clark.\u201d \u201c22-year-old Stephon Clark was fatally shot while running from police.\u201d \u201cClark was see evading authorities after allegedly smashing a car window.\u201d \u201cHe was shot eight times in his grandmother\u2019s backyard.\u201d \u201cPolice apparently thinking he was holding a gun, now say it was a cellphone.\u201d \u201cOut of fear for their own lives, they fired their service weapon.\u201d \u201cAnd following the incident, officers manually muted their body cameras at times.\u201d \u201cMove over this way.\u201d \u201cAs we watched the George Floyd trial, I invited particular members of my family because you can\u2019t address something in the community or the city or the nation until you address it at home with the family.\u201d \u201cWhen Mr. Floyd was in distress, Mr. Chauvin wouldn\u2019t help him, didn\u2019t help him.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s just how they left my boy out there. They handcuffed him after he was dead.\u201d \u201cExcessive force.\u201d \u201cExcessive force and lethal force after the fact of death. I felt saddened, heavy, drained. I felt as if I was a slave 400 years ago. Just hearing how he was dead, seeing how he was dead. And then to turn around and hear the defense\u2019s attempt to bring up the fact that we should not focus on the \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 9 minutes and 29 seconds \u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014 that it took to kill George Floyd. But we should focus on what went on ahead of that. Anything that does not deal directly with the murder of George Floyd is irrelevant in my opinion.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. You did not know that he had taken heroin. Mr. Floyd did use a counterfeit $20 bill to purchase a pack of cigarettes. Mr. Floyd put drugs in his mouth.\u201d \u201cPoppa\u2019s already dead. George Floyd is already dead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cSo now you\u2019re resurrecting him just to kill him all over again.\u201d \u201cBasically.\u201d \u201cDefame him in order to justify the wrongdoing of your officers, reminded me exactly of what the district attorney did to Stephon.\u201d \u201cThe cellphone examination revealed a domestic violence incident that happened with the mother of his children. Texts and phone calls showing that he was seeking drugs and a photograph of his hand holding 10 Xanax pills.\u201d \u201cWhat was on his cellphone has zero to do with the actions of the police officers at the time of his homicide. I feel like it\u2019s a bittersweet thing that\u2019s happening watching the George Floyd trial. Because I\u2019m optimistic that this is a piece of justice for the death of my son.\u201d \u201cWe might not be here. They\u2019re going to get him. They\u2019re going to get him.\u201d \u201cWas a crime committed? The answer to that question is no. And as a result, we will not charge these officers with any criminal liability related to the shooting death or the use of force of Stephon Clark.\u201d \u201cApril 14, 1991: King fights emotional and physical scars. So this is basically a photo album book of my dad\u2019s newspaper articles since he\u2019s been in the news. Years and years and years. You throw someone to the wolves and you expect them to be normal. You know, there\u2019s no such thing as normal after that. And then, can you imagine how many Rodney Kings there is that never got videotaped? There\u2019s plenty of them.\u201d \u201cI would have prayed and hoped that Oscar\u2019s trial would have been televised because America has to really look in the mirror and say, \u2018Are all people being treated equally?\u2019\u201d \u201cThere was excessive use of force against George Floyd \u2014\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on the videotape, his toxicology, his heart condition. We\u2019re focused on the fact that several people witnessed this man get murdered.\u201d \u201cYou can see it with our own eyes. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize what it does to your family. It\u2019s bigger than just a trial and this officer. We never get to see them again. We never get to smell them again and kiss them again. Our lives are completely affected forever.\u201d"], "authors": ["Audra D. S.
