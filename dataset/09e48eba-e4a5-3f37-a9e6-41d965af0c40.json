The two were linked, explained Jo Fells, head of communications at Waddesdon.

He was acting as his father's salesman. You ought to buy it'.", "\"So we did buy it,\" he said of the cup, which now stands next to the painting of the same cup in Waddesdon's treasure room.", "A painting of a boy holding a silver cup hangs above the cup itself.
