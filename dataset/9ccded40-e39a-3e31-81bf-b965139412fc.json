And they have the power to shift limiting representations of Black women. \u201cThere were so many times where I would take photos, and whoever I\u2019m working with was like, \u2018Now, can you be really fierce and growl?\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can I just be tender?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cWhite women get to be that all the time. So I loved the fact that I could be this woman who is powerful while still gentle. Can I be a carefree Black girl?!\u201d Already a lover of essential oils, incense, and floral fragrances, she was drawn to the perfume itself: a heady blend of tuberose, jasmine, and sandalwood. \u201cScent really has the power to shift your mood, to calm you, to excite you,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s always been very important to me.\u201d", "Turner-Smith in a Gucci dress and earrings.

After giving birth in April, she\u2019s used quarantine to recover (she recounted her nearly four-day labor in a much-read essay for British Vogue) and spend uninterrupted time with her daughter. \u201cI had to learn how to breastfeed and how to be a mum\u2014it really worked out for my baby,\u201d she says. Turner-\u00adSmith\u2019s mother ended up staying with them for three months during the lockdown, and having her and Jackson at home was a \u201ccomfort\u201d from the chaos outside. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that we still have to be screaming to the world that our lives matter. It doesn\u2019t make sense that Black people are being senselessly mowed down by the police,\u201d Turner-Smith goes on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, this country\u2019s response to the global pandemic.
