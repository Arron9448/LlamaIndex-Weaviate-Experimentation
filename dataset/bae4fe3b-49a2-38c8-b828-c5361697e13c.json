Across the country the storm claimed at least four lives, affected about 12,500 miles (20,000km) of roads and left thousands trapped in their cars for as many as 12 hours without food and water.", "In Madrid\u2019s hospitals, already stretched by a coronavirus caseload that ranks among the highest in the country, weary staff scrambled to cope. Healthcare workers doubled and tripled their shifts to cover for colleagues who were unable to make it in, while one hospital turned its gym into a makeshift dormitory for workers who could not get home.", "With roads blocked and commuter trains cancelled, nursing assistant Ra\u00fal Alcojor walked 14km to make it to his shift at a hospital on the outskirts of the city. \u201cMorally I couldn\u2019t stay at home,\u201d he said, citing colleagues that had been working for more than 24 hours.", "The trip took him two hours and 28 minutes, complicated by the many fallen trees and snow that at times was 40cm deep. \u201cI told myself, \u2018go for it,\u2019\u201d Alcojor told broadcaster Cadena Ser. \u201cIf I get there, I\u2019m there. If I don\u2019t make it, I\u2019ll turn around.\u201d", "Others had the same idea. One nurse shared her story as she made the 20km journey to her hospital on foot while a video posted on social media showed two nurses walking 22km to reach Madrid\u2019s 12 de Octubre hospital.", "Dely (@maraquinta) Ellos Enfermeros Paco&M\u00f3nica, 22km caminando bajo la nieve para llegar al relevo en la #UCI del Hospital 12 de Octubre!!!

Across Spain the virus has killed more than 51,000 people while the cumulative number of confirmed cases recently passed the 2m mark.", "On Sunday the country slowly shovelled its way out of the storm, with volunteers using everything from frying pans to brooms to clear streets and hospital entrances. The central government said it was working to organise police-escorted convoys to ensure the storm would not delay deliveries of the Covid-19 vaccine or lead to food shortages.", "Supermarkets experienced a repeat of the scenes of March, with shelves sitting empty as people stocked up on basic goods and toilet paper.

Some glided through Madrid on skis, others had impromptu snowball fights or turned the city\u2019s central plaza into a dance party.", "The storm was blamed for the deaths of four people across the country: a man and woman whose car was swept away by a flooded river near the town of Fuengirola, a 54-year-man in Madrid who was found buried in snow, and a homeless man who died of hypothermia in the northern city of Zaragoza."], "authors": ["Ashifa Kassam"], "keywords": ["snow", "stay", "staff", "spain", "workers", "colleagues", "madrid", "hours", "hospital", "country", "walk", "relieve", "roads", "storm"], "pubDate": "2021-01-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
