If American corporations have been captured by activists eager to \u201ccancel\u201d dissenters, then workers need robust protections in the event they run afoul of an overzealous human resources department or some \u201cwoke\u201d Walmart commissar.", "A higher federal minimum wage and a more robust social safety net would also work to strengthen employees vis-\u00e0-vis their employers. The less an individual worker needs to rely on market income to survive, the more he or she can pick and choose between jobs. The more corporations have to spend on recruiting and retaining workers, the less they can spend on influencing politics.", "If \u201cwoke capital\u201d is a real problem, then it\u2019s a labor issue as much as it is a cultural one. And there are many other policies \u2014 antitrust regulations against tech companies, \u201cco-determination\u201d to give workers a seat at the corporate table and strict limits on corporate political spending, to name just a few \u2014 that would curb the power of corporations to impose their values on both their employees and the broader public.", "We know, of course, that Republicans aren\u2019t interested in any of this. McConnell might denounce actual corporate speech, but he is a major recipient of corporate dollars and a staunch defender of corporate spending in elections. (He has already backed off on his comments. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that very artfully,\u201d he explained the next day.) Neither Rubio nor Hawley has ever met a corporate tax cut he couldn\u2019t support, and the entire Republican Party is united in support of an anti-labor politics that puts ordinary workers at the mercy of capital.", "Recall Senator Mitt Romney\u2019s critique of the White House\u2019s relief package from February: \u201cThe Biden stimulus calls for checks of $400 a week in addition to state checks through September. At that level, the majority of the unemployed would make more by not working. Employers already complain that they can\u2019t find employees.\u201d", "Republican \u201cwoke capital\u201d critics are not actually interested in curbing corporate influence and putting power in the hands of workers. They don\u2019t have a problem with corporate speech as a matter of principle. They have a problem with corporate speech as a matter of politics. If the situation were reversed, and corporations were vocal supporters of \u201celection integrity,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine that McConnell or his allies would have a problem.", "\u201cWoke\u201d capital also does not actually exist. A Black Lives Matter advertisement does not make up for the McDonald\u2019s exploitative relationship to labor and the environment. Amazon might take a few items deemed offensive off its shelves, but it still relies on overworked and underpaid workers in its warehouses and delivery vehicles.", "Capital is capital, and, culture war agitation notwithstanding, the Republican Party is more than willing to back its interests when it matters most.", "The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
