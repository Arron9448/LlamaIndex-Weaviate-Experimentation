A few hours later, Chelsea followed, then Manchester City became the first to say so publicly. P\u00e9rez was supposed to be making a television appearance by then; he pulled out, reportedly because he was holding meetings with his fellow rebels.", "If he had tried to persuade them to hold the line, it did not work. The remaining English contingent \u2014 Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal \u2014 released nearly simultaneous statements just before 11 p.m. in Britain, confirming they were no longer involved. Only one of them, Arsenal, actually thought to apologize. Inter Milan bowed out soon after.", "An hour or so later, officials were confirming that the project was dead in the water. P\u00e9rez, on Spanish television Monday night, had fretted that young people did not have the attention span for soccer anymore. His solution to that problem, it turned out, had a half-life so brief a goldfish might have followed it.", "But it was not only how quickly it all dissipated \u2014 Sunday\u2019s future of soccer did not even make it to Wednesday \u2014 but how easily those who had designed it and signed on to it seemed to capitulate. It is not just that they lost the fans, the leagues, the broadcasters and the sponsors. It is that at no point did they seem interested in even trying to win them over.", "The prospect of a Super League has been the great Damoclean threat hanging over European soccer for the better part of two decades. It has been wheeled out without fail every two or three years, the trump card in each and every negotiation with UEFA \u2014 and others \u2014 to concentrate more money and more power in the hands of a select few.", "And yet, in the Super League\u2019s 48 hours of existence, only one of its architects spoke publicly: P\u00e9rez, giving an interview to \u201cEl Chiringuito,\u201d a gaudy, late-night Spanish sports talk show, the equivalent of announcing the onset of war on the shopping channel. In a way, he deserves a little credit for that, for the willingness to own his decision."], "authors": ["Rory Smith"], "keywords": ["p\u00e9rez", "league", "billionaires", "uefa", "wasnt", "soccer", "television", "leagues", "bluster", "super", "spanish", "publicly", "way", "manchester"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
