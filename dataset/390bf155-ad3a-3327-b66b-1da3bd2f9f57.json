And they hustle for it -- working odd jobs to make ends meet, sharing tiny apartments, huddling in long lines to audition for just a handful of highly coveted roles.", "But the brilliant lights of Broadway have been dark for nearly a year. And its 41 theaters, including iconic century-old ones like the Belasco, Lyceum and New Amsterdam, will likely remain closed for many months, despite ongoing discussions about potential safety measures, like a cap on audience sizes or requiring attendees to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test.", "The situation is dire for many of the 97,000 people who rely on Broadway for their livelihoods -- and for New York City, which benefits from the almost $15 billion generated by the industry each year, according to The Broadway League, a trade association representing producers and theater owners.", "View of the closed Richard Rogers Theater near Times Square on October 12, 2020 in New York City.

It's not just a job for us. This is our lives.\"", "Gabrielle McClinton, who was last seen on Broadway in the role of Annie in \"Chicago the Musical,\" echoes the heartbreak and hardship endured by many in New York's tightknit theater community.", "\"So many people have lost their jobs, and not just the actors, dancers, and singers (but also) the musicians, ushers and crew people. I know all my friends have been struggling, but they've been making it work by creating their own projects and kind of pivoting in different directions -- moving more into the TV and film realms,\" McClinton says.", "Reed's and McClinton's dedication to their craft has taken them to the other side of the world -- literally. Nearly ten thousand miles from Broadway, in Sydney, Australia, live theater is thriving. The city is one of the few places in the world where performances are open to the public.", "Pedestrians walk past the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia on January 14, 2021.

He and his husband Balmeet, a doctor in Los Angeles, have been apart for almost a year. But if Kelly leaves Australia, he won't be allowed to return, given that the country has banned entry to all non-residents since March of last year.", "\"I'm away from my family. I'm not at home.

People came to the show wearing their masks and we would get Covid-19 tested every week. When we (weren't) on stage, we were in our masks and everybody obeyed all the rules and we did our due diligence. And when we were outside the theater we made sure we weren't putting other people at risk,\" she says.", "\"(In Australia) people are making it work. I know it can work, because we did it.

But the tough measures -- including the imposition of curfews and strict curbs on social gatherings -- appear to have paid off, with local cases virtually eliminated.", "\"The reason why Sydney has been able to reopen is because people at local, state and federal levels took seriously the safety of the most vulnerable people in society.

Look, I'm an American. I'm over here (in Australia) and they're nailing it. So, try and get on board, even if it's not the most comfortable thing.
