I have to wait until I am cleared to go,\u201d he said.", "Roger White at the Eurotunnel terminal in Coquelles, near Calais, on Wednesday. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian", "He knew there was trouble ahead when he drove off the shuttle and the electronic display assigned him the orange lane instead of the green, indicating he would be subjected to an inspection by authorities.", "\u201cI think they are picking on the English trucks maybe,\u201d he said, as there was nothing wrong with the cheese. \u201cJust missing paperwork.\u201d Until it arrived, he would not be free to go.", "\u201cI am just waiting here. It is terrible \u2013 not good at all,\u201d he said.", "A driver for 48 years, White remembers what it was like before the single market in 1993 swept away the trade barriers that Brexit has re-erected.", "\u201cWe had customs checks before but it was so well organised on the border,\u201d he remembers. \u201cEverybody is learning as they go. You can do your preparations beforehand but it\u2019s not enough. All of this is new to everyone and unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it. We just have to get used to it,\u201d he said.", "Eurotunnel traffic is exceptionally low seven days after Brexit with drivers and exporters still avoiding the ports and Channel train services, partly because of pre-Brexit stockpiling and partly because business is conventionally quieter in the first two weeks of the new year.", "In normal times, 6,000 to 9,000 HGVs cross the Channel each day, but the Department for Transport said just over 2,000 HGVs crossed on 6 January, the day of the Guardian\u2019s visit, with \u201c90%\u201d of those trucks border-ready. It tested 1,081 drivers for Covid that day, with six coming back positive, bringing the number of tests carried out on drivers to 46,563 since the chaos on 23 December.", "Truck drivers Michael Delattre (left) and Benjamin Brogniart.

You wanted Brexit,\u201d he said.", "\u201cI got here at 6am,\u201d he added, putting his waiting time so far at six and a half hours. Again he has to wait until the freight owner sends over the correct customs paperwork to authorities stationed at the Eurotunnel border post.", "\u201cYou make the decisions at the last minute. They should have had this ready in the autumn and this would be running properly,\u201d he said.", "Alexandre Tronet.

Apart from teething problems, everything has gone very smoothly,\u201d said John Keefe, the director of public affairs.", "\u201cFor the few trucks that are stopped, we have our Eurotunnel border service to help them through the process. They meet the drivers on arrival, help them go through the paperwork or inspection and help them gather whatever documents are missing so that they can leave here as soon as possible. They also make sure the drivers, the haulage companies and the traders understand what was missing and what they need to have with them to avoid stopping next time.\u201d", "These maiden Brexit disruptions offer a glimpse of the potential for delays when traffic levels at Dover and Calais return to normal levels at the end of this month.

Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian", "On the other side of the channel, the UK has delayed the imposition of Brexit checks for six months: some of the lorry parks are not ready, nor is business, as the Brexit deal was only sealed on Christmas Eve.", "It has put in place mitigation measures to avert a repeat of the mayhem on Kent roads before Christmas. One of those is the Michael Gove-inspired Kent Access Permit (KAP) \u2013 being called the Brexit passport \u2013 which is issued electronically to trucks whose suppliers have to testify they have all their paperwork for the Channel crossing in order.", "The Cabinet Office said 18,000 KAPs had been issued so far and \u201caround 700 lorries have been turned away from the border\u201d with a further 150 fines handed out for non-compliance.", "\u201cOne of our guys was fined \u00a3300,\u201d said Delattre. The driver was caught not by police, but when he went to the Ashford HMRC park to get a Covid test, which are now mandatory before boarding either a train or ferry to France."], "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "keywords": ["stuck", "checks", "effects", "lorry", "brexit", "feel", "eurotunnel", "begin", "paperwork", "photograph", "calais", "driver", "levenethe", "david", "drivers", "im", "border"], "pubDate": "2021-01-08T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
