A proposal is usually a joyous moment, but Domenech\u2019s carried little romance for the French public. Having failed to break down a stubborn Romania team, been routed 4-1 by the Netherlands and finally beaten by Italy, Domenech\u2019s team had just finished bottom of their group at Euro 2008. Following a solemn post-match interview, live on French television, Domenech cringingly turned to the camera and proposed to his girlfriend, the journalist Estelle Denis. It summed up Domenech: jovial but somewhat bumbling with a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. After a decade in the coaching wilderness, Domenech is now back in Ligue 1. Has he finally picked the right moment?", "Domenech has not held a managerial role since he left the national team in 2010 \u2013 and his last club job was with Lyon in 1993 \u2013 so his return with a struggling Nantes team is a shock. The infamous player strike in support of Nicolas Anelka during the 2010 World Cup led to Domenech bizarrely reading a squad statement to the press, denouncing Anelka, the authorities and the squad for refusing to leave the team bus. After a disastrous exit, Domenech\u2019s career appeared ruined.", "He was given much of the blame and was vilified to such an extent that his three-year-old son asked: \u201cDad, are you going to prison?\u201d Domenech later joked: \u201cI was not France\u2019s public enemy number one; I was number two, behind Sarkozy.\u201d Eric Cantona later described Domenech as \u201cthe worst coach in French football since Louis XVI.\u201d", "Aim\u00e9 Jacquet, who led France to glory at the World Cup in 1998, said Domenech was the \u201cideal man at the right time\u201d when he was appointed to the job in 2004. Domenech had served as the France Under-21 coach for 11 years, where he had helped to nurture the generation of players who went on to win the World Cup and Euro 2000. But his eccentric, aloof and often deliberately contrary demeanour was soon ridiculed by the French press and public.", "He was derided for his trust in astrology \u2013 which reportedly influenced the dropping of Robert Pir\u00e8s \u2013 and use of tarot cards. \u201cWhen I have got a Leo in defence, I\u2019ve always got my gun ready as I know he\u2019s going to want to show off at one moment or another and cost us,\u201d Domenech famously said in reference to William Gallas in 2008.", "Domenech later denied the Pir\u00e8s story but defended his interest in astrology. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in anything that can help my understanding of how humans work.\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I had said \u2018I\u2019m doing graphology\u2019 no one would have picked up on it because it has a scientific side. But astrology has a mystical side and as soon as I mentioned it people started thinking I wear a wizard\u2019s hat on my head and gaze into crystal balls. Astrology has a value in finding out about people\u2019s character.\u201d", "Astrology aside, the 68-year-old\u2019s reputation for the unorthodox is well earned. Former Lyon player Gilles Rousset tells the story of Domenech refereeing practice matches in training and purposely only blowing for fouls for one of the teams \u201cto see how the guys reacted in the face of adversity\u201d. Domenech is obsessed with fitness and has already doubled the number of training sessions for his Nantes. Former Lyon defender Jean-Alain Boumsong remembers how the manager would \u201chide in trees during our jogging\u201d to ensure that no one took any shortcuts.", "Regardless of his eccentricities, strange training methods and the 2010 affair, Domenech is still the head of the French coaches\u2019 union and also garners respect. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best coaches I have had, in the knowledge of football,\u201d explained Boumsong. \u201cHe knows how to optimise the qualities of each player.\u201d Former France defender Philippe Mexes told L\u2019\u00c9quipe: \u201cHe was good at adapting our gameplan to that of the opponent. He had tons of information,\u201d Rousset insists Domenech \u201cknows football like no other \u2013 his image is not good, but everything else is good.\u201d", "Following the release of his autobiography in 2012 and his time as a TV pundit, public opinion towards him gradually softened. In his book Tout Seul (All Alone), he detailed the issues he encountered with a famously haughty and unruly generation of French players. So exasperated was Domenech that he called players \u201ca bunch of imbeciles,\u201d explaining that he had \u201chad enough of their tantrums.\u201d Domenech also recounts Anelka telling him to \u201cgo fuck yourself, you son of a bitch\u201d at half-time during the defeat to Mexico at the World Cup in South Africa. A survey by a TV company this week showed that 54% of people had forgiven Domenech for the 2010 farce while 61% agreed that he deserves a second chance.", "Nevertheless, despite long-standing rumours of interest from the explosive Nantes president Waldemar Kita, Domenech has only been given an initial six-month deal. Kita is as trigger happy as presidents come; Domenech is his 17th manager in 14 years. The club\u2019s fans, who are in a long-running battle with Kita, also remain skeptical about the appointment. After several furious protests, Nantes ultras blasted circus music across the training ground during Domenech\u2019s first session.", "Kita is no stranger to acrimony. He reportedly instructed the stadium announcer to drown out former coach Michel der Zakarian\u2019s farewell speech to fans with music from the Tannoy system in 2016. And his behaviour to officials during Nantes\u2019 defeat to PSG earlier this season earned him a touchline ban.", "Regardless, previous coach Christian Gourcuff oversaw Nantes\u2019 worst start in the Kita era, leaving the club worryingly close to the relegation zone after just two wins in his last 11 games. In truth, a relegation battle is about par for this poor Nantes squad. Lacking creativity and devoid of threat thanks to striker Kalifa Coulibaly\u2019s wayward recent form and the inability of winger Moses Simon to fulfil his initial promise after signing, Gourcuff may have gone sooner were it not for imposing defensive duo Nicolas Pallois and Andrei Girotto, plus cat-like keeper Alban Lafont.", "Having remarked after missing out on signing Jean Lucas from Lyon that \u201che is not here; he is at Brest... I would\u2019ve liked to sign Maradona, but he\u2019s dead. Life is like that,\u201d it\u2019s clear Domenech\u2019s offbeat personality persists, but he has also remained upbeat with the press and squad. The Nantes players have reacted well to Domenech\u2019s more nurturing presence after Gourcuff\u2019s disciplinarian approach. Captain Pallois said last week: \u201cEveryone agreed with the coach\u2019s speech. He talks to us, listens, with a smile.\u201d While L\u2019\u00c9quipe reported his teammates \u201conly had positive things to say\u201d and that early signs are promising. A battling opening display earned a creditable draw with Breton derby rivals Rennes in midweek before Imran Louza secured another valuable point at freewheeling Montpellier on Saturday.", "Despite that solid start, Domenech faces huge challenges. With a weak squad, a fiercely competitive division, irate fans and minimal transfer funds due to the ongoing financial crisis in French football, the marriage of the combustible Kita and the eccentric, rusty Domenech is far from perfect. As the packed press room for Domenech\u2019s unveiling underlines, his reign should be captivating but it could yet end with Nantes in Ligue 2.", "Ligue 1 results", "Quick Guide Ligue 1 results Show Bordeaux 2-1 Lorient", "Dijon 0-0 Marseille", "Metz 1-1 Nice", "Monaco 3-0 Angers", "Montpellier 1-1 Nantes", "Nimes 0-1 Lille", "PSG 3-0 Brest", "Lens 0-1 Strasbourg", "Reims 3-1 St Etienne", "Rennes 2-2 Lyon", "Talking points", "Pablo Sarabia scored PSG\u2019s third goal in their win over Brest. Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA", "\u2022 Mauricio Pochettino secured his first victory as PSG coach on Saturday night, although the 3-0 win over Brest was not as routine as the scoreline suggests. Much like Saint-\u00c9tienne in midweek, an exciting Brest side were often able to unbalance the PSG defence and it was an even contest for well over an hour, despite Moise Kean\u2019s first-half strike. It is still early in the Pochettino era and injuries remain an issue but balance remains elusive \u2013 as it did for Tuchel. A tired looking Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was underwhelming again, which is a concern.", "\u2022 Lyon are top of the table at the midway point in the season after producing a late fightback to earn a 2-2 draw against an improving Rennes team. Rennes put in a fluid, precise and positive display, with the rejuvenated Cl\u00e9ment Grenier orchestrating from midfield. Julian St\u00e9phan\u2019s team went two up through goals from Grenier and Benjamin Bourigeaud before a stunning volley from Memphis Depay in the 79th minute and a header from Jason Denayer three minutes later levelled the encounter. Having been outplayed, Rudi Garcia will see this as a point gained for Lyon.", "Ligue 1 table", "\u2022 This is an article from Get French Football News", "\u2022 Follow Adam White, Eric Devin and GFFN on Twitter"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["nantes", "team", "football", "ride", "coach", "game", "kita", "french", "domenechs", "raymond", "squad", "lyon", "domenech", "enjoy"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
