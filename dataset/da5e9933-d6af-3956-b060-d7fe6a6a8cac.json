The version below appears in the January 18, 2021, issue.", "Two hours into the siege of the U.S. Capitol, as another puff of tear gas wafted over the melee with police, Sharon Krahn, a grandmother from Dallas, looked on approvingly. \u201cOur congressmen should be shitting their pants. They need to fear, because they\u2019re too posh,\u201d she said.\u201cTheir jobs are too cush, and their personal gain has taken priority over their sense of duty. Maybe they all started off with a good heart, you know, but power corrupts. Our government is proof positive of that.\u201d", "She wore a plaid scarf and a gray wool hat, studded with sequins. I asked if the violence in front of us was going too far. \u201cWhose house is this? This is the house of \u2018We the People.\u2019 If you do a bad job, your boss tells you about it,\u201d Krahn said. She nodded toward the Senate, where the elected officials had already evacuated to safety: \u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the job you\u2019ve done.\u201d She drew a distinction between the scene in front of her and the domain of enemies she called \u201cAntifa and B.L.M.,\u201d who, she said, have \u201cno true aim except destruction and anarchy.\u201d", "The day had begun with a typical rant from the President\u2014a dejected, deluded improvisation about a stolen election, at a rally on the park south of the White House. But then it had turned. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Capitol,\u201d he told the crowd, a maskless confederacy of the rebellious, the devout, the bored, and the bitter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and give our Republicans . . . the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\u201d In other circumstances, it might have passed as his usual taunting, but, in this case, it was received as a call to arms.", "For anyone who has been to the U.S. Capitol, the scenes that followed were so unhinged that they took a moment to absorb. In the two decades since September 11th, much of the grounds of Congress has been encircled by rings of security. Now any sense of control was gone. The mob quickly overwhelmed the police, broke windows, and forced open doors. A jittery throng coursed through the Capitol, mugging with the statues and lounging at the desks of senators and representatives. They rummaged through drawers and brandished their loot for photographers. A man in a wool Trump hat with a pompom on it, his face in a rictus of glee, carried off a carved wooden lectern bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House.", "A leaderless scrum of hundreds, if not thousands, stood on the grand east staircase outside the Capitol, waving Trump flags. At the top of the stairs, a bald man in a white shirt and a Trump-style red tie shouted into a megaphone, \u201cOur world is broken, our system is broken.\u201d A man in camouflage at the base of the steps shouted back, \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d The man (who has not been identified) responded cryptically, \u201cI am a federal employee.\u201d An armored black SWAT-team truck, which is often posted at the foot of the stairs, had been left marooned in a sea of people. They stood on the roof and the hood and stuck a sign on the windshield that said \u201cPelosi is Satan.\u201d", "Police hung back, outnumbered and seemingly unsure how to respond. As the hours ticked toward 6 P.M.\u2014the start of a curfew announced by Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C.\u2014a white police van, led by a lone cop on a motorcycle, tried to part the crowd below the east stairs, but the crowd converged on it, banging on the metal walls of the van until the driver abandoned the attempt. The guy with the megaphone was still ranting: \u201cWe will not allow a new world order. . . . If you are truly innocent, you have nothing to worry about.\u201d According to police, five people died, including a woman who had been shot inside the Capitol and a police officer, and more than a dozen people were injured.", "I introduced myself to a hopped-up guy walking away from the Senate side of the Capitol, and he said, \u201cThe New Yorker? Fucking enemy of the people. Why don\u2019t I smash you in your fucking head?\u201d He made an effort to draw a crowd: \u201cRight there in the blue mask! Enemy of the fucking people!\u201d But the people had other things on their minds, and nobody bothered to join him.", "Five years after the Trump era began, a physical assault on American democracy felt both shocking and inevitable\u2014a culmination of everything that had been building since 2015. What else was there to say of him that had not already been said? How much darker could his America become in its final fourteen days? Would the sight of government brought so low, so vulnerable, break the spell\u2014or would it bring on another crescendo of fury?", "Trump\u2019s Presidency entered its last weeks as a strange concatenation of causes: those of doomsayers and Oath Keeper-style militias, QAnon and Falun Gong. Members of the Chinese spiritual movement, banned by Beijing, are deeply enmeshed in Trump World, and, as rioters picked through the U.S. Capitol, a caravan of cars outside displayed signs that announced \u201cSay no to CCP Chinese Communist Party\u201d and \u201cStop forced organ harvesting in China.\u201d A couple walked past the organ-harvesting sign, and the woman saw a resonance in her American cause: \u201cSee, that\u2019s what we don\u2019t want to get to.\u201d", "In the mob, a chant went up: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! When I met Krahn, the grandmother from Dallas, I asked if she thought Trump\u2019s victory had been stolen. \u201cAbsolutely, without a doubt,\u201d she said. Why? \u201cO.K.,\u201d she said, and started ticking things off on her fingers. \u201cThe vote count changing on TV, the more-votes-than-voters, boxes of blank ballots, and, honestly, probably the biggest one is the refusal to audit the votes. Because, if this was fair, if this was a legitimate election, then we should be above reproach. Just like when the I.R.S. comes in and audits my books, I don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d", "I asked where she got her news. \u201cYou have to be of a mind to dig through,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do not listen to mainstream media anymore. I like C-SPAN because I want to see it happen and then derive my own conclusions from it. I do subscribe to Epoch Times, and I do read articles from The New Yorker and The Atlantic, and I read the New York Times, and I read the Wall Street Journal, and I listen to NPR.\u201d She added, \u201cI do not listen to CNN, and I don\u2019t listen to Fox, because I\u2019ve lost all respect. Hate \u2019em all.\u201d", "Krahn\u2019s seventeen-year-old daughter, Annalee, wearing a wool Trump hat and thumbing out a message on her phone, approached with news. \u201cThey found more than one explosive device in the building. My sister just texted me,\u201d she said. Her mom was skeptical: \u201cI think they want to scare everybody and get everyone out of here.\u201d (According to law-enforcement officials, pipe bombs were found Wednesday outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees.)", "An hour or so later, after four o\u2019clock, word passed through the crowd that Trump had put out a video. Two women who had flown in from Seneca, Missouri, huddled around a cell phone to watch it. Sara Clark owns a gun store that makes custom AK-47s. Her friend Stacie Dunbar is a secretary in a hospital. On the cracked screen of Dunbar\u2019s phone, they watched Trump\u2019s video, a hasty production seemingly taped in the Rose Garden. \u201cI know your pain, I know you\u2019re hurt,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWe had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now; we have to have peace. We have to have law and order.\u201d", "What do you think? I asked.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do us any good to beat the hell out of everything. But we didn\u2019t lose. We shouldn\u2019t give in.\u201d", "What do you do now? I asked. Clark turned the question on her friend. \u201cI have no thoughts, honestly,\u201d Dunbar said. \u201cI\u2019m at an absolute loss. We\u2019re disenfranchised! It just sounded like he just gave up. Our President! Sounded like he just gave up. He gave in.\u201d", "Why? I asked.", "\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t want us to do this,\u201d Clark said, motioning toward the chaos.", "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anyone hurt. That\u2019s what he said,\u201d Dunbar added. Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI did this for my kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a son in the Navy, and Trump\u2019s done more for our military than any President ever has.\u201d", "What did you honestly expect would happen by coming here? I asked.", "\u201cA win! Four more years,\u201d Clark said, with a mirthless laugh.", "Seriously?", "\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI wanted Pence to do the right thing, but Pence didn\u2019t do the right thing,\u201d Dunbar said.", "As darkness approached, police fired a series of flash-bang grenades to shoo people down from the balconies and steps. A heavyset man in a white MAGA hat stood in a crosswalk, watching the crowd begin to move. He was happy. \u201cThey sent a message. That\u2019s enough,\u201d he said. He turned to walk away and added, \u201cOf course, if we come back, it will be with a militia.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Evan Osnos", "Evan Osno", "John Cassid", "Vinson Cunningha"], "keywords": ["capitol", "hat", "rule", "crowd", "white", "mob", "dont", "listen", "man", "know", "clark", "trump"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
