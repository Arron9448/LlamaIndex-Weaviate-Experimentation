In Athens it was memorable as the day the traffic went silent. Twenty-four hours into a hard lockdown, Greeks were acclimatising to a new reality in which they had to send an SMS to the government in order to leave the house. As well as millions of text messages, the Greek government faced extraordinary dilemmas. The European Union\u2019s most vulnerable economy, its oldest population along with Italy, and one of its weakest health systems faced the first wave of a pandemic that overwhelmed richer countries with fewer pensioners and stronger health provision. The carnage in Italy loomed large across the Adriatic.", "One Greek who did go into the office that day was Kyriakos Pierrakakis, the minister for digital transformation, whose signature was inked in blue on an agreement with the US technology company, Palantir. The deal, which would not be revealed to the public for another nine months, gave one of the world\u2019s most controversial tech companies access to vast amounts of personal data while offering its software to help Greece weather the Covid storm. The zero-cost agreement was not registered on the public procurement system, neither did the Greek government carry out a data impact assessment \u2013 the mandated check to see whether an agreement might violate privacy laws.", "The questions that emerge in pandemic Greece echo those from across Europe during Covid and show Palantir extending into sectors from health to policing, aviation to commerce and even academia. A months-long joint investigation by the Guardian, Lighthouse Reports and Der Spiegel used freedom of information laws, official correspondence, confidential sources and reporting in multiple countries to piece together the European activities of one of the most secretive companies in the world. The findings raise serious questions over the way public agencies work with Palantir and whether its software can work within the bounds of European laws in the sensitive areas where it is being used, or perform in the way the company promises.", "Greece was not the only country tempted by a Covid-related free trial.

The tone then abruptly changed.", "Eleftherios Chelioudakis, a data protection lawyer and member of digital rights group Homo Digitalis, was among the first people to read the two-page document and was stunned by what he found.

Worse, a revision of the agreement one week after the first deleted any reference to the need to \u201cpseudonymise\u201d the data \u2013 to prevent it being relatable to specific individuals. This appears to be in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU law in place since 2018 that governs how the personal information of people living in the EU can be collected and processed.
