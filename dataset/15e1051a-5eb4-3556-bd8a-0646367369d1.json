However, looking back on 2019 feels like surveying a landfill; all of the games that everyone told you were good were, in fact, not good. From bloated, big-budget blockbusters to desperation-fueled indie darlings, this was another year of universal disappointment. You are free to disagree with me \u2013 but you\u2019d be wrong, and I\u2019m going to explain why. Here are the many ways in which this year\u2019s popular games were bad, removing the factual basis for your enjoyment.", "10. Resident Evil 2", "Resident Evil 2 is a reimagining of an old PlayStation game, but with major changes and innovations. For example, the bad guy wears a hat now. However, fans will still find beloved elements intact, like clunky controls and cheap scares. Those legacy \u201cfeatures\u201d aren\u2019t diluted by the gritty atmosphere or gameplay strides that helped Resident Evil 7 revitalize the franchise and renew fans\u2019 interest. Naturally, Capcom scrapped that approach and went back to the formula that made Resident Evil stagnate in the first place.", "9. Control", "Anyone who tells you they like Control is lying. The story is impossibly weird and incoherent, but people are afraid to look stupid, so they pretend to understand it. Enemies called \u201cthe Hiss\u201d? Brilliant! An ashtray maze? Yes, moment of the year! Transforming weapons? Sure, makes sense! Control is basically what the Men in Black movies would be if no one edited them \u2013 and all of this strangeness serves as a diversion to distract players from the lackluster gunplay and budget-grade Jedi mind tricks.", "8. The Outer Worlds", "This game doesn\u2019t blow your hair back with good graphics, inventive quest design, or a massive world. Instead, the team at Obsidian focuses on one thing: avoiding catastrophic failure. As long as The Outer Worlds didn\u2019t actively alienate players with technical disasters and bad ideas (like Mass Effect Andromeda and Fallout 76 did), it could have scraped by as a mere archaic echo of better games and still be celebrated as a savior \u2013 which is exactly what happened. \u201cIt didn\u2019t poison my love for sci-fi RPGs\u201d is the highest praise The Outer Worlds deserves.", "7. Disco Elysium", "Among the many forms of entertainment available today, only games offer a unique interactive element that makes stories come alive. No title illustrates that like Disco Elysium. Truly, what other media allows you to sit quietly for hours as you read text? Well, okay, books do that \u2026 but when have you ever seen a book weave a compelling murder mystery? Oh, right, that\u2019s a whole literary genre. At least Disco Elysium stars a damaged, drug-addicted detective \u2013 good luck finding that character type anywhere else!", "6. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice", "Do you get mad when too many other people enjoy the games you also enjoy? Then you will love Sekiro because hardly anyone can tolerate its obtuse design and punishing mechanics. If you can convince yourself these are actually good things then Sekiro may be your favorite From Software game ever. Trimming away boring elements like cool gear and flexible character progression, this adventure requires pure skill, determination, and a gnawing hunger for validation from strangers online.", "5. World of Warcraft Classic", "World of Warcraft originally launched over 15 years ago. In the time since then, the team at Blizzard has been working to improve the experience with a multitude of updates and expansions. And yet, players ignored those and flocked to WoW Classic \u2013 an ancient snapshot of MMO history full of generic quests and grindy progression. The lesson here is this: Developers should stop trying to iterate and improve their games. Instead, they should just release one thing, then release the same exact thing 15 years later while cowering behind nostalgia.", "4. Apex Legends", "This popular battle royale (no, not that one) is full of quirky characters who team up to claim victory. After making an initial splash after its surprise announcement and release, people eventually realized that Apex Legends is not Titanfall 3, and then the hype dwindled. But if your favorite battle royale is having a black-hole event or something, well, then you should probably play PUBG or Call of Duty\u2019s Blackout mode instead. But if those servers are also down, Apex Legends is a game that works.", "3. Pok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield", "Look. It\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon.", "2. Fire Emblem: Three Houses", "As a new professor at an elite military academy, your time in Fire Emblem: Three Houses is all about strategy, character development, and having creepy tea parties with your underage students. The game tells an epic tale that you need to play through three times if you want to see the story from all angles. However, if you have 100 hours to spare for that, maybe you should volunteer for your local school district instead of trying to make a difference in the lives of fake students.", "1. Untitled Goose Game", "People just will not shut up about how charming this game is. Don\u2019t be fooled. You stumble around colorful and cartoony worlds, but that\u2019s where the fun stops. The story makes absolutely no sense and is prohibitively complex for a game that\u2019s just supposed to be a romp about a mischievous goose. Plus, this so-called \u201cgoose\u201d is actually a duck, and he isn\u2019t even the main character. Instead, you control some spikey-haired doofus who \u2013 while still very annoying \u2013 is not the hilarious kind of annoying. Kids might think it\u2019s a good game, though."], "authors": ["Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Darth Clark Is The Totally Real Editor-In-Chief Of Game Infarcer", "Which Appears Annually In Game Informer", "Usually Around April Fool S Day .
