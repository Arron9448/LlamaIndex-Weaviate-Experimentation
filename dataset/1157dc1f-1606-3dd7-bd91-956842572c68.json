You\u2019ll paddle under striking rock arches and into mysterious sea caves. There are a few hours in the afternoon to spend as you wish. Drinking coffee and people-watching in Amalfi\u2019s piazzas is time well spent. And it\u2019ll trump your usual coffee break. Later, you\u2019ll take a private bus to the clifftop town of Ravello. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether you want to venture inside Villa Cimbrone with its elegant gardens and sea views. Or you can wander the town\u2019s piazzas and lanes. Next, there\u2019s a visit to a local limoncello factory, with an opportunity to sample this zesty beverage made with the famous local lemons.
