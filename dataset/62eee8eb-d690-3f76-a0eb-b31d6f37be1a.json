It follows years of development and delays as the United States has sought to revive its human spaceflight program through private partnerships.", "NASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing [BA.N] and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil for the first time since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011.", "The space agency has since relied on Russian spacecraft to hitch rides to the space station.", "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "In the test, the Falcon 9 rocket's boosters will shut down roughly 12 miles (19 km) above the ocean, a mock failure that will trigger Crew Dragon's so-called SuperDraco thrusters to jet itself away at supersonic speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kph).", "The capsule will deploy three parachutes to slow its descent to water, carrying aboard two human-shaped test dummies dressed in motion sensors to collect valuable data on the immense g-force \u2014 the effect of acceleration on the body \u2014 imposed during abort.", "The booster will free-fall and tumble back uncontrollably toward the ocean, SpaceX's Crew Mission Management director Benji Reed said. \"At some point we expect that the Falcon will start to break up.\"", "\"Our Falcon 9 recovery forces will be standing by ready to go and recover as much of the Falcon as we can as safely as possible,\" Reed said.", "CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "The in-flight abort test was originally scheduled to take place in mid-2019, but the timeline was delayed by nine months after one of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsules exploded in April on a test stand just before firing its launch abort thrusters, triggering a lengthy investigation.", "SpaceX zeroed in on a previously unknown explosive reaction between a titanium valve and the capsule's rocket fuel.
