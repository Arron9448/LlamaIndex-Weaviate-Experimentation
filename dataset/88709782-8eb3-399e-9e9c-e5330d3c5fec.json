But in the age of coronavirus, who wants to jostle for 60 lifts with 12,000 others?", "With the City of London deserted once more, its streets only populated by the occasional Deliveroo driver or tumbleweed-seeking photographer, it seems a strange time to be completing the largest office building the capital has ever seen, not least because the very future of the workplace is now in question.", "But, rising far above the Cheesegrater and the Walkie-Talkie, dwarfing the now fun-sized Gherkin and boasting the floor area of almost all three combined, 22 Bishopsgate stands as the mother of all office towers. It is the City\u2019s menacing final boss, a glacial hulk that fills its plot to the very edges and rises directly up until it hits the flight path of passing jets. The building muscles into every panorama of London, its broad girth dominating the centre of the skyline and congealing the Square Mile\u2019s distinctive individual silhouettes into one great, grey lump.", "It is the absurdist conclusion of three decades of steroidal growth, the final product of superheated land values stretching loose planning rules to breaking point. And, just as the building is being handed over to its first tenants to fit out, it feels like a monument from another epoch. Remember when we used to commute to the office?", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gargantuan \u2026 Apple is buildng an HQ in the former Battersea Power Station. Photograph: Chris Gorman/Getty Images", "\u201cTwenty-two Bishopsgate reminds me of a catchphrase from the 1960s sitcom, The Rag Trade,\u201d says Peter Rees, former chief planner of the City of London. \u201cNever mind the quality, feel the width!\u201d Rees oversaw the transformation of the City from the mid-1980s until 2014, summoning ever-larger structures into being, but he left his post shortly before this tower was granted permission. \u201cI wasn\u2019t responsible for that one,\u201d he says. \u201cThankfully, I think it marks the end of an era of buildings of that intensity, the idea that more is better.\u201d Certainly, post-Covid, the big question seems to be: will people want to commute to a mega-building and jostle for the lifts with 12,000 others?", "The beast of Bishopsgate, nicknamed The Wodge by one critic, may be the last gasp of this generation of inflated totems, but it is by no means alone. It heralds a flood of new office space at a time when it could hardly look less needed. Across London, some of the biggest corporate HQs ever built in the UK are under construction, from Google\u2019s sprawling, ground-scraping Goliath in King\u2019s Cross, to Apple\u2019s gargantuan new home inside the zombified cadaver of Battersea Power Station. And those are just the giants. According to a recent report by Deloitte, over 15 million square feet of office space is on the way in central London. That\u2019s the equivalent of 30 Gherkins, a peak of activity last reached in 2008, just as the bubble burst.", "Twenty million people can get to our building within an hour \u2013 and many are yearning to get back to the office", "The City bounced back from the financial crisis, but this tidal wave comes as the country is facing the worst economic recession for 300 years \u2013 along with speculation that the nature of work might have changed for ever. Google itself has extended home-working until at least July, while investment bank Morgan Stanley has predicted that the number of people working from home will more than double to 30% by 2030.", "Deloitte\u2019s research also found that, compared to other European countries, UK employees are the least willing to return to their offices, with 72% saying they will work remotely more often in the future. The market is reflecting this uncertainty: central London office take-up plummeted in the six months to September, with the latest quarter the lowest on record. Just as factories and mills were converted into luxury lofts, and postwar offices converted into grim bedsits, might today\u2019s glass office towers be the high-rise homes of tomorrow?", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Get a grip \u2026 the climbing window on the 25th floor of 22 Bishopsgate. Photograph: Miller Hare/22 Bishopsgate", "\u201cCity-centre offices are the product of a 10,000-year trend,\u201d says Harry Badham of AXA IM Real Assets, the firm behind 22 Bishopsgate, which is already around 60% pre-let. \u201cWe are a long-term investor, so we take the long view. People work better together. That\u2019s how cities were created and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change overnight. Twenty million people can get to our building within an hour, and many are yearning to get back to the office.\u201d", "With 1.3m sq ft of space and a whopping 60 lifts, the tower\u2019s first occupants will at least have enough room to be socially distanced, whether they\u2019re relaxing in the nail bar on the 41st floor or scaling the precipitous \u201cclimbing window\u201d on the 25th. But the prospect of being trapped inside this \u201cvertical village\u201d \u2013 with restaurants, bars, gym and even a GP\u2019s surgery \u2013 might not be quite the draw it once was. Do you want your work life to be permanently \u201ccoached and curated\u201d? Are all these communal facilities \u2013 such as Google HQ\u2019s swimming pool, massage rooms, basketball court and nap pods \u2013 really the future?", "Rees believes that \u2013 having survived the Black Death, the Great Fire and the Blitz \u2013 the Square Mile will bounce back", "\u201cGiant buildings that try to internalise the place are making a big mistake,\u201d says Rees, now professor of planning at University College London. \u201cThe most important places in the City are outdoors and the pandemic has certainly taught us that. People need to get out of the office to get the gossip and bring it back to the beehive. That proximity, and those face-to-face encounters, have been the foundation of doing business here since medieval times.\u201d Rees thinks that, having survived the Black Death, the Great Fire, the Blitz and the banking crashes, the Square Mile will soon bounce back even stronger from the impact of Covid-19. \u201cThe City has always been adapting and reforming,\u201d he says. \u201cIts only constant is change.\u201d", "Ziona Strelitz, a social anthropologist and veteran workplace consultant, thinks the pandemic will provide a wake-up call for businesses, forcing them to reconsider how they use their costly premises. And this may bring a welcome end to wasteful interior fads. \u201cThe last decade,\u201d she says, \u201chas seen an explosion in so-called \u2018new ways of working\u2019, with offices equipped with informal meeting spaces, chill-out rooms, libraries and coffee bars. These settings were a huge liberation for interior designers: they could stop doing serried rows of desks and introduce some photogenic funk. But there wasn\u2019t the correlate reduction in the number of desks elsewhere. As a result, offices are vastly underoccupied most of the time \u2013 about 50% occupancy or less, pre-pandemic. Now it\u2019s even lower.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Groundscraper \u2026 a drawing of Google\u2019s new UK HQ, under construction in King\u2019s Cross. Photograph: HayesDavidson", "She mentions a large telecoms provider she worked with, whose staff moved from a huge, award-winning, grade-A office building to a series of smaller, converted former technical spaces \u2013 and they were happier as a result. \u201cThey knew everyone on their floor and were no longer rattling around in the Mary Celeste,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could actually walk over and speak to someone.\u201d", "Strelitz thinks the biggest impact of Covid-19 will be that companies contract their holdings and use space more efficiently, a view echoed by Deloitte\u2019s prediction of a 15% reduction in demand. \u201cIt\u2019s not the death of the office,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s hopefully the end of offices growing exponentially.\u201d And the fate of the collaborative beer-tap-ping-pong-bean-bag-lounge? \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit of a nonsense. These spaces don\u2019t bear a relationship to how people actually choose to work. Collaboration happens in the immediacy of a horizontal surface and two bums.\u201d", "She agrees with Rees that a hybrid new space is likely to emerge, somewhere between the home and the office, where you can escape from the kitchen table laptop grind, without enduring the daily commute. We are likely to see a rise in shared neighbourhood offices, perhaps taking over vacant shop units on the high street or former department stores, which would be no bad thing. \u201cPeople want the buzz of work around them,\u201d says Rees, \u201cthe chance to network with individuals doing something very different. That\u2019s why even large corporations started taking space in co-working buildings like WeWork. They realised they could eavesdrop on a lot of other people\u2019s creative ideas.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Networking \u2026 a WeWork meeting room at No 1 Poultry, in the City. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images", "Across London, many of the big landlords have been following WeWork\u2019s lead, leasing space to smaller outfits on a more flexible basis, rather than looking for major anchor tenants. Despite hawking the biggest office in the capital, Harry Badham admits that the future of the workplace is smaller tenants leasing smaller spaces. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we want to be the only landlord in London to lease you less space,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the communal facilities for the whole building so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d", "The pandemic has severely tested the co-working business model, though, given how tightly desks are usually packed in, but the fall in demand has also been offset by businesses looking for temporary accommodation as a result of the uncertainty. Despite its financial troubles, WeWork remains the biggest office occupier in both London and New York.", "For all the talk about a remote-working future, the death of the office, the freedom of moving to the country, or even working from a roaming van, there remains a huge generational divide in the experience of working from home. A recent study by ISG found that millennials and generation Z (people born since the early 1980s) were least happy and suffering the most, with a third saying productivity had fallen and almost two-thirds complaining of poor home-working conditions.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zoom culture \u2026 younger employees in particular report poor working conditions and productivity at home.

In November, the City of London Corporation received more planning applications than the same month last year, meaning incoming proposals are now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. \u201cEver since I started directing City planning in the 1980s,\u201d says Rees, \u201cjournalists were telling me that most people will be working from home within 10 years, thanks to the telephone, fax and then the internet. But the more that technology invaded people\u2019s jobs, the more they wanted to come face to face to bounce ideas off each other, or learn if they could trust one other.\u201d As the pandemic has shown, you can\u2019t really gossip on a group Zoom.", "It looks like those predicting the implosion of the office might have to cancel their dreams of squatting the City, co-opting Canary Wharf, and turning all these gleaming glass towers into high-rise greenhouses.
