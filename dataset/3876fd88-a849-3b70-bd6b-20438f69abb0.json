While living in Germany, von Braun was involved in the Nazi rocket development program. He later worked on the Apollo space program in the United States.", "The name was voted for by the Gateway Foundation members because the station is based on designs von Braun sketched out some 60 years ago.", "\"The basic physics of the station haven't changed since the 1950s, the way the station rotates,\" says Alatorre.", "The main difference is the modern materials -- new metal alloys, carbon composites, 3D printing and launch pad technology that, says Alatorre, make a space hotel more probable in our current era.", "What the space hotel might look like inside.
