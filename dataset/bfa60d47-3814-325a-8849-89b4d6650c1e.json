But the director Marielle Heller was willing to go out. Like Fred Rogers, the subject of her new film, \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\u201d starring Tom Hanks, she wore a comfy sweater, although she made no ceremony of changing into her outdoor shoes. The neighborhood was Carroll Gardens, where Heller lives in a brownstone with her husband, the comedian and director Jorma Taccone, and their five-year-old, Wylie. \u201cEveryone\u2019s, like, \u2018How many kids do you have?\u2019 \u201d Heller said, gesturing to the avalanche of toys around the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m, like, \u2018Just one.\u2019 \u201d", "To prep for the film, Heller watched hours of \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d with Wylie. \u201cHe likes the parts when Mister Rogers is in his house, and he didn\u2019t like when he goes to the Land of Make-Believe, which is how I remember feeling. I was scared of some of the puppets\u2014Lady Elaine particularly.\u201d She put on a trolley-print raincoat, a gift from the producers. Heller, who is forty, with a copper-colored pixie cut, met Hanks several years ago, at a birthday party in Los Angeles for one of his grandchildren. (She\u2019s friends with his son Colin.) Hanks promised to check out her first film, \u201cThe Diary of a Teenage Girl.\u201d A few days later, he sent her an e-mail that wound up in her spam folder. Hanks had declined the \u201cBeautiful Day\u201d screenplay several times, but when Heller became attached to direct he changed his mind. \u201cI thought I would only make movies about women,\u201d she said on the sidewalk, but Rogers \u201crepresents a totally different kind of masculinity that we don\u2019t get to see onscreen.\u201d", "On Court Street, she sat in a seventy-year-old coffee shop and ordered an omelette. \u201cThere\u2019s usually a group of people here who call themselves the Leftovers\u2014the people from before the neighborhood gentrified, who come and hold court,\u201d she said. Heller has a knack for malcontents; her previous film, \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?,\u201d starred Melissa McCarthy as a grouchy literary forger. \u201cBeautiful Day\u201d views Fred Rogers through the eyes of a cynical journalist assigned to profile him for Esquire. \u201cIt\u2019s two halves of myself,\u201d Heller explained. \u201cIf you met my parents, you\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, yeah, it\u2019s my mom and my dad.\u2019 \u201d She was raised in the Bay Area, by her mother, a sweet-natured grade-school art teacher, and her father, a chiropractor and \u201csarcastic New York Jew.\u201d \u201cFor most of my life, I\u2019ve been more like my dad. But there\u2019s a lot of me that\u2019s also similar to Fred, I\u2019ve discovered.\u201d", "Had living with Mister Rogers in her head made her nicer? \u201cIt\u2019s not just being nice,\u201d she clarified. \u201cIt\u2019s being honest. There\u2019s this idea that he\u2019s just kind and nice no matter what, but he was challenging to the people around him, almost aggressively intimate.\u201d When Wylie was three, Heller showed him a 1970 episode in which Rogers buries his pet goldfish and explains death, sharing a story about losing his childhood dog. \u201cWylie looked at me, like, \u2018Dogs don\u2019t die!\u2019 \u201d Heller recalled. \u201cAnd I was thinking about Mister Rogers\u2014you tell kids the truth, but you let them lead it. And I said, \u2018Well, dogs do die. And cats die.\u2019 And he went, \u2018What? Cats die? But we have great cats!\u2019 \u201d She showed him a photo of a previous cat she had buried in the back yard. \u201cI said, \u2018I like to believe that if I miss him I can go visit him.\u2019 He kept watching the show, and then a few minutes later he turned to me, with tears growing in his eyes, and said, \u2018Do walruses die?\u2019 \u201d", "It wasn\u2019t until bedtime that night that Wylie asked whether people die, and when Heller told him the truth he was inconsolable. At the time, she was going through a cancer scare and had just had thyroid surgery. \u201cA few weeks later, we went to Pittsburgh for the first time\u201d\u2014Mister Rogers\u2019s real-life neighborhood\u2014\u201cand he asked me about my surgery in ways he had never asked me before. He asked if they had taken my head off. He had been thinking about that for a month. It was obviously what Mister Rogers knew could happen, but he also knew what was important was for us to be present with our kids and their dark feelings.\u201d", "She sipped her coffee. That morning, Heller had walked Wylie to school and then checked her messages\u2014the Golden Globe nominations were just out, and her publicist had texted the news: \u201cAll men for director again.\u201d \u201cI was, like, Yeah, that\u2019s what I expected,\u201d Heller said. \u201cI think the unconscious bias is strong. I don\u2019t look like a director to people.\u201d Her phone buzzed with a commiserating text from Greta Gerwig, who had also been left out, for \u201cLittle Women.\u201d \u201cHollywood is the Land of Make-Believe for me,\u201d Heller said, and added, under her breath, \u201cThe Land of Bullshit and Make-Believe.\u201d \u2666"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/marielle-hellers-land-of-make-believe", "id": "bfa60d47-3814-325a-8849-89b4d6650c1e", "title": "Marielle Heller\u2019s Land of Make-Believe", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "But the director Marielle Heller was willing to go out.\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, \u2018Just one.\u2019 \u201dTo prep for the film, Heller watched hours of \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d with Wylie.\n\u201cHe likes the parts when Mister Rogers is in his house, and he didn\u2019t like when he goes to the Land of Make-Believe, which is how I remember feeling.\nBut there\u2019s a lot of me that\u2019s also similar to Fred, I\u2019ve discovered.\u201dHad living with Mister Rogers in her head made her nicer?\nIt was obviously what Mister Rogers knew could happen, but he also knew what was important was for us to be present with our kids and their dark feelings.\u201dShe sipped her coffee.", "pubDate": null}
