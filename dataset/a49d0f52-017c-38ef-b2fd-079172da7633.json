It didn\u2019t matter back then that studies consistently found that whites were equally likely, if not more likely, than people of color to use and sell illegal drugs. Black people were still labeled the enemy. Nor did it matter, when the drug war was taking off, that nearly all of the sensationalized claims that crack cocaine was some kind of \u201cdemon drug,\u201d drastically more harmful than powder cocaine, were false or misleading. Black people charged with possession of crack in inner cities were still punished far more harshly than white people in possession of powder cocaine in the suburbs. And it didn\u2019t matter that African-Americans weren\u2019t actually taking white people\u2019s jobs or college educations in significant numbers through affirmative action programs.", "Getting tough on \u201cthem\u201d \u2014 the racially defined \u201cothers\u201d who could easily be used as scapegoats and cast as the enemy \u2014 was all that mattered. Facts were treated as largely irrelevant then. As they are now.", "Fortunately, a growing number of scholars and activists have begun to connect the dots between mass incarceration and mass deportation in our nation\u2019s history and current politics. The historian Kelly Lytle Hern\u00e1ndez, in her essay \u201cAmnesty or Abolition: Felons, Illegals, and the Case for a New Abolition Movement,\u201d chronicles how these systems have emerged as interlocking forms of social control that relegate \u201caliens\u201d and \u201cfelons\u201d to a racialized caste of outsiders. In recent decades, the system of mass incarceration has stripped away from millions of U.S. citizens basic civil and human rights until their status mirrors (or dips below) that of noncitizen immigrants within the United States. This development has coincided with the criminalization of immigration in the United States, resulting in a new class of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and \u201caliens\u201d who are viewed and treated like \u201cfelons\u201d or \u201ccriminals.\u201d Immigration violations that were once treated as minor civil infractions are now crimes. And minor legal infractions, ranging from shoplifting to marijuana possession to traffic violations, now routinely prompt one of the nation\u2019s most devastating sanctions \u2014 deportation.", "The story of how our \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d came to deport and incarcerate so many for so little, Hern\u00e1ndez explains, is a story of race and unfreedom reaching back to the era of emancipation. If we fail to understand the historical relationship between these systems, especially the racial politics that enabled them, we will be unable to build a truly united front that will prevent the continual re-formation of systems of racial and social control.", "In my experience, those who argue that the systems of mass incarceration and mass deportation simply reflect sincere (but misguided) efforts to address the real harms caused by crime, or the real challenges created by surges in immigration, tend to underestimate the corrupting influence of white supremacy whenever black and brown people are perceived to be the problem. \u201cBetween me and the other world, there is ever an unasked question,\u201d W.E.B. Du Bois famously said back in 1897: \u201cHow does it feel to be a problem?\u201d White people are generally allowed to have problems, and they\u2019ve historically been granted the power to define and respond to them. But people of color \u2014 in this \u201cland of the free\u201d forged through slavery and genocide \u2014 are regularly viewed and treated as the problem."], "authors": ["Michelle Alexander"], "keywords": ["mass", "incarceration", "possession", "aberration", "white", "systems", "problem", "matter", "moment", "opinion", "injustice", "treated", "united", "immigration"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
