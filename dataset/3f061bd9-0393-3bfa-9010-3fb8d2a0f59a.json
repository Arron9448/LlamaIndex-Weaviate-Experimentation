Trey Hollingsworth (R, Ind.).", "The Current Expected Credit Losses rule, known as CECL, requires lenders to record expected future losses as soon as loans are issued. The rule was adopted in 2016 and started to go into effect for large public banks on Dec. 15. FASB in October delayed the rule\u2019s effective start date for private and nonprofit lenders until after Dec. 15, 2022.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "Before CECL, lenders didn\u2019t have to recognize losses until they had evidence the losses had been incurred. FASB, which sets U.S. accounting standards, changed the rule to provide investors with more transparency about the loan-issuing process.", "As part of the rule-change process, FASB conducted a cost-benefit analysis that sought to determine whether the new standard would produce clearer information for investors and minimal long-term costs for companies.", "But lawmakers on Wednesday said they wanted to know why FASB didn\u2019t conduct a broader analysis to determine whether the new rule would affect consumers and to what extent it might spur an economic downturn.", "Mr. Golden said that it wasn\u2019t FASB\u2019s responsibility to conduct such a review, adding that it should be left to the U.S. Treasury to conduct an economic analysis. He noted FASB plans to study the post-implementation effect of the rule on companies and investors.", "Mr. Golden also defended the process by which FASB changes rules. FASB sought public feedback about the change and, as a result, was criticized by some banks that said the need to book losses up front would discourage lending.", "\u201cNot every stakeholder agrees with every decision,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cBut all have a seat at the table.\u201d", "Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and the House introduced bills last year to delay CECL and study the standard\u2019s potential effects, but those bills haven\u2019t advanced beyond referrals to committees.", "The House subcommittee, which also questioned Public Company Accounting Board Chairman William Duhnke, didn\u2019t identify any specific legislation at its oversight hearing.", "In his first hearing as chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Brad Sherman (D, Calif.) said it would next invite accounting professors to discuss the credit-loss standard. Mr. Sherman, an accountant, said he expects to make accounting rules and regulation a larger focus of the subcommittee.", "The Committee on Financial Services\u2019s future activities aren\u2019t confirmed until Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the committee\u2019s chairwoman, issues an announcement and the committee issues an official notice.", "Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com"], "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "keywords": ["rules", "economic", "rep", "standard", "creditloss", "accounting", "losses", "lawmakers", "press", "rule", "maker", "golden", "chairman", "standards", "fasb", "impact", "subcommittee"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e"}
