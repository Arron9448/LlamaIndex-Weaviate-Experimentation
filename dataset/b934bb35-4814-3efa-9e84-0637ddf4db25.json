(That said, I did really like Amy Poehler\u2019s Wine Country.)", "In this age of experiential and photo-op-driven journeying, more and more travelers are looking to find the unexpected in their winery and wine region visits; many are not necessarily all about the grapes. Here, we\u2019ve rounded up five vineyard and wine region trips that go well beyond the routine. Whether with ultra-luxurious, wellness-focused days in California, a combination of viticulture and architecture in Italy, or the world\u2019s highest-altitude grape vines in Argentina, these winemaking destinations promise tastings\u2014and trips\u2014to remember.", "Newton Vineyard, St. Helena, California, USA", "Newton Vineyard, located in St. Helena, California, is a unique location for the Napa Valley region. The property is owned by the French luxury conglomerate LVMH, but the feel is far from corporate. Nestled along a leafy ribbon in the Mayacamas mountain range, Newton\u2019s (soon to be certified organic) wine-making process is as exacting as it gets; their viticulture specialists track each individual plant, with dozens of alternating exposures (some cooler, some higher, some sunnier, some drier) to create exceptional Cabernet blends. The St. Helena acreage is called Spring Mountain; the vineyard also owns other sites, but this is its most photogenic. It gives you California splendor, but with hyper-varied terrain; every crest offers a new, impressive vista (make sure your phone has space; you\u2019ll be taking hundreds of photos). Clos 19\u2014LVMH\u2019s wine and spirits vendor, which also curates exclusive outings around the company\u2019s alcohol portfolio\u2014has a recently introduced \u201cNewton Experience,\u201d which is bookable from May to October each year. With it, guests will enjoy more than just sipping on delicious red blends or Newton\u2019s renowned unfiltered Chardonnay; the day on Spring Mountain will also include hilltop meditation and yoga, honey-harvesting, a full-spread picnic lunch catered by a Michelin-star chef, \u201ccave\u201d (cellar) tours, and the opportunity to hike the roads and trails of this extraordinary estate (if you\u2019re not up for traveling by foot, a teal vintage Land Rover Defender will be your mode of transport). And, yes, there\u2019s a complete wine-tasting portion from an awning-shaded perch overlooking the Northern Napa Valley. It\u2019s indulgent heaven on rarefied earth.", "Rocca di Frassinello, Gavorrano, Italy", "Rocca di Frassinello is a coastal Tuscan vineyard comprising approximately 500 hectares of hillside splendor. An anomaly for the area, it grows 50% Italian and 50% French variety grapes, which are all blended, save for the vineyard\u2019s flagship (and delicious) Baffonero, which is 100% Merlot. And at this site, great wine stands alongside great architecture: Rocca di Frassinello\u2019s main building and its enormous inverted-pyramid wine cellar are designed by the world renowned Renzo Piano. As you wind your way up the gently sloping land, a unique edifice comes into view: gridded, angular overhangs provide shade on expansive terraces, while a chimney-like structure painted in burnt sienna stands as a striking monolith against the greenery below and the wide-ranging blue skies above. Once you\u2019ve wrapped your mind around all that (and tasted some wine), head to nearby Punta Ala for a stay at the quaint Baglioni Resort Cala del Porto, tucked on a hilltop looking west over the Tyrrhenian Sea. Starchitecture and standout wine: an unlikely yet unforgettable combo.", "Cinque Terre, Italy", "Cinque Terre, a string of towns located on the Italian Riviera, is an area well known for its sun, sea, and spectacular vignettes (as well as being a quieter option when compared to nearby Portofino and Forte dei Marmi or other Italian coastal ports of call). Less recognized\u2014though no less impressive\u2014is Cinque Terre\u2019s local wine industry, which specializes in two white varieties: the eponymous Cinque Terre and the dessert wine Sciacchetr\u00e0. Spend the day working up an appetite and a thirst by hiking the vertiginous hills (the steeply terraced vines, juxtaposed against the turquoise water, are ultra-picturesque), then sample the area\u2019s fresh seafood with both types. Cinque Terre is often light and crisp, with a flowery or mineral taste; Sciacchetr\u00e0 is derived from the same blend as Cinque Terre, but solely from grapes grown closest to the sea. Only small quantities are produced; the most impressive thing about both is that their production is done entirely by hand. Harvesting on Cinque Terre\u2019s stony cliff sides takes extreme patience and precision. The payoff is well worth it.", "Colom\u00e9, Calchaqui Valley, Argentina", "The world\u2019s highest vineyards are located in the Colom\u00e9 winery of Salta province in northern Argentina. In Colom\u00e9, some grapes grow at over 10,000 feet above sea level. (Drink a ton of water if you\u2019re heading here, not only to offset a hangover, but also to combat altitude sickness). There are two standout grapes in Colom\u00e9: Malbec, Argentina\u2019s most famous type, and Torront\u00e9s. Jagged mountains surround this region, soaring even higher into the deep Southern hemisphere sky. Plus, there\u2019s an entirely unexpected attraction outside of viticulture: the world\u2019s only museum dedicated to the space and light artist James Turrell, which is funded by the Hess family (they own a majority of the vineyard operations in the area). The museum holds nine of Turrell\u2019s immersive light pieces, including his biggest \u201cSkyscape,\u201d which is called Unseen Blue. The sunken installation has an opening to the outdoors above, which provides an intense, completely mesmerizing sunrise and sunset-hour light show, replete with Turrell\u2019s signature gradient, soothing illumination (sadly no Malbec is allowed inside).", "Katsunuma Winery, Koshu, Japan", "If you\u2019re visiting Tokyo\u2014perhaps during next year\u2019s Summer Olympics\u2014a day trip to the Katsunuma Winery in Yamanashi Prefecture should be in order. This vineyard grows local Koshu grapes over approximately 70 acres; visitors say tastings are unlike anything they\u2019ve tried in the United States, and that the experience is singular (though the wine itself is reported to be an acquired taste). Yamanashi is a wooded, quiet area at the southern end of the Japanese alps; it is a beautiful escape from Tokyo\u2019s hustle and, if you\u2019re lucky, Mount Fuji will be fully on display, smog and haze-free. For those who are also into spirits: drive one hour further west and you\u2019ll reach the forest-swathed Suntory Hakushu Distillery, a world famous production site for ultra-fine Japanese whiskey."], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Nick Remsen"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/vineyard-experiences-that-go-beyond-your-typical-tasting?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "keywords": ["experiences", "typical", "wine", "sea", "region", "terre", "vineyard", "light", "winery", "cinque", "grapes", "youre", "tasting"], "summary": "Here, we\u2019ve rounded up five vineyard and wine region trips that go well beyond the routine.\nNewton Vineyard, St. Helena, California, USANewton Vineyard, located in St. Helena, California, is a unique location for the Napa Valley region.\nThe St. Helena acreage is called Spring Mountain; the vineyard also owns other sites, but this is its most photogenic.\nRocca di Frassinello, Gavorrano, ItalyRocca di Frassinello is a coastal Tuscan vineyard comprising approximately 500 hectares of hillside splendor.\nLess recognized\u2014though no less impressive\u2014is Cinque Terre\u2019s local wine industry, which specializes in two white varieties: the eponymous Cinque Terre and the dessert wine Sciacchetr\u00e0.", "title": "5 Vineyard Experiences That Go Beyond Your Typical Tasting"}
