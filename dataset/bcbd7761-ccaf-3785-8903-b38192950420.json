With their promise of hope and new life, eggs feel particularly right this weekend, as many of us anticipate Monday\u2019s planned next step out of lockdown. Lots of us feel a bit like an uncooked egg at the moment: wobbly and fragile, encased in our shell. But now it\u2019s time to crack things open. We may have got a bit set in our ways over the past year or so, but don\u2019t forget we\u2019re as protean as eggs themselves: versatile, able to change and to do things differently. We all just need some heat to do so.", "Eggs baked in sticky kimchi rice (pictured above)", "I use the Thai Taste brand of sticky rice, which needs only a 30-minute soak and is widely available in supermarkets; if you use a different brand, check the packet for how long to soak it, because some can need as long as overnight.", "Soak 30 min", "Prep 15 min", "Cook 35 min", "Serves 4", "For the peppers", "4 small- to medium-sized red romano peppers, stalks on", "Salt", "4 large eggs", "2 tbsp double cream", "1\u00bd tsp gochujang paste", "2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced", "1\u00bd tbsp (5g) coriander leaves", "\u00bd tsp toasted sesame oil", "1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted and roughly crushed", "1 lime, cut into wedges, to serve", "For the sticky rice", "125g sticky rice, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes (or longer, depending on brand; see recipe intro)", "100g kimchi, finely chopped", "1 tsp toasted sesame oil", "2 tsp gochujang paste", "Salt", "Turn the oven grill to its highest setting. Cut a slit along down the length of each pepper, making sure they remain attached at the top and bottom, then scoop out and discard the seeds and pith. Lay the peppers slit side up on a wire rack set over a large tray, grill near the top of the oven for seven minutes, then carefully turn so they are now slit side down and grill for another seven minutes, until the skin is blackened and bubbling in places. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the rack, still slit side down, so any liquid drains away.", "Turn the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Drain the rice, then tip into a 24cm ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid. Add all the rest of the sticky rice ingredients, 180ml water and a third of a teaspoon of salt, and mix to combine. Bring up to aa simmer on a medium-high heat, then turn the heat down low, cover and leave to cook for six minutes.", "Once the rice is partially cooked, arrange the charred peppers open side up in a row across the centre of the rice. Push the peppers down into the rice, then open each one out and season the insides with a good pinch of salt.

The cream can be made the day before, but take it out of the fridge about half an hour before serving, so it softens. The meringue brittle makes more than you need, but it will keep in an airtight container for up to a week and is a perfect mid-afternoon treat.
