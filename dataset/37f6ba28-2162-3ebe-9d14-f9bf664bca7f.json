His peers agreed: they cited his book \u201cThe Material Ghost,\u201d from 1998, as the most influential work of cinema studies of that decade\u2014tied with Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s film \u201cHistoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma.\u201d He was also my teacher, and, later, my friend. I studied under him at Princeton in the late nineteen-seventies, where he was the one and only professor of cinema studies. After I graduated, in 1980, we met by chance at a MOMA screening a few years later, and remained in touch for the rest of his life. Perez was as devoted and generous a friend as he was an inspiring teacher and an original thinker.", "One of the last times that we saw each other, a year or so before his sudden passing, he told me that he was working on another book. He said it was about \u201cthe rhetoric of film\u201d and didn\u2019t say anything more about it. Now it\u2019s here: \u201cThe Eloquent Screen: A Rhetoric of Film\u201d was published, posthumously, by the University of Minnesota Press, in 2019. This month, I took part in a tribute to Perez at the Museum of the Moving Image (organized by another of his former students, Malia Haines-Stewart), where we screened John Ford\u2019s 1950 Western \u201cWagon Master,\u201d a film that I\u2019d first seen in his class on \u201cThe Political Cinema: Ford, Eisenstein, Mizoguchi,\u201d three filmmakers whose work he discusses extensively in the book. The screening was followed by a discussion in which the critic James Harvey, the programmer Edo Choi, and I celebrated the book, which I consider to be a landmark in the history of cinema studies, or what I\u2019d call the philosophy of cinema.", "In \u201cThe Eloquent Screen,\u201d Perez develops a grand theory of the cinema but doesn\u2019t trumpet this theory in bold rhetorical declarations. Rather, his theory steals in on cats\u2019 feet, in the course of his meticulous discussions of specific moments and themes from a wide range of films. The book is the act, or the performance, of a teacher: although written with graceful precision and sly wit, the book retains a tone of orality that, to me, is distinctly reminiscent of Perez\u2019s voice\u2014in particular, his classroom voice. It evokes his presence with a deeply moving immediacy; it also, like a screenplay, is a book that embodies the trace of performance. Teaching is, of course, a kind of performing, an expression that\u2019s simultaneously personal and formal. The modesty with which Perez develops his powerful ideas has that duality built into it; the book\u2019s arguments appear both sincere and ironic, and that combination of traits itself comes off not as a contradiction but as the very essence of the theory itself. His idea is, in effect, a theory of multiplicity, and it arrives through the book\u2019s carefully dialectical motion.", "\u201cThe Eloquent Screen\u201d is in three parts plus a coda, and its composition masks the book\u2019s vast scope and import. The substantial introductory section is devoted solely to Ford\u2014beginning with \u201cJudge Priest,\u201d continuing with \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln,\u201d ending with \u201cWagon Master\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s something of a surprise in its modesty. Perez\u2019s analysis of the films is largely focussed not on classical tropes of rhetoric featured in Ford\u2019s directorial method but on the deployment of rhetorical figures, within the context of the film, by Ford\u2019s characters. The analyses of the films are discerning\u2014one of the signal virtues of \u201cThe Eloquent Screen\u201d is the acuity of Perez\u2019s insights regarding the psychology of the action, the relationships of characters, the social and historical perspective embodied by a movie\u2014but their theoretical underpinning, at the outset, is gradual and is centered on the very role and status of rhetoric in the history of critical thought. Perez advances with the notion that rhetoric functions as something like the reality principle, the interface of speech and of art with real-world experience, and his consideration of Ford\u2019s cinematic rhetoric, which he interweaves with the political history of when the films were made, sustains his view of Ford as the most important American political filmmaker.", "The second section, \u201cCinematic Tropes,\u201d extensively considers the use of rhetorical analysis in literary theory. There, offering a history and a study of classical tropes (principally metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony), Perez considers their ubiquity in the composition of dozens of classic and modern movies, such as \u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d \u201cShoah,\u201d Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s \u201cCeddo,\u201d Renoir\u2019s \u201cToni,\u201d Eisenstein\u2019s \u201cBattleship Potemkin,\u201d Errol Morris\u2019s \u201cMr. Death,\u201d Godard\u2019s \u201cBand of Outsiders,\u201d and Kiarostami\u2019s \u201cClose-Up.\u201d Again, Perez presents his ideas through careful considerations of the films\u2019 crucial moments and themes, the filmmakers\u2019 careers and real-world identities and contexts, and the rhetorical figures that he discerns in their work. (Perez pays sympathetic attention to the work of other critics and theorists, which he assesses insightfully on the way to formulating his own illuminating views.) That chapter tellingly concludes on a brief but bold discussion of two of the grandest of all ideas, truth and beauty, which he calls both \u201cgoals\u201d and \u201cmeans of persuasion.\u201d", "On the heels of that divided unity, the third section, \u201cMelodrama and Film Technique,\u201d comes in, and it\u2019s the philosophical lightning and thunder unleashed by the first two parts\u2019 gradually brewing storm. The chapter\u2019s very theme is unity in division, an artistic dialectic in action, and it gives rise to his powerful overarching concept. First, Perez redeems the very notion of melodrama from its pejorative uses; then he adduces its mode of \u201cexaggeration\u201d to the historical underpinnings and enduring core of the cinema. In the process, he both relates the cinema to its roots in theatre and detaches the cinema from it. In thrillingly exacting discussions of a wide range of movies\u2014including Griffith\u2019s \u201cA Corner in Wheat,\u201d Murnau\u2019s \u201cNosferatu,\u201d Stroheim\u2019s \u201cGreed,\u201d Vidor\u2019s \u201cStella Dallas,\u201d Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cShadow of a Doubt,\u201d Mizoguchi\u2019s \u201cThe Life of Oharu,\u201d Malick\u2019s \u201cTo the Wonder,\u201d Wong Kar-wai\u2019s \u201cIn the Mood for Love,\u201d the Hughes brothers\u2019 \u201cMenace II Society,\u201d Mike Figgis\u2019s \u201cTimecode,\u201d and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cVolver\u201d (among many, many others)\u2014Perez shows that the exaggerations and artifices of melodrama are more than consistent with the evocation of emotional and social reality. In fact, they\u2019re central to it. So, for that matter, is the full range of filmmaking and movie viewing, in particular, performance, to which Perez pays exacting attention\u2014without losing sight of the centrality of direction to a viewer\u2019s experience of acting.", "Where the introduction and second section borrow concepts of rhetoric from the classical literary tradition (as revised by modern theorists), the third section, in effect, discovers new rhetorical tropes that arise strictly from within, and by way of, the cinema itself. The crucial idea is that of \u201cidentification,\u201d the subject of the book\u2019s brief coda, with reference to Buster Keaton\u2019s \u201cSherlock Jr.\u201d For Perez, there\u2019s no contradiction between a viewer\u2019s awareness of watching a movie and being emotionally engaged with the movie\u2019s characters, between noting brazen directorial interventions and getting carried away with the drama, between being inside and outside the movie at the same time. Not only is it no contradiction\u2014it\u2019s a constitutive dialectic of the cinema. That\u2019s why, if I had to sum up \u201cThe Eloquent Screen\u201d in three words, they would be the three-word motto that a teacher writes on a blackboard in \u201cBand of Outsiders\u201d: \u201cclassic = modern.\u201d", "In \u201cThe Eloquent Screen,\u201d Perez brings together films reflecting a wide range of industries, traditions, national cinemas, time periods, techniques, and experiences, in order to unite them, to find their coherences and similarities by means of probing analyses of their distinctively cinematic rhetoric. In the process, he virtually defines (indirectly and only by suggestion) a term that has long dominated the discussion of movies: \u201cmise en sc\u00e8ne,\u201d or staging, which refers to the relationship between text and image, drama and cinematic composition. The book sets up the notion of a new classical tradition, a specifically cinematic tradition, one that\u2019s based on the power of the twentieth century\u2019s new art form to borrow from existing forms to create its own new realm of experiences. The films that he gathers and studies exemplify this tradition, which Perez considers in its unity. But the book ends with an open door: it looks ahead to the question of what makes these and other films good\u2014of artists\u2019 own response to that tradition, their modifications or even repudiations of it, and the very concept of artistic merit in relation to, and apart from, the cinema\u2019s classical style. What its ending evokes is a third book in a trilogy, one that would have been a work of cinematic aesthetics. That the author isn\u2019t here to write it is as much of a historical tragedy as his absence is a personal one."], "authors": ["Richard Brody", "Luke Mogelson", "Jia Tolentino", "Alex Ross", "Erik Agard", "Jill Lepore"], "keywords": ["theory", "gilberto", "screen", "teacher", "films", "cinema", "rhetoric", "book", "perez", "tribute", "philosophy", "eloquent", "film", "cinematic"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
