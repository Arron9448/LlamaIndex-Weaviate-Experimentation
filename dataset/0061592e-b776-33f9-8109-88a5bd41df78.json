But, after a tumultuous 12 months in Spanish politics that saw two general elections and months of political manoeuvring before a government could be formed, the swearing-in last week of Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s leftwing coalition has seen the issue return.", "In the latest exchange between the two sides, the academy declared on Thursday it was \u201cgrammatically unacceptable\u201d for Yolanda D\u00edaz and Irene Montero of the junior coalition partner, Unidas Podemos, to refer to the government\u2019s cabinet (a council of minsters) as a consejo de ministras, instead of the approved consejo de ministros. It said the former would only be applicable if the cabinet were all-female, something that has never happened.", "Calvo disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s time the constitution had a language that respects both genders,\u201d she said. \u201cIt only has masculine language and this isn\u2019t appropriate in a modern democracy.\u201d", "In common with many gender-based languages, Spanish defaults to a generic masculine when it isn\u2019t specified whether the subject is male or female. For example, a girl is a ni\u00f1a and a boy a ni\u00f1o, but collectively children are ni\u00f1os.", "One solution hit upon by supporters of inclusive language is to \u201cdouble up\u201d on genders so that \u201cthe neighbourhood children\u201d becomes \u201cthe neighbourhood boys and girls\u201d, but such innovations can infuriate traditionalists. Montero, the equality minister, was ridiculed when she referred to a spokeswoman (portavoz) as a portavoza because voz is a feminine noun, whether it pertains to a man or a woman. Rewriting the constitution to be more inclusive would entail replacing about 500 words and considerable doubling up, starting with \u201cSpanish citizens\u201d \u2013 ciudadanos/ciudadanas espa\u00f1oles/espa\u00f1olas.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Feminism flowered in 1930s Spain with figures like Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri (La Pasionara). Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images", "The conservative-minded academy has so far managed to evade the question but has previously defended the gender neutrality of masculine nouns. \u201cDoubling up is artificial and unnecessary from a linguistic perspective,\u201d it said in an official statement. \u201cIn the case of nouns that describe living beings it is possible to use the generic masculine to designate the type of being, that is to say, all of the individuals of the species, regardless of sex. The explicit use of the feminine is only justified when the opposition of the sexes is relevant.\u201d", "Sources at the academy claim the government\u2019s demand is politically rather than linguistically motivated. \u201cWe think inclusive language is the language we habitually speak,\u201d said one member.", "The battle over language is only the latest fought by Spanish feminists, whose movement flowered in the 1930s during the second republic when women such as Clara Campoamor campaigned for women\u2019s suffrage and Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, better known as La Pasionaria, was a leader of the Communist party and the anti-fascist movement.", "When the fascist victory in 1939 installed a Catholic dictatorship, feminism was delayed but has since been making up for lost time. In fact, the first feminist congress was held just 17 days after General Franco\u2019s death in 1975.", "Today, the spokeswomen for the #MeToo movement in the European parliament, Amelia Mart\u00ednez Lobo and Arantxa Calvera, are both Spanish. Now, in what is considered its fourth wave, the movement has become more militant, especially in the wake of two recent and notorious gang-rape cases where the judges ruled that the victim\u2019s passivity implied consent.", "Over the past two years this growing militancy has seen millions of women take to the streets on International Women\u2019s Day, which takes place on 8 March this year. The movement\u2019s main focus is on sexual consent, equal pay, parental leave and violence against women.", "The language issue may seem odd to some British feminists. On the one hand, Spanish activists want to replace the generic masculine by doubling up. On the other, they insist on denoting gender in words like juez/jueza (judge) and alcalde/alcaldesa (mayor), precisely the sort of distinction \u2013 mayoress, conductress \u2013 that their British counterparts have opposed as unnecessary."], "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "keywords": ["nouns", "inclusive", "feminist", "academy", "battle", "spain", "masculine", "constitution", "movement", "split", "generic", "doubling", "spanish", "neutral", "language"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
