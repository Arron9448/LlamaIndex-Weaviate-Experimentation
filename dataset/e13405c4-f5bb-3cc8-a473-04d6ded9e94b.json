Not a bit of it. In 25 economies tracked by The Economist, house prices rose by 5%, on average, in the latest 12 months for which figures are available. In America they climbed by 11% in the year to January. In Britain they are up by 8%. In almost covid-free New Zealand, they have soared by 22%. Like other asset prices, house values have been buoyed by ultra-low interest rates and fiscal stimulus. Furlough schemes have limited distress sales. And the expectation (or hope) that people will keep working at home more and in offices less has fuelled demand for space away from the centres of big cities (a trend already long under way in the American West). Some central bankers worry about the pace of price rises. But there is no sign of slackening lending standards, as in past booms. Policymakers should tackle the market\u2019s long-term problems: that means getting rid of tax breaks for homeowners and regulations that shackle supply.", "America\u2019s economic recovery seems well under way\u2014as we report this week, using mobility data from Google and other \u201chigh-frequency\u201d sources. The IMF, which has raised its forecast for global GDP growth this year to 6%, thinks that by 2024 America\u2019s economy will be as big as it had expected before the pandemic. That\u2019s a faster return to form even than in China. Fiscal stimulus and vaccinations have made the fund cheerier about rich countries (but gloomier about the poorest, which lack financial firepower and jabs). President Joe Biden\u2019s $2trn splurge on infrastructure (including a climate-friendly dollop) should fuel the economy further. To finance it, he wants companies to pay more tax; and this week his treasury secretary floated a global minimum corporate-tax rate.", "Even before the pandemic, many of the world\u2019s workers were already under pressure, because of competition from freer trade, technological change and more. Covid-19 cost millions of jobs and exacerbated severe inequalities. Yet as economies recover, labour markets are bouncing back too\u2014America\u2019s unemployment rate is already down to 6% from 15% last spring. And a special report in this week\u2019s issue argues that labour markets before the pandemic were better than many critics argued (measured, for example, by employment rates or by wage increases at the bottom end). The pandemic\u2019s legacy to the world of work may benefit many, by speeding up trends already under way, such as remote working. This may even encourage bosses to communicate better with their underlings\u2014although some may never learn.", "On current trends South Asia will soon overtake the European Union as the centre of the covid-19 pandemic. India, where new cases jumped from 15,000 per day to 100,000 in a month, has passed America and Brazil in daily infections. Numbers are also rising fast in neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan, and outstripping vaccination efforts in all three countries. India is inoculating more than 3m people a day, but in a country of 1.4bn with the disease spreading rapidly, perhaps 10m are needed to flatten the curve. The biggest vaccine-maker has been told to halt exports. But there is far better news from another neighbour, tiny Bhutan, which received a gift of vaccines from India in January, waited for an astrologically auspicious moment in late March to start inoculations\u2014and then jabbed 85% of its adults within a week."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["house", "despite", "economies", "working", "pandemic", "boom", "trends", "india", "way", "worlds", "better", "markets", "prices", "week"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
