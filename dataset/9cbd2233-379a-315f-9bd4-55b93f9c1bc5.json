But the immediate shock of the Covid recession could be offset by employment in low-CO 2 sectors, finds the report, while significant strides would be made towards transitioning the economy away from fossil fuels over the next decade. The proposals are costed at \u00a368bn \u2013 about a third of the government\u2019s total Covid response spend of approximately \u00a3190bn to date.", "The report also points to significant benefits for constituencies the government has pledged to \u201clevel up\u201d \u2013 a number of which have been among the hardest hit by the economic fallout of the past 13 months.
