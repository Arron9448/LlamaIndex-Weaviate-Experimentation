The relations are there, I have seen relations changing in time, some people I am quite sure that people will be open and talk to each other. I don\u2019t think our industry is a particularly sincere, trustworthy or reliable one in general.\u201d", "Earlier, the Super League had vowed to \u201creshape the project\u201d after its plans were left in tatters. Chelsea led the way on Tuesday, signalling an abrupt U-turn only 48 hours after Sunday\u2019s bombshell announcement about the creation of the controversial league. Manchester City followed suit before Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham completed the Premier League contingent\u2019s embarrassing volte face. On Wednesday morning, both Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Internazionale signalled their exits too, before Milan joined them.", "\u201cDespite the announced departure of the English clubs, forced to take such decisions due to the pressure on them, we are convinced our proposal is fully aligned with European law and regulations,\u201d an ESL statement read. \u201cGiven the current circumstances, we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community.\u201d", "Milan jumping ship leaves a third Serie A club, Juventus, and the Spanish pair of Real Madrid and Barcelona as the last standing members of the breakaway group. Juventus released a statement that did not confirm their departure but instead admitted that the project could not be \u201ccompleted in the form in which it was initially conceived\u201d, in keeping with Agnelli\u2019s admission earlier on Wednesday.", "The six Premier League clubs bailed after a furious backlash to the plan from fans, players and managers over the past two days. The UK government expressed its willingness to use legislation to derail the project, while there was also a royal intervention from Prince William.", "01:16 Chelsea fan protests turn to celebrations as club pulls out of Super League \u2013 video", "Meanwhile, the Football Association threatened sanctions on clubs and bans for players at rebel teams, as did Uefa \u2013 the European governing body \u2013 and Fifa, its global counterpart.", "Yet undeterred by the fallout, the ESL, headed by Real Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, said it remained committed to getting the project up and running, even though any competition that did emerge would bear little resemblance to what was originally planned."], "authors": ["Mike Hytner"], "keywords": ["project", "breakaway", "think", "teams", "agnelli", "football", "league", "admits", "ahead", "juventus", "european", "super", "pull", "clubs"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
