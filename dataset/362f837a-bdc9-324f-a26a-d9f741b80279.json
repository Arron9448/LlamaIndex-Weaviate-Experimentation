He has spent the last couple of years scripting a comedy series with his brother Brian, and is now well-versed in character arcs, structure and the like. He has also learned something crucial about working with your sibling.", "\u201cIf you look over during a mixed martial arts scene to see your brother with a boner, it really has to be comedic,\u201d he says via Zoom to the soundtrack of Brian\u2019s uproarious laughter in a separate window. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re in a very dark place.\u201d", "Lols might not seem instantly synonymous with the Gleeson brothers. Domhnall is probably better known for being savaged by a werewolf as a Weasley brother in the Harry Potter films, sneering haughtily as General Hux in the last Star Wars trilogy, or getting scalped by Tom Hardy in The Revenant. One of Brian\u2019s recent roles, meanwhile, saw him crucify someone as Peaky Blinders\u2019 Jimmy McCavern. And, when the pair were on screen together, playing warring brothers in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s psychological shocker Mother!, it ended with Domhnall\u2019s character stoving in the head of Brian\u2019s character with a doorknob.", "But their latest project, Frank of Ireland, is a slapstick-packed gag fest. Exec-produced by Sharon Horgan, it follows Brian (pronounced \u201cBree-an\u201d) as the titular antihero: a failed musician who has recently been dumped by on-off girlfriend \u00c1ine (Sarah Greene) and lives with his mum Mary (Pom Boyd) in the \u2019burbs of Malahide, a small town in County Dublin. As Frank attempts to fish his life from the toilet, he is constantly shadowed by Domhnall (pronounced \u201cDough-nall\u201d) as his moronic best mate, Doofus. The pair constantly try to convince themselves that their humdrum lives are more interesting than they are by depicting themselves as a rollcall of movie icons ranging from Travis Bickle to Robin Hood as played by Kevin Costner.", "It is not exactly the next career move you\u2019d expect from two actors who are increasingly in-demand Hollywood names. Some of the goofier moments in the show include food fights, being urinated on by dogs and the aforementioned boner scene, where the pair are beaten up during a cage fight while Brian\u2019s Lycra pants are absurdly distended around the crotch area. Which is one hell of a way to avoid being typecast.", "\u201cI hope some people will be surprised to see us in a comedy like this,\u201d says Domhnall. \u201cPart of the reason I wanted to write Frank of Ireland is that not many people ask us to do this sort of thing. I\u2019ve always wanted to do slapstick stuff, and this lets us work in pratfalls and just play a total child.\u201d", "The brothers are talking from opposite sides of the Irish Sea. Older bro Domhnall, 37, is in Dublin, his all-black outfit matching the colour of the poster for Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Punch-Drunk Love that sits behind him. Brian, 33, peers through tortoiseshell glasses in a Hackney living room. Lockdown might have meant that Zoom is the only way the pair can meet for an interview but today that\u2019s not so bad. \u201cIt\u2019s Paddy\u2019s Day, so I\u2019d normally be inside, keeping away from the streets,\u201d chuckles Brian gruffly. He is the more reserved of the pair, full of deadpan, almost Eeyore-ish humour in contrast to Domhnall\u2019s high-energy enthusiasm.", "Pop hooks ... Liz Fitzgibbon with Brian and Domhnall Gleeson in Frank of Ireland. Photograph: Peter Marley", "Much of the show\u2019s joy comes from the way the two leads bounce off one another. Brian\u2019s turn as Frank is a stomp through bouts of pathetic, arrested-development angst. Domhnall is intensely likable as Doofus, a human doormat/absolute sweetie for whom getting a new hoodie is a major life event. Their relationship is summed up by a scene where Frank is sulking in his bathtub, with Doofus curled up behind him like a human bath-pillow. It is immediately obvious that this isn\u2019t the two brothers\u2019 first project together. It\u2019s also not even their first project where Brian plays someone called Frank.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it ended up like this,\u201d says Domhnall of the fact that this now completes a Frank-based trilogy for him. That being both the name of the role he wrote and directed for Brian in Noreen, a farcical short film about two feckless coppers botching a suicide investigation (featuring dad Brendan as the other policeman), and the title of the Lenny Abrahamson film he appeared in alongside Michael Fassbender.", "\u201cWasn\u2019t Frank the name you used in Starbucks for a while, Brian?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s true. I really couldn\u2019t deal with going: \u2018It\u2019s pronounced \u2018Bree-an\u2019, so write down \u2018Brian\u2019. But then make sure you say \u2018Bree-an\u2019 when you give it to me,\u2019\u201d laughs Brian. \u201cBut Frank is also my middle name.\u201d", "\u201cIs it? Well, you learn something new every day,\u201d chuckles Domhnall.", "For Frank of Ireland, Brian and Domhnall brought in Michael Moloney, a comedy writer who had been partnering on scripts with Domhnall since the pair had gotten hold of a camcorder while at school together and started making movies. \u201cBad movies,\u201d chuckles Moloney on a separate Zoom call.", "Hats off ... Brian Gleeson as Jimmy McCavern in Peaky Blinders. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn Mandabach", "Seeking inspiration for the series, the Gleesons and Moloney wandered Dublin for hours, thrashing out ideas. With the trio having grown up in the same town, their thoughts turned to the daft adventures they\u2019d filled the endless days of their childhood with, from the monster movies Domhnall and Moloney would film, through to \u201cjust wandering into McDonald\u2019s and thinking: \u2018This is absolutely amazing.\u2019\u201d There was also a strange obsession with a fake country singer.", "\u201cOnce a year myself and Michael would meet up and write a terrible country song together. Things like Tenner in Your Sock, about the importance of keeping a tenner in your sock,\u201d laughs Domhnall.", "\u201cWhen we were explaining to our girlfriends: \u2018We\u2019re going to be gone for a day and a half to write all night and record a terrible country song,\u2019 it just became easier to say: \u2018We\u2019re working on a character.\u2019 We called him Duke Governs, and he led on to parts of Frank.\u201d", "At one point, Frank of Ireland becomes even more of a family affair. The two lead actors are joined by their father Brendan, the Emmy-winning actor known for roles in Gangs of New York, In Bruges and Harry Potter. He plays an older version of Frank, and rocked up on set with a suitcase full of clothes based on his concept for the character.", "Force to be reckoned with ... Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Photograph: Everett/Alamy", "Domhnall, Brian and Brendan have previously worked together in the aforementioned Noreen, as well as donning bad wigs and deliberately hammy performances for Enda Walsh\u2019s play The Walworth Farce. And in 2019, their author and screenwriter brother Rory penned Psychic, a Sky Comedy short film about an ageing medium forced out of retirement by his scheming sons. It was directed by Brendan and featured a soundtrack by composer brother Fergus (who also sings a country number for Frank of Ireland). Is humour something they naturally gravitate towards as a family?", "\u201cI think so. Mam [Brendan\u2019s wife, Mary] is really funny. There\u2019s a lot of laughter whenever we\u2019re all together in the house,\u201d offers Domhnall.", "\u201cAlso, I\u2019m always a little wary of the fact that we\u2019re working together \u2013 so you don\u2019t want it to feel too self-conscious,\u201d says Brian. \u201cFor family projects, I want it to be something that\u2019s fun rather than too heavy.\u201d", "Given the risk of people assuming you have had a leg-up from your famous father rather than bagged a project on your own merit, that\u2019s not surprising. Indeed, Domhnall initially considered turning down the role he was offered in Harry Potter, lest people (mistakenly) thought he was only cast due to his father. But having a dad with so much industry experience does give them access to plenty of insider wisdom.", "\u201cWhen we both became actors, Dad said: \u2018Don\u2019t wait for the phone to ring. You\u2019ve got to create your own work,\u2019\u201d says Brian. \u201cSo why wouldn\u2019t you create something you want to be in that other people aren\u2019t giving you?\u201d", "Act to follow ... Brian and Domhnall with dad Brendan Gleeson (left). Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock", "Frank of Ireland certainly fits that mould. At times there is a genuine originality to the writing, particularly in terms of the truly gonzo film send-ups that are shot through each episode. The series opens with a languorous, cinematic take-off of Taxi Driver \u2013 all jazzy cello soundtrack and misty streets, filtered through the lives of two losers who can\u2019t drive, so have to recreate the monologues while being chauffeured around Dublin by bemused local cabbies. Meanwhile, the show\u2019s Memento-inspired season finale might be the smartest ending to a sitcom in years. Not least because it\u2019s preceded by daft slapstick recreations of Home Alone booby-traps and a hilariously weird plant-based spoof of A Few Good Men: \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the fruit!\u201d", "It is also a show that manages to be absolutely prolific in its usage of swear words. The effing and jeffing doesn\u2019t just come from the two leads, either. The air is turned blue by doctors, mothers, recently bereaved granddaughters and extremely young-looking country musicians. It is hard to think of another recent mainstream sitcom that features the same volume of expletives.", "\u201cYou know, it didn\u2019t strike me as being that sweary until people pointed it out,\u201d smiles Moloney of a show that includes the lead character\u2019s mother being told to \u201cshove it up your dick\u201d in the very opening scene of episode one. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a feature I particularly noticed. Maybe it\u2019s an Irish thing.\u201d", "Maybe. Or perhaps it\u2019s the result of writers who think that a fun sibling activity is cage fighting with fake erections? Either way, there is no denying that it makes for a gloriously silly series.", "Frank of Ireland airs Thursday 15 April, 10pm, Channel 4"], "authors": ["Alexi Duggins"], "keywords": ["ireland", "country", "brian", "film", "domhnall", "frank", "surprised", "pair", "brother", "comedy", "gleeson", "moloney"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
