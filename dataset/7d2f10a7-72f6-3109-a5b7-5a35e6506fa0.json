She thinks this switch will be reflected in new residential buildings.", "Additionally, prolonged periods spent on the same sofa or chair mean \u201cbeauty will need to meet ergonomics\u201d in luxury furniture. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to bring our office chair to our house . . . but we need to have the same ergonomics in order not to end up with a problem with our backs,\u201d she says. She thinks furniture will have a double or triple function: a dining table could have power and data connectivity too.", "This four-bedroom modernist home, designed by Brazilian architect Marcio Kogan in the S\u00e3o Paulo district of Alto de Pinheiros, has a separate ground-floor office for homeworking with sliding glass doors opening on to the garden. The property is on the market for R$25m ($4.8m).", "Green design", "Sustainability will be upgraded from \u201c\u2018nice to have\u2019 to essential in house design\u201d, says Gerald Parsonson, founder of New Zealand-based practice Parsonson Architects. This will require practical considerations about the use of low carbon materials, their life cycle and carbon outputs, meaning architects might predominantly favour \u201cmaterials like timber that lock up carbon, rather than generating it\u201d.", "As the lives of the city-based majority are distanced from the natural world, Parsonson hopes that architects respond by creating spaces that \u201ccelebrate a growing connection with nature\u201d. He suggests, \u201cLetting in and filtering sun and light with spaces that are calm, zen, layered, green and natural, involving great connections to outdoor spaces no matter how small.\u201d Unique features for sustainable water collection or electricity generation become \u201carchitectural elements\u201d.", "This five-bedroom \u201ceco-home\u201d on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, which overlooks both bush and the Pacific Ocean, makes use of timber including teak and local kauri.

This, she predicts, will result in the use of materials such as velvet, curly wool, wood and wicker.", "\u201cIt may be with the year that we\u2019ve had, with the pandemic and everything, people are at home and they want to feel secure and comfy,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot go outside, you cannot go to nature as much as you want to, so you need to create it at home a little bit.\u201d", "The current owners of this two-bedroom apartment on the prestigious Avenue Victor-Hugo in Paris\u2019 16th arrondissement have embraced velvet furnishings in the living area. Permanent decor features of the third-floor property, available for \u20ac1.73m, include parquet flooring.", "Making a statement", "Meridith Baer, founder of US-based home staging company Meridith Baer Home, agrees that potential buyers will be looking for utility and comfort as well as beauty in a property. They will also want to see something different, she predicts, as a trend for modern decor over the past decade or so has led to a \u201csameness in homes\u201d.", "She and her colleagues have been looking at ways to incorporate more history and interesting items into the modern look (main picture, above). This might mean introducing antiques, inherited items or pieces of art, or showcasing an owner\u2019s personal collection \u2014 for example, glassware.", "In Los Angeles, Baer says the modern look became grey, beige, white and black. She suggests buyers are now \u201ccraving a little more colour\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we start seeing floral and other designs from the past just to liven things up a bit,\u201d she says.", "There is plenty of colour in this three-bedroom apartment in New York, one of 17 abodes in a Rosario Candela-designed 1920s block overlooking Central Park.

The property is listed at $14.5m.", "Useful gardens", "Recent years have seen the \u201cslow creep\u201d of homeowners wanting to make outside space \u201cusable and functional as well as beautiful\u201d, according to UK-based landscape architect Jo Thompson, but this has come more into focus as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. She says people particularly want garden rooms and covered areas for outdoor cooking.", "There is also an emphasis on mindful activities. \u201cWe have been putting in meditative spaces, whether it\u2019s a yoga studio or a covered space for yoga,\u201d says Thompson. Other requests include creating pathways through wooded areas within a garden so residents can take \u201ca mindful walk\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about forest bathing and green being good for you and I think clients are starting to understand that,\u201d she says.", "The covered poolside outdoor kitchen of this six-bedroom villa in the upmarket Mallorcan resort of Port d\u2019Andratx includes a barbecue, gas grill, meat cooker, two fridges and a freezer, with bar seating enabling the cook to socialise with family members or guests while preparing dinner.
