Their tight white wrapping carried not only English words but a stylish French inscription, Pas recommand\u00e9 pour utiliser dans les boissons chaudes. Released from that confinement, springing up ready, they stood straight, stiff and tall as a stalk of wheat, with no disfiguring articulations; for they never quailed or bent. And their colour was beautiful. It was darker than the leaves of spring, lighter than the Washington forests and the logo of the company, yet fresh, viridian, straight from the palette of a Monet or a Van Gogh. But despite all that they were doomed to disappear by 2020, for not being green enough.", "Of course, the straws had long since left their rustic ancestors behind. You could not thatch a cottage roof with them, or weave a hat. At best, they might compose a mat; they would have made poor bedding in barns. Shepherds could not pipe a ditty on them, and poets could not use them as metaphors for the unsubstantiality of life. They had never been blowing crop-stems rippling in the summer wind, entwined with convolvulus and heartsease. Their nearest relatives were not delicate grasses, but single-use plastic stirrers.", "Yet this did not concern them, because they had a higher calling: to refresh human beings. Rather than pumping up the customer with hot high-octane espressos or Americanos, winding him up for the drudgery of the working day, they cooled him with less caffeine and more play. Teenagers needed them to socialise, tired shoppers to wind down, children to amuse themselves. All these folk could have quaffed their Frappuccino\u00ae Blended Beverage or their iced teas directly from the plastic cup, of course. Some did, ignoring the eager straws standing ready. But it was never as elegant, as dramatic or so much fun.", "Fun was why green straws had been conceived at all. They began their service not when Starbucks was founded, in 1971, but when it introduced the Caramel Frappuccino\u00ae almost three decades later. Green straws marched in, along with whipped cream and caramel drizzle, as emblems of summer and self-indulgence. They meant happiness. Yet for each of those straws, the Frappuccino\u00ae and its successors posed a serious test of character. For with them too came a domed plastic lid, the Hill of Destiny, surmounting a steep pile of cream through which straws had to plunge to do their duty. Through the flat lids of iced coffees, now sharply scored with a cross, they were expected to do the same.", "Human lips were gentle, thoughtful, persuasive; these straws were too stout to be hurt by teeth. But some lids were brutal. And once entry was effected, the route was perilous: either down through smothering cream, or into a bruising welter of ice cubes into which they were jammed repeatedly, cruelly, to make the drink longer and colder. Each straw did its best. Older customers were more considerate, having grown up with inferior and quickly soggy paper straws; they took care. Young folk left daubs of lipstick on them, blew bubbles with them, flicked cream, banged them on the bottom of the cup to get one last taste\u2014and repeatedly made them march up the Hill of Destiny, and plunge again, for the hell of it. But no straw ever complained.", "When manoeuvres were completed most Starbucks straws withdrew to the bin, either in-store or in the street. They were resigned to this, though it was shaming for creatures so smart and orderly to lie higgledy-piggledy with cups and crumpled wrappers: a poor reward for their service. Others, thrown down on the floor or pavement, nobly accepted the trampling of the crowd. A fortunate few were enshrined in children\u2019s projects, or found a second career as stems for gaudy artificial flowers.", "The last straw", "Some retreated further. They lay where they were thrown in woods, or fields, or among the hills. There they sometimes kept awkward company with their ancestor-straws, having nothing much to say to them, for theirs had been a world of steel, glass, neon and bright lights, laughter and noise, and here there was only wind and sky. They could at least impress these uncomprehending stalks with one thing: they were not bound for the bale or the barn floor, and would never be dust. They had eternal life. And that was the trouble.", "This article appeared in the Obituary section of the print edition under the headline \"The thin green line\""], "authors": [], "keywords": ["summer", "wind", "plastic", "straws", "starbucks", "straight", "frappuccino", "farewell", "straw", "green", "thrown", "cream"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
