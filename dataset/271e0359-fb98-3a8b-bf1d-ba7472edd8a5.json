I\u2019ve heard some friends and colleagues go so far as to compare the process to the search for swimwear\u2013the horror. But, similar to finding a bathing suit that fits in all the right places, discovering a new pair of perfectly cut and comfortable jeans can be thrilling. Personally, I get so excited when I find denim that I can dub \u201cthe one\u201d that I not only end up stockpiling backup pairs, but I also make sure to text all of my friends and family so they too can share in my discovery. This time around, after landing my latest denim treasure, I\u2019m going a step further and shouting their name from the Internet rooftops right here, right now. Yes, they are that good.", "Like many around the world who are and have been working from home for the first time, I\u2019ve spent a lot of my days in Zoom-appropriate tops paired with a variety of pajama pants, sweatpants, and leggings below the screen. While I\u2019ve enjoyed embracing uncharted sartorial comfort during such an uncomfortable time, I\u2019ve missed structure, both in terms of my day and my choice of pants. As weeks turned to months over the last year, I decided that one of the simple tweaks I could make to my days was changing what I wear to separate the personal time from the professional. Now, I get up early, I work out in my leggings, shower, and put on my work clothes head-to-toe, with no exceptions.", "It was this self-enforced schedule that led me to the jeans that would change my at-home life. As a huge fan of classic, medium blue, no-stretch denim, I found it a little hard to sit at my dining room table for hours on end even in my most-loved pairs. But just when I thought I\u2019d have to give up on getting back into my jeans, I stumbled on a pair of new high-rise, straight leg, ankle grazing, true-blue Gap jeans that seemed too good to be true. They even promised stretch without looking like they knew stretch denim had ever been invented. And it\u2019s true, these beauties look and feel and fit very much as advertised. Needless to say I\u2019m obsessed. I\u2019ve not only bought both colors but I\u2019ve invested in backup pairs too, which is the true test of a perfect piece of clothing. The Gap jeans are as classic as they come and they give me that figure-hugging fit without cutting off my circulation. I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s taken either. At the moment, there are TikTok videos circulating about these jeans, making me one member of an ever-growing fan club.", "While good jeans are priceless, these bonafide confidence boosters are also now on sale for $63.
