Production remains illegal but the coffee shops are allowed to sell it.", "Halsema said the measure would take some months to become effective because there would need to be a period of consultation and transition for coffee shop owners, and the city wanted to introduce a hallmark scheme for approved vendors.", "Similar bans, backed by a 2012 law, already exist in cities such as Maastricht and Den Bosch, which have long complained of excessive numbers of pot-smoking visitors crossing the borders from Belgium, Germany and France.", "Fearing an out-of-control street market, Amsterdam did not impose the so-called \u201cresidence criterion\u201d on its hash cafes, which account for about a third of the Dutch total, instead banning smoking in parts of the city and closing individual shops.", "Fuelled by cheap flights and online booking, however, tourist numbers in Amsterdam \u2013 a city of 850,000 residents \u2013 have surged to nearly 20 million visitors a year, many of them young and on tight budgets. More than 29 million are forecast by 2025.", "The city has taken several steps to reduce overcrowding and nuisance caused by over-tourism in the city centre, curbing the number of shops targeting visitors, clamping down on Airbnb, halting new hotel developments and increasing taxes.", "Local businesses have largely welcomed the announcement.
