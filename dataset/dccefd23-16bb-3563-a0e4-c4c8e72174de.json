For many, Baldwin\u2019s writing has long been a touchstone of anti-racist humanism, but the sense of that particular epithet has never landed more emphatically for me than while reading Eddie S Glaude Jr\u2019s Begin Again, his potent meditation on the enduring legacy of Baldwin\u2019s life and thought, a New York Times bestseller and one of a number of titles that have spoken to the soul of public outrage at George Floyd\u2019s killing in Minneapolis last May.", "Glaude, who is distinguished professor and chair of the African American studies department at Princeton University (where he has been teaching a seminar on Baldwin for several years), is also a native of Jackson County, Mississippi, the US state that suffered the highest number of lynchings \u2013 581 between 1882 and 1968. The trauma of that inheritance \u2013 \u201cour bodies carry the traumas forward,\u201d Glaude writes \u2013 is never far from the page. Nor is the trauma felt across black America in his parents\u2019 generation when in 1968 Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, crushing hopes for \u201cfundamental change\u201d that had been gathering around the US civil rights movement for the best part of a decade.", "It was out of despair, Glaude writes, that in 2018, two years after what he calls \u201cthe disastrous election of Donald Trump\u201d, he started to write this book, \u201csaying to myself, they have done it again. Millions of white Americans had chosen Trump, and we would have to deal with the consequences of that choice.\u201d", "Reckoning with that \u201cbetrayal\u201d, like so many previous betrayals of democratic possibility in America, perpetrated by those hell-bent on preserving the fantasy that America is or ever was a white nation, he recalls his dad\u2019s claim, growing up, that he just didn\u2019t \u201cdo white people\u201d. Now Glaude, too, \u201cunderstood a bit better\u201d that separatist impulse, though, in these new times of Trumpian ascendancy, it was Baldwin, not his disillusioned father, to whom he turned in order to deal with his despair. \u201cBaldwin,\u201d Glaude suggests, \u201coffers us resources.\u201d", "I Am Not Your Negro review \u2013 thrilling James Baldwin documentary Read more", "As a figure of Glaude\u2019s parents\u2019 generation, Baldwin was both a giant and an anomaly \u2013 the kid from Harlem whose depiction of black American life through the great migration (in 1953\u2019s Go Tell It on the Mountain) had made him a literary sensation while still in his 20s. By the age of 30, he was a household name, at which point he dared, at the height of his celebrity, to write, in 1956\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room and 1962\u2019s Another Country, from the viewpoint of protagonists who were both white and gay, endearing himself to liberals and to fashionable society but suffering, as a result, \u201cthe label of bootlicker [back home] for making this point that categories can shut us off from the complexity within ourselves\u201d.", "The son of a preacher, Baldwin wrote repeatedly of love, and of his belief in America\u2019s future as a multiracial society, and his hope of redemption for white Americans and black Americans alike \u2013 a vision that perhaps saw its most focused articulation in the blistering essays of 1963, The Fire Next Time, which were seen as giving voice to the emerging civil rights movement.", "As the 1960s unfolded, though, and the optimism of the civil rights era was met with renewed violence and resistance, Baldwin\u2019s own voice hardened and his tolerance of liberals became short \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody working with me because they are doing something for me,\u201d he said \u2013 and a question arose for him, writing in defence of a new generation of young black radicals, the first exponents of black power, whether white America was really worthy of so much energy and concern (as Martin Luther King continued to insist that it was).", "What we are living through, even with our cellphone cameras, is not unlike what Baldwin and so many others dealt with", "Then King was killed and, like so many of his time, Baldwin found himself derailed. \u201cHe went to pieces,\u201d Glaude tells us. \u201cHe witnessed what was happening in ghettos, where the workings [of white supremacy] impoverished millions. He saw the beginnings of mass incarceration and its effect on black communities. He also felt the emotional trauma of dashed hopes and expectations.\u201d He remained a witness to it all and \u201c12 years later\u201d, Glaude continues, \u201che watched the country elect Reagan, a clear indication, if there ever was one, that white America had no intention of changing when it came to matters of race\u201d.", "\u201cWhat we are living through,\u201d Glaude writes of the current context, \u201ceven with our cellphone cameras, is not unlike what Baldwin and so many others dealt with as the black freedom movement collapsed with the ascent of the Reagan revolution.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s response demonstrates the resilience that\u2019s needed to be a witness through an era of despair.", "There is a common reading of his career, dismissed by Glaude as a \u201cstale characterisation\u201d, that he hit the heights of his literary genius in 1963; that, thereafter, \u201chis rage and politics got the best of him\u201d but that he subsequently lost his nuance, lost touch with the love that had distinguished his voice in his prime, abandoned his gift for complexity; that in the aftermath of King\u2019s assassination and with the collapse of the civil rights movement, he\u2019d left himself nowhere to go; that by 1972 he was a writer in decline; that by the time of his death from stomach cancer in 1987, he was, to use a phrase from Darryl Pinckney, \u201ca spent force\u201d.", "Glaude challenges this convention with conviction. He invites us with him to \u201cread Baldwin to the end\u201d and reveals a writer, not spent, but rather illuminating the path beyond despair \u2013 the work of a saint if ever there was such a thing. This witness through the dark times, which Glaude argues are upon us once again, is, he says, the true measure of Baldwin\u2019s greatness: an enduring testament to his love and the belief that the US can and must be something more than it is.", "\u2022 Begin Again: James Baldwin\u2019s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Today by Eddie S Glaude Jr is published by Chatto & Windus (\u00a316.99).
