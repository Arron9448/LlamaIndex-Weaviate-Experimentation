Here is what it tells us.", "Change in deaths since 31 January (%) Daily average deaths Vaccine doses per 100 people to date Vaccines are yet to turn the tide More than 900m vaccine doses have been administered around the world so far, but it is still too early to see a global trend between countries\u2019 vaccination rates and recent changes in their death rates. Scientists say country-level data show vaccines are already reducing deaths in countries such as Israel and the UK. They are among the handful to reach the target zone of high vaccination rates and falling deaths since the beginning of 2021. Most countries with high vaccination rates are seeing deaths fall Most countries that have managed to give at least 50 vaccine doses for every 100 of their people are now seeing a steady decline in death rates. This includes the UK, where all top-priority people have now been offered a vaccine and deaths are down over 95% since January. But vaccinations alone are not enough Even with relatively high vaccination rates, the virus can still surge if social distancing is relaxed too soon. Chile is the clearest example, where deaths attributed to the Brazilian P1 variant are growing despite an aggressive vaccination campaign. Developing countries are falling behind Most poor or lower-middle income countries are nowhere near the target zone, with all but three of these 76 countries having rates below 10 doses per 100 people. Many are experiencing a resurgence in deaths since the end of January driven by deadly new Covid-19 variants. But even wealthier countries are struggling to vaccinate their populations Vaccine shortages as well as pauses due to safety concerns are slowing rollouts even in countries that have reserved enough doses to vaccinate their people several times over. Wealthy states are among the many still a long way from the target zone. Opening up, and staying open, is a realistic hope for only a few More than 20 countries have significantly relaxed the lockdowns they had in place during the surge in cases earlier in the year. Three of these \u2013 Israel, the Seychelles and the UK \u2013 have a vaccine rate of over 50 per 100 people, but the majority of those opening up still have little vaccine protection. Lockdowns have worked to reduce deaths in many of these countries, but only those in the highly-vaccinated target zone can realistically hope to break the cycle of relaxing and reinstituting social-distancing measures.
