Pfizer says it is only 52% after the first dose but the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says this may rise to 90% after 21 days.

May have up to 90% efficacy when given as a half dose followed by a full dose. No severe disease or hospitalisations in anyone who received the vaccine. There have been concerns it is less effective against the South African variant of the coronavirus, and some countries have suggested that it is less-effective against either older patients or younger patients. A UK government-funded study of care home residents in England found that their risk of infection with Covid-19 \u2013 either symptomatic or asymptomatic \u2013 fell by 62% five weeks after they received their first Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose.

Nearly 32 million people have had at least one jab. And yet the concept of herd immunity, achieved through vaccination in many other diseases, now raises eyebrows when it comes to Covid. With foreign travel opening up, socialising through the summer on the cards and variants emerging in all parts of the world, few scientists will bet on herd immunity any time soon.", "Herd immunity got a bad name at the beginning of the pandemic when Dr David Halpern, who headed No 10\u2019s \u201cnudge unit\u201d, talked on the BBC of protecting vulnerable people from this new disease and \u201cby the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population\u201d.", "Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific officer, estimated that 60% of the population would need to become immune, though it could be as many as 70%, and early on there was no alternative to catching the virus to achieve that.", "A year, three lockdowns and 127,000 deaths later, it is clear that even with very effective vaccines, herd immunity \u2013 in the sense of the end of any spread of the virus \u2013 would be very much harder to achieve than was supposed then.", "Manaus, on the Amazon river in Brazil, was thought last summer to have achieved herd immunity. Tests on donated blood suggested 66% of people had antibodies against the virus in July, following a devastating first wave of infection. By October that had risen to 76%. And then in January a second wave hit, hospitals were overwhelmed and patients\u2019 relatives pleaded for oxygen cylinders because the city had run out. Between 25% and 61% of those infected had already had one bout of Covid. They were not immune.", "08:31 'People are dying at hospital doors': the Brazilian volunteer delivering oxygen to Manaus \u2013 video", "The P1 variant was responsible for the savage second wave. It is now known to have a mutation called E484K that confers some resistance to vaccines and antibodies against the regular virus. The tale of Manaus was a salutary one \u2013 that Covid could never be allowed to run its course in hopes of generating herd immunity.", "\u201cWe need to define herd immunity carefully as we think about the future,\u201d said Prof Christl Donnelly, of Oxford University and Imperial College London (ICL), who is one of the authors of the React study of infections in the UK, which suggests immunity in the population is much lower than the UCL estimate.", "\u201cThe vaccines that are currently available are highly effective. However, we can\u2019t know now what variants may arise, though we know that limiting transmissions (with social distancing and/or vaccination) reduces the likelihood of important new variants arising,\u201d she said.", "\u201cPotential variants that are different enough that the existing vaccines don\u2019t protect against them are the key worry, as this could mean that new vaccines need to be developed and then rolled out.\u201d", "Friston and colleagues say the threshold for herd immunity varies according to the amount of infections occurring.

That, of course, was before the Kent virus took off.", "Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist in charge of Imperial College\u2019s Covid-19 modelling, who agrees with Kucharski, said herd immunity \u201cremains a useful concept, but is not an all or nothing thing\u201d.", "He said: \u201cThe immunity built up during the epidemic was slowing spread compared with what it would otherwise have been even before vaccination started. Just not sufficiently to avoid the second wave \u2013 especially with the more transmissible Kent variant.", "\u201cWhether it is possible to reach a level of herd immunity which stops further transmission even when we relax all controls is an open question in my mind. With the Kent variant now dominant, we require immunity to block at least 75% of transmission. Even with 90%-plus uptake of vaccines, that may not be possible without vaccinating under-16s. And even then it would require vaccines to be 90% effective at blocking transmission.\u201d", "Vaccination was not just about herd immunity, he said.
