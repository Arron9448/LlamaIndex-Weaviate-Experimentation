While the machine does its job, Hoffmann checks her email and eats her meals.", "\u201cShe pumps in the mornings on her break like around 8, and then she pumps at noon during lunch,\u201d said photographer Callaghan O\u2019Hare, who spent time with Hoffmann in early February. \u201cAnd then she pumps in the afternoon before she leaves around 2. It usually takes about 15 minutes or so, and then she refrigerates the milk and brings it home.\u201d", "Hoffmann gets ready for work on her second day back.", "Cloth diapers are hanged up to dry in the Hoffmans\u2019 house in San Antonio.

She dipped into savings and applied for short-term disability to make up some income for the rest of the eight weeks.", "\"I truly do wish that the US, or even the state, took it upon themselves to understand the value of parenthood,\" Hoffmann told the Reuters news agency. \"Providing time for fathers as spouses, partners as well, and to know that that time would be paid and supported is a huge burden off of a new family.\"", "Hoffmann takes some time to herself after putting her sons to bed.", "Hoffmann stands on a stool to reach a cabinet in her kitchen.", "There seems to be momentum building in Washington for an updated paid leave policy that would bring it in line with the rest of the industrialized world.
