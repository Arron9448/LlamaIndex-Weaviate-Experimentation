But Donald Trump\u2019s open willingness to ask foreign governments to dig up dirt on political opponents has been an idiosyncratic aspect of his rise to power. At a press conference in July, 2016, when he was the presumptive Republican nominee for President, he invited Russia to get hold of Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails and leak them to the press. This past June, George Stephanopoulos asked him what he thought his campaign should do now \u201cif foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else,\u201d offered information on his political opponents\u2014accept it or call the F.B.I.?", "Trump allowed that he might do both, adding, \u201cIf somebody called from a country\u2014Norway\u2014\u2018We have information on your opponent.\u2019 Oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d (When the interview was released, Ellen L. Weintraub, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, felt obliged to point out that \u201cit is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\u201d) We now know that, as Trump spoke to Stephanopoulos, he and Rudolph Giuliani, his personal lawyer, were deep in a vigorous effort to persuade the government of Ukraine to conduct investigations that might rake up some muck about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.", "Two bombshell documents made public this week\u2014a record of a telephone conversation between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s President, and a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about that call\u2014fully justify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision, announced on Tuesday, to open an official impeachment inquiry. The documents describe a breach of Trump\u2019s constitutional duties that is exceptional even in light of his record to date. During the telephone call, made on July 25th, he leveraged the vast disparity of wealth and power in the alliance between the United States and Ukraine to ask Zelensky to, in effect, aid his re\u00eblection bid. The complaint, filed on August 12th, by a person whom the Times has described as an intelligence officer, further recounts how U.S. national-security and foreign-policy officials who worked on issues concerning Ukraine became entangled in Trump\u2019s scheme, and how this distorted and undermined their work on behalf of American interests. According to the complaint, once it became clear how damaging the record of the call might be, Administration officials participated in a coverup, moving the memorandum of conversation\u2014the contemporaneous documentation of the call\u2014to a highly restricted computer system not intended for such materials.", "The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint is one of the great artifacts to enter Washington\u2019s sizable archive of political malfeasance. In the second paragraph, its author distills Trump\u2019s offense with bracing clarity: \u201cI have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The author goes on to provide a revelatory narrative about the underlying facts of the case, one that complements investigative reporting previously published by the Washington Post, the Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and other outlets.", "The complaint\u2019s lucidity and detail may help House investigators defend the integrity of their inquiry against the torrent of spin and lies that will surely continue to issue from Trump and his allies. When Washington scandals involving foreign affairs become politically contested, a timeworn tactic by those accused of wrongdoing is to befuddle the public; the unfamiliar names, tangled chronologies, and ambiguous meetings offer a way to distract non-obsessives from the heart of the matter. Already, Trump and Giuliani, on Twitter and Fox News, have fogged the record by repeating falsehoods and conspiracy theories. The story we can discern so far, however, retains a certain straightforwardness, thanks to Trump\u2019s lack of subtlety.", "Ukraine is enmeshed in a low-grade but persistent war with Russia, which began in February, 2014, after a popular revolution in Kiev that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, a corrupt ally of Moscow. He fled to Russia, and Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine. They seized Crimea, which Russia then annexed. Putin\u2019s motive was the reassertion of Russian power; the United States and Europe, stunned by his audacity, imposed sanctions and tried to shore up the post-revolutionary government in Kiev. In search of accountability, the new Ukrainian regime opened corruption investigations into the previous political order.", "That April, Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, a lawyer, accepted a lucrative seat on the board of one of Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas companies, Burisma Holdings, which is controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky. Burisma became a subject of Kiev\u2019s investigations, although the extent, seriousness, and focus of the inquiry are unclear. Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to accept the board seat when his father was the Vice-President and Ukraine\u2019s crises were of international importance showed questionable judgment. Since 2014, the Kiev government has been a ward of America and Europe; the potential for real or perceived conflicts of interest should have been apparent to both Bidens. Still, according to Ukrainian officials, no evidence of wrongdoing by either Hunter Biden or Zlochevsky has been found.", "In 2015, the United States and some of its European allies sought to oust Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, because they believed that he had gone soft on corruption. That September, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, denounced Shokin\u2019s failure \u201cto successfully fight internal corruption.\u201d In December, Joe Biden went to Kiev and told Ukraine\u2019s leaders that the U.S. would withhold loan guarantees if they didn\u2019t get rid of Shokin; he was ousted the following March. One of Giuliani\u2019s aims has been to encourage Ukraine to examine whether Shokin was pushed out to protect Burisma\u2014and, by extension, Hunter Biden\u2014from a corruption probe. But the record indicates that Shokin was removed because he wasn\u2019t doing enough about Ukrainian corruption. Vitaliy Kasko, a Ukrainian former prosecutor, recently told Bloomberg, \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky.\u201d He added that the Burisma case \u201cwas shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "67d47711-e4e9-3072-a4a6-042dc59ae5f0", "keywords": ["trumps", "russia", "ukraine", "record", "impeachment", "corruption", "trump", "ukraines", "united", "states", "ukrainian", "inquiry", "integrity"], "title": "The Integrity of the Trump Impeachment Inquiry", "summary": "Two bombshell documents made public this week\u2014a record of a telephone conversation between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s President, and a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about that call\u2014fully justify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision, announced on Tuesday, to open an official impeachment inquiry.\nThe complaint\u2019s lucidity and detail may help House investigators defend the integrity of their inquiry against the torrent of spin and lies that will surely continue to issue from Trump and his allies.\nAlready, Trump and Giuliani, on Twitter and Fox News, have fogged the record by repeating falsehoods and conspiracy theories.\nPutin\u2019s motive was the reassertion of Russian power; the United States and Europe, stunned by his audacity, imposed sanctions and tried to shore up the post-revolutionary government in Kiev.\nBut the record indicates that Shokin was removed because he wasn\u2019t doing enough about Ukrainian corruption.", "authors": ["Steve Coll", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "John Cassidy", "David Remnick"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
