It was only a couple of blocks away, but as he jogged over, he turned onto a side street and suddenly found himself facing a new line of protesters that had splintered off from the main group.

China\u2019s legal system is beholden to the ruling Communist Party -- it has a notoriously high conviction rate and a history of political prosecutions.
