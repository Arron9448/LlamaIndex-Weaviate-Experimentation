After a successful showing last summer at the New Museum, the Texas-born, Los Angeles\u2013based artist\u2019s first solo New York museum exhibition, Darling Divined, comes to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin this month\u2014opened at reduced capacity and with timed slots for patrons. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to take my family to see my work,\u201d he continues. \u201cI mean, I think there\u2019s some family who still don\u2019t quite know what I do.\u201d", "In all fairness, Brackens\u2019s work is quite complex; his graphic, handwoven textiles\u2014the biggest, around eight by eight feet\u2014consider folklore, mythology, Christianity, and history through the lens of his own Blackness and queerness. \u201cDiedrick\u2019s work is singular in its form, mindful in its every thread, and generative in its message,\u201d says Margot Norton, a curator at the New Museum. The cotton yarn that Brackens dyes by hand, sometimes using tea or bleach, is a nod to the crop\u2019s weighted history in the South; his own grandmother picked cotton as a girl. And when he works with human figures, his slim, dark silhouettes are mostly modeled on himself. The approach, Brackens explains, presents \u201ca vehicle to talk about people who live lives like mine.\u201d Adds Veronica Roberts, the Blanton\u2019s curator of modern and contemporary art, the works \u201cherald the complexity of Black bodies and experiences.\u201d", "Diedrick Brackens, the flame goes, 2017.

Early in his practice, West African kente cloth and medieval European Unicorn tapestries were important points of reference. Later, his discovery of figures like Hannah Ryggen\u2014a Scandinavian textile artist most popular between the 1930s and 1960s\u2014clued him in to the medium\u2019s potential to speak to now. When he started, 12 years ago, \u201cit was unusual to be weaving\u201d\u2014there was and still is a quaintness to the medium\u2014\u201cbut I think the computer just was not in our lives the way that it is now,\u201d he says. To live in the coronavirus era, when many of us are forced to be even more plugged-in than usual, \u201cheightens the experience of doing things by hand.\u201d", "Increasingly, his inspiration comes from life\u2014\u201clike, going out into the world and seeing things and then getting curious,\u201d he says\u2014and it leads him right back to Texas. (The region\u2019s catfish in particular are a frequent motif.) \u201cIt loves its children,\u201d Brackens says of his home state. Returning there, he reflects, \u201cI will feel all the love that I think comes with having a connection to that place.\u201d"], "authors": ["Marley Marius", "Marley Mariu"], "keywords": ["comes", "cotton", "think", "southern", "diedrick", "plumbs", "artist", "museum", "york", "yarn", "roots", "x", "work", "textile", "brackens", "darling", "divined"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
