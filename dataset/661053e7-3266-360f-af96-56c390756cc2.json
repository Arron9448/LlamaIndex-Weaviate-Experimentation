He brought out a standard chessboard, and we played a game. He said he\u2019d learned chess from Dan Bilzerian, the Instagram influencer, professional poker player, and former Presidential candidate. (He dropped out of the 2016 race and endorsed Donald Trump.) \u201cHe\u2019s the one person who beats me,\u201d Lesh said. Usually, around these parts, Lesh continued, he had to play without his queen to keep the games fair. By the time he beat me, he had two queens.", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014my pet turtle Freddy is trained to get help in these situations and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s halfway to the castle by now.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Tim Hamilton", "Downstairs, at a kitchen island, Lesh told me that there was a warrant out for his arrest. Stephen Laiche, his lawyer in Grand Junction, had strongly advised him to delete the Maroon Lake post. (\u201cTaking a picture of yourself taking a dump is just gross,\u201d Laiche recalls saying to himself. \u201cThink that\u2019s going to help you sell more clothes?\u201d) Lesh didn\u2019t want to. Laiche quit and filed a motion to be removed from the case. At the subsequent hearing\u2014held remotely by phone, owing to the pandemic\u2014Lesh, out of confusion or intransigence, failed to call in at the appointed time, and the judge issued the arrest warrant. Lesh hoped to clear it all up with the judge the following morning, at his phone-in arraignment.", "The charges at hand had to do with two other Instagram incidents. Last April, with the Independence Pass charges still pending, and with the state\u2019s ski hills and public lands shut down because of COVID, Lesh decided to poke the bear. He posted a couple of photos of him snowmobiling off a jump in a closed terrain park at the Keystone ski area, which, like Breckenridge, is operated by the company that owns Vail ski resort, on land belonging to the Forest Service. Lesh wrote, \u201cSolid park sesh, no lift ticket needed. #FuckVailResorts.\u201d This was trespassing, not just trolling. Keystone alerted the Forest Service and the sheriff\u2019s office, which launched a new investigation. Lesh wrote, in a new post, \u201cThose money hungry half-wits decimate wilderness around the world, build lifts, lodges, and resorts, and treat their customers and employees like shit . . . people flock by the millions and pay $200/day to ski there. I post a picture, harming no one . . . everyone loses their minds.\u201d", "Soon afterward, Lesh posted another provocation: a picture of him standing atop a mossy fallen tree trunk that bisects Hanging Lake. The lake, an hour\u2019s hike from the road, in Glenwood Canyon, is a popular and much photographed Colorado landmark, known for its aquamarine shallows and surrounding waterfalls and cliffs of mottled travertine. The Forest Service bans swimming there, and also fishing, dogs, and drones. A sign prohibits walking on the downed trunk, but there was Lesh on Instagram, out in the middle of the lake, shirtless, in a bathing suit: \u201cTesting out our new board shorts (coming soon) on the world\u2019s most famous log.\u201d The comments came in hard and fast, a few praising the mischief (\u201cLegend!\u201d) but most strafing him as an \u201centitled tool\u201d and a \u201cfuckwit\u201d who had desecrated one of Colorado\u2019s most sacred sites for the purpose of pitching his crappy gear.", "Lesh eventually settled the Independence Pass charges (he wound up with a five-hundred-dollar fine and fifty hours of community service), but not long afterward the U.S. Attorney in Grand Junction announced that the Feds were charging him with six new misdemeanors, relating to the incidents at Keystone and Hanging Lake. Each carried a possible jail term of up to six months. In setting the conditions of Lesh\u2019s release, a judge ordered him to cease trespassing and breaking laws on public lands, and stipulated that any further violation would result in the forfeiture of his bond.", "Lesh, at the kitchen island, began parsing his legal troubles. \u201cI love the outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t take extra napkins or use disposable silverware. I\u2019m not wasteful. I\u2019ve never destroyed anything.\u201d He referred to his critics as \u201cenvironmental terrorists or extremists.\u201d With regard to Independence Pass, he went on, \u201cThey said I was in wilderness, I said I was not. They had zero evidence.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s some imaginary line drawn out there.\u201d (The wilderness-area line, though not painted on the tundra, is not imaginary.) He and his friend hadn\u2019t intended to ride on grass, but they had found themselves running out of snow on the way back to the road.", "As for Keystone: \u201cThese multimillion-dollar ski areas like Vail desecrate the wilderness more than one snowmobile can. They chop down trees, use water and electricity to make snow, and build lodges, lifts, and parking lots. Here I am\u2014or supposedly me\u2014with one misdemeanor, in a terrain park, and everyone goes nuts. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d", "An associate named Michelle Anderson, a former college-basketball player from Missouri, arrived and began working quietly on a laptop. Lesh said they\u2019d met on Bumble and had dated for a while, and when that trailed off he\u2019d hired her. He told me that she was the best employee he\u2019d ever had. He also accused her of peeing too loudly in the bathroom off the kitchen. \u201cI have a strong vagina,\u201d she said. It had been eight months since I\u2019d been in an office. Was this how people now spoke to one another at work?", "That afternoon, Lesh received an anonymous package containing what was supposed to look like dung but was probably just mud with a little straw\u2014he threw it in the trash. He\u2019d been getting a lot of these.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think Patagonia has to put up with this,\u201d Anderson said.", "\u201cThe more hate I got, the more people got behind me, from all over the world,\u201d Lesh said. \u201cThese people couldn\u2019t give two fucks about me walking on a log in Hanging Lake. It was an opportunity to reach a whole new group of people\u2014while really solidifying the customer base we already had.\u201d", "Lesh came over to me and, standing close, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to post this video next week.\u201d On his phone, he played a short sequence that purported to show that the Hanging Lake and Maroon Lake photos had been Photoshopped: the image of himself, and of his reflection in the water, being scrubbed into stock landscapes. If this video was real\u2014and who at this point could say\u2014he hadn\u2019t stood on the log or crapped in the lake after all. He\u2019d hoaxed an entire state, and the Feds.", "\u201cSo I\u2019ll release this and then we\u2019ll see how eager they are to take it to trial,\u201d Lesh said.", "I asked if he\u2019d told the judge or his lawyer about the Photoshopping. He said he\u2019d been reluctant to tell his lawyer: \u201cI wanted them to charge me with something. The only evidence they have is the photos I posted on Instagram, which I know are fake, because I faked them. I was pissed off about them charging me for the snowmobiling on Independence Pass with zero evidence. I realized they are quick to respond to public outcry. I wanted to bait them into charging me.\u201d", "He went on, \u201cI want to be able to post fake things to the Internet. That\u2019s my fucking right as an American.\u201d", "For lunch, we drove to a food court downtown, where Lesh said he liked to take dates so that he doesn\u2019t have to pay for their meals. \u201cI have to drive sane, because of the warrant,\u201d he said, and then proceeded to surge and swerve aggressively in and out of traffic in his souped-up black BMW, which had no rear license plate. Lesh declined to reveal Virtika\u2019s annual sales, though he claimed they were up thirty per cent since he\u2019d posted the photo at Hanging Lake; he said he owns the company outright and carries very little debt. \u201cPeople generally think we\u2019re bigger than we are,\u201d he told me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t sell it for less than three or five million dollars.\u201d His life is a tax deduction: his airplane, his cars, his snowmobiles. \u201cEverything\u2019s a writeoff. I pay myself next to nothing.\u201d In the past, he has laid himself off in the summer, in order to collect unemployment. He said he received an array of P.P.P. loans last spring. He manufactures the gear in China, ships it by sea, and sells mostly direct to consumers. It\u2019s not as rigorously designed and tested (or as expensive) as, say, the North Face\u2019s, or as uselessly fashionable as Moncler\u2019s. With its garish or industrial color schemes, baggy fits, and heavy materials, it draws its inspiration and utility from the terrain park, and targets groms and Newschoolers more than helipad dads or hang-dryers of reusable bread wrappers.", "People often run Lesh down as a trust-fund brat spending Daddy\u2019s money. In the intermountain West, such suspicion is justifiably pervasive. Lesh has never had a trust fund, but he does have a kind of twisted inheritance. His parents, who are divorced, are artists. His father, Scott, is the son and grandson of tool-and-die-factory owners from Chicago. (His grandfather lost both thumbs in the machines.) Scott Lesh made sculptures out of dead animals. He scavenged roadkill and whatever carcasses he could find and framed them in animated postures. Lesh\u2019s mother, a cellist, also from Chicago, is of Norwegian heritage.", "After David was born, the family moved to India, first to what is now Mumbai and then to two outlying towns, Palaspe and Panvel. Lesh\u2019s mother, with a guru and a couple of grants, pioneered the adaptation of Indian music for the cello. Lesh\u2019s father scoured hills and riverbanks for animal and human remains. Both parents recall that David basically did not stop crying for the first two years of his life. He learned to speak Hindi and Marathi, and attended a makeshift preschool with an instructor who taught in English. \u201cI was the only white kid in the entire town,\u201d Lesh recalled.", "\u201cWe were the only white family in a thirty-mile radius,\u201d his mother said.", "Not long before Lesh\u2019s sixth birthday, the onset of the first Iraq War and a fear of retribution from the locals, many of whom were Muslim, spurred the family, now with an infant daughter, to flee India for Madison, Wisconsin. The parents got teaching jobs. \u201cWe were fucking broke,\u201d Lesh said. \u201cFood stamps, hand-me-downs.\u201d Lesh, blue-eyed and blond-haired, spoke English with an Indian accent. He was an outcast, a weird kid with weird parents, and he struggled to find friends.", "\u201cMy plan was to do really well and become a business consultant, like my mother\u2019s brother, who was forty and fucking hot doctor chicks,\u201d Lesh said. \u201cHe was the first person I knew who had a cell phone. I never wanted to be a broke artist like my parents. But in middle school I stopped caring. I was a little hooligan.\u201d He was expelled in eighth grade for calling in a bomb threat, and in high school became known as Bomb Threat Boy. The guys he skied with, at a scrappy local hill called Tyrol Basin, called him the Criminal. By now, he and a gang of friends were stealing cars and motorcycles and boosting liquor from distribution warehouses. He was in and out of jail. At one point, he appeared as a plaintiff on the syndicated court-TV program \u201cJudge Mathis,\u201d trying to get a girl who had thrown a glass bottle at his new car to reimburse the cost of repairs. \u201cHe\u2019s cynical,\u201d the girl told the judge. \u201cHe\u2019s a little jerk.\u201d The judge ruled in Lesh\u2019s favor. By senior year, he was living in a house with friends, dealing pot, and skiing competitively. For a time, out on probation, he wore an ankle bracelet, which on one occasion he cut off in order to enter a ski competition out of state. He got third place, and two weeks back in jail. Somehow, he managed to graduate from high school, and then began vagabonding around the West, racking up minor felonies for reckless motorcycling, and halfheartedly attending community college. Eventually, he ditched school and focussed on skiing.", "After Lesh graduated from high school, his mother moved back to India. \u201cHe was impossible,\u201d she said, of his teen-age years. \u201cEvery day was a nightmare for me.\u201d She now lives in Turkey.", "Lesh had suggested that he fly me in his plane somewhere for dinner\u2014over the mountains to Crested Butte, perhaps, or down to Colorado Springs. Single engine, small cockpit, Front Range updrafts, a pilot with a penchant for foolishness: I had misgivings.", "For one, there was the time when he crashed a new plane into the waters off Half Moon Bay, California. He had taken to the air with a friend, with a plan to be photographed flying over the Golden Gate Bridge. Another friend trailed in a second small plane, to get the shot. Lesh\u2019s engine conked out, and he skipped into the Pacific, four miles off the coast. He filmed the whole ordeal, while his friend sent out a Mayday call. They treaded water for forty-five minutes, waiting for the Coast Guard to arrive. Lesh\u2019s poise under duress, his Virtika sweatshirt, and his history of attention-seeking soon led people to suspect that the whole thing was staged."], "authors": ["Nick Paumgarten", "Nick Paumgarte"], "keywords": ["great", "ski", "leshs", "parents", "post", "judge", "school", "trolling", "hed", "told", "lesh", "outdoors", "lake"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
