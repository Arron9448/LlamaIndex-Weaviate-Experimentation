It has commissioned consultants to advise it on first of all understanding where all the PPE that has been bought actually is. It sounds like a strange question but it is a really big issue because it is not all standing neatly in an NHS store somewhere.", "\u201cWe have amounts in containers, in storage around the country, there\u2019s some on the docks and there is some en route somewhere from China.\u201d", "Concern over shortages of PPE was a marked feature of the early phase of the pandemic last year as countries around the world scrambled for scarce supplies as the disease spread across the globe.", "Frontline staff in both health and social care experienced shortages of PPE, with some forced to reuse single-use items as stocks ran low.", "In July, Rishi Sunak allocated \u00a315bn to procure masks, gowns and gloves \u2013 a sum that dwarfs the entire spending of other Whitehall departments.", "Davies said the task of evaluating how much the stock was worth would also mean assessing when the equipment went beyond its \u201cuse by\u201d date.", "\u201cEvaluating that [PPE] accurately for the 31 March for the accounts is a really difficult proposition \u2013 it is not one that can be avoided because it is a very material sum this year. Fifteen billion pounds has been budgeted to spend on it in the year.", "\u201cWe have been working with the department and their consultants to understand how they are getting a handle of where the material is and then how it is being valued, including the issue that I know the committee has been interested in, the age of the stock and at what stage does it become unusable and therefore valueless.\u201d", "The government has been criticised for an over-reliance upon outside consultants during the pandemic.", "The DHSC has been approached for a comment and has been asked why it did not have a system in place to track PPE stocks; which consultants it had hired to locate its PPE stocks, and how much the consultants were being paid every week."], "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "keywords": ["uk", "working", "sum", "whitehall", "stocks", "consultants", "accounts", "sure", "pounds", "equipment", "billions", "task", "ppe", "worth"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
