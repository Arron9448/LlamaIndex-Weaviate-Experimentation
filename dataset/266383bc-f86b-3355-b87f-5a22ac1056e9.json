{"paragraphs": ["Fans of Madden\u2019s franchise mode got some improvements to their favorite part of the game, but the mode wasn\u2019t wholly transformed since they were layered on top of a structure that hasn\u2019t changed in years. Until EA decides to scrap the mode\u2019s foundations \u2013 in particular the simulation engine \u2013 no real progress can be made.", "The Foundations of the Franchise", "The heart of a franchise mode is the behind-the-scenes sim engine which produces everything not determined directly on the playing field, from free agency to the draft and the league\u2019s stats. Given that the whole mode is precisely about what happens in the front offices of the NFL teams, this is a crucial part.", "Unfortunately it\u2019s a part that the series consistently gets wrong. The A.I. governing the actions of the other teams makes ne\u2019er do well teams like the Jets look like bonafide serial geniuses. Here are just a few examples.", "You can dupe the A.I. into bad trades by making them give up too many assets for a player \u2013 even a mediocre one \u2013 because it over-values players at positions of need.", "It doesn\u2019t draft correctly because it can\u2019t project growth in or develop its current players, so it sees the QB it just drafted for a team rated under an 80 (he is a rookie, after all), and thinks it has to draft another QB in the following draft.", "In the early and middle of the first round of the draft it also picks players at positions not normally drafted that high such as centers, guards, safeties, and tight ends. This is compounded by the A.I. thinking there\u2019s a run at those positions, causing it to choose more players at those lower-priority spots because it\u2019s fooled itself into thinking it\u2019s going to miss out on grabbing the fourth-best center in the first round.", "Most A.I.-controlled players negotiating new contracts are simple to sign because they don\u2019t have a sense of their real value on the market.", "The sim engine can\u2019t tabulate stats correctly through the season, whether it\u2019s not producing enough yards for running QBs or not giving them enough INTs. This skews the entire backstory of the year and the league as a whole.", "These are all specific examples of the game not getting it right behind the scenes, and they add up to a big problem for the mode, keeping it from evolving. What use is adding a new feature like the Scenario Engine, which surfaces players\u2019 opinions to you as a coach during the season, if the game can\u2019t even correctly coordinate what happens afterwards? I\u2019ve seen times where a player complains they aren\u2019t getting the ball enough, you give them a great stat line in the next game, and they still complain.", "Madden developer EA Tiburon could totally overhaul its draft, filling it with flashy videos and player stories, but if there\u2019s not a single A.I. initiated trade in the first round \u2013 which there usually isn\u2019t \u2013 then the actual drama and importance of the whole event is lost. It\u2019s this kind of fundamental disconnect between how the mode is serviced and how it actually performs that is frustrating year in and year out. It\u2019s not just an example of the mode not reaching its full potential or not delivering the moon, it\u2019s actively sabotaging itself.", "Maybe the next-generation can help usher in a new era for the series\u2019 Franchise mode with improved simulation logic.
