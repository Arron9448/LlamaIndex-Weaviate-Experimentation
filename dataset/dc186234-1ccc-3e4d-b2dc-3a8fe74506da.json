Scientists say the world is severely lagging in tackling the climate crisis and its heatwaves, storms and floods, with planet-heating emissions set to roar back following a dip due to coronavirus shutdowns.", "Much will hinge upon cooperation between China, the world\u2019s worst producer of planet-heating emissions, and the US, historically the worst polluter. On Saturday, John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, struck an agreement in Shanghai to urgently address what Kerry called the \u201cbeyond catastrophic\u201d consequences of allowing temperatures to spiral upwards.", "The compact is broadly seen as encouraging but comes amid US-China tensions on issues including human rights and trade. The US also faces a deficit in credibility after the presidency of Donald Trump, which saw the country leave the Paris climate accords and dismantle environmental protections.", "Biden has returned the US to the Paris agreement but a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said the move was \u201cby no means a glorious comeback but rather the student playing truant getting back to class\u201d.", "The US is suffering from a \u201ccredibility gap\u201d due to years of oscillating policy, according to Josh Busby, an expert in climate governance at University of Texas-Austin.", "\u201cThe US return to climate diplomacy may be taken seriously so long as the Biden administration can keep its climate policy agenda alive,\u201d he said.", "On Monday Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, acknowledged America was \u201cfalling behind\u201d China in producing solar panels and electric vehicles but promised a muscular approach in prodding other countries to do more.", "\u201cOur diplomats will challenge the practices of countries whose action, or inaction, is setting us back,\u201d Blinken said.", "\u201cWhen countries continue to rely on coal for a significant amount of their energy, or invest in new coal factories, or allow for massive deforestation, they will hear from the United States and our partners about how harmful these actions are.\u201d", "The centerpiece of Biden\u2019s summit will be the unveiling of the new US emissions reduction target, which may be the only significant new pledge at the event. The goal is expected to be at least a 50% cut by 2030, based on 2005 levels, a target broadly backed by environment groups as well as the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has said 2021 \u201cmust be the year for action\u201d to avoid an \u201cabyss\u201d of climate disaster.", "Anything below a 50% cut will be seen as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to US allies in Europe, said Samantha Gross, director of energy security at Brookings Institution.", "\u201cAll eyes are on the US plan \u2013 it will be crucial to American climate diplomacy,\u201d said Rachel Kyte, an expert in international relations at Tufts University and a UN adviser.", "\u201cIf it is robust and they can walk the talk and actually implement policies, that will help build momentum. Time is our enemy, it is the one resource we don\u2019t have. There is so much catching up to do from the last four years and we really need to gather speed.\u201d", "Joanna Lewis, a specialist in Chinese energy policy at Georgetown University, said the US-China climate commitment was an \u201cencouraging step\u201d, including language that suggests China could make make deeper emissions cuts than previously promised.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important that Biden puts an ambitious target on the table but it\u2019s equally important that he implements legislation to meet those targets,\u201d she said. \u201cBarack Obama set goals but wasn\u2019t able to do the meaningful legislation, unlike, for example, the UK.\u201d", "Biden also faces pressure at home. Scientists and lawmakers are pressing for specific curbs on methane, a potent greenhouse gas released during oil and gas drilling. Some activists were underwhelmed by Biden proposing just $1.2bn in international climate aid in his first budget. Others are keen for Biden to reinstate a US ban on crude oil exports.", "\u201cI am risking my life to stop the reckless destruction of my community,\u201d said Diane Wilson, a shrimper who has been on hunger strike for two weeks to protest the expansion of an oil export terminal in Lavaca Bay, Texas.", "\u201cOil and gas export terminals like the project I am fighting pollute our air, water and climate, only to pad the pockets of fossil fuel CEOs. The Biden administration needs to stop the dredging and stop oil and gas exports.\u201d", "While the Biden administration is expected to largely focus on its emissions reduction target during the summit, it has been keen to stress it shares environmentalists\u2019 sense of urgency.", "\u201cIf America fails to lead the world on addressing the climate crisis, we won\u2019t have much of a world left,\u201d said Blinken."], "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "keywords": ["stop", "major", "summit", "emissions", "university", "oil", "world", "faces", "target", "joe", "climate", "biden", "gas", "credibility", "building", "test"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
