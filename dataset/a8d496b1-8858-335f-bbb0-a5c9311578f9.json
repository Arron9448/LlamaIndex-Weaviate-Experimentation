Every driver on the grid would like to drive a Ferrari.", "\u201cWe have a long-term agreement with one driver [Charles Leclerc] and with the other driver [Sebastian Vettel] the agreement expires at the end of 2020. It would be premature to decide anything now. We will look at our options and see what is the best fit for our team.\u201d", "Hamilton, who will be 35 next month, has indicated his next move will depend on the future of Wolff. The 47-year-old Mercedes team principal has been touted by the sport\u2019s American owners\u2019 Liberty Media as a prime candidate to take over from Chase Carey and run F1 beyond next year.", "Camilleri said Ferrari would be prepared to use their veto to stop Wolff, who has presided over Mercedes\u2019 unprecedented run of success in recent years, being handed the keys to the sport.", "\u201cAnybody who has been an active and important player in a certain team within the last years to take on the responsibility at F1 would create a conflict of interest,\u201d Camilleri said. \u201cIt would not be a good thing that Wolff should ultimately run F1.", "\u201cOur position is if [Ferrari team principal] Mattia Binotto was the candidate to replace Chase, the rest of the paddock would not be too happy. Our veto is the last resort tool. Should we be confronted with that [Wolff taking over from Carey] we would explain our position quite clearly to the folks at Liberty.\u201d", "Ferrari\u2019s campaign was blighted by a series of errors by their drivers and strategical mistakes. Leclerc\u2019s breakthrough season also forced Ferrari to drop Vettel as their No 1 driver. The four-times world champion, who is paid \u00a336m a year, would be moved on if the Italians signed Hamilton.", "\u201cClearly Charles\u2019 performance has had an impact,\u201d Camilleri said. \u201cThat\u2019s inevitable when you\u2019re the world champion and this young kid comes along and has a phenomenal season. Charles has a lot of talent. He has surprised even ourselves as to what he has been capable of.", "\u201cTheir collision last month in Brazil was a nightmare. However, the air has been cleared. And sometimes you need a crisis to put the goalposts in the appropriate place. Going forwards it gives Mattia a much better way of managing them because they realised how much they screwed up.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["mercedes", "driver", "charles", "wolff", "season", "team", "f1", "flattered", "talks", "world", "run", "hamilton", "lewis", "ferrari", "camilleri"], "id": "a8d496b1-8858-335f-bbb0-a5c9311578f9", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "title": "Ferrari \u2018very flattered\u2019 Lewis Hamilton has had talks about F1 move"}
