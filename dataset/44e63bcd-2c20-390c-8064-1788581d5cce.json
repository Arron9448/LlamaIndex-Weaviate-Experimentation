Which is to say that it\u2019s an essay-film, a film of ideas, that are for the most part expressed by Peck himself, in his own voice-over, which nearly fills the movie\u2019s soundtrack from start to finish. The four-hour film is in the vein of Peck\u2019s previous essay-film, \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d which focusses on James Baldwin\u2019s work. \u201cExterminate All the Brutes\u201d is similarly an intellectual effort. And, like \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d it introduces and distills, from Peck\u2019s own perspective, extant writings, this time by three historians who study colonialism and racism. Unlike the earlier film, though, the new one doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of film clips from the writers themselves, and doesn\u2019t (at least, doesn\u2019t claim to) quote directly from their work. It is literally a film in Peck\u2019s voice, and that strength, and that audacity, also gives rise to its artistic peculiarities.", "\u201cExterminate All the Brutes\u201d presents a thesis that Peck takes care to frame as a narrative\u2014and an extraordinary, powerful, urgent one. The movie borrows from the work of historians\u2014the late Sven Lindqvist and Michel-Rolph Trouillot, and Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz\u2014all friends of Peck\u2019s. What he extracts from their work is something that he explicitly calls \u201ca story, not a contribution to historical research.\u201d The story that he tells is a vast one, a millennial one\u2014that of white supremacy, or, more specifically, whites\u2019 presumption to supremacy, a presumption that, as he makes clear, continues, to this day, to be asserted with violence and justified with lies. Peck ranges back to the Crusades, documenting the claims of white, Christian, European superiority as the argument for conquests in Asia. These events were soon followed by the Spanish Inquisition and its persecution of Jews and Muslims, and\u2014at the same time\u2014the voyage of Columbus to the New World and the genocidal destruction of indigenous peoples that his expedition, and the many explorers that followed, committed.", "Peck gathers a set of historical atrocities of vast geographical and historical scope\u2014the colonization of the New World by means of the genocide of Native Americans, the enslavement of Africans in the Americas, the imperial conquest of Africa by European powers, and the Holocaust\u2014and traces their inextricable connections, their shared theme of white supremacy. \u201cExterminate All the Brutes\u201d (the title, also that of a book by Lindqvist, is a line spoken by Kurtz in Joseph Conrad\u2019s novel \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d) offers, in effect, a unifying theory of white supremacy and its manifestations\u2014in conquest, in genocide, and in the myths and the pseudoscience by which the killers have justified themselves and continue to do so. As Peck says, \u201cThe road to Auschwitz was paved in the earliest days of Christendom, and this road also leads straight to the heart of America.\u201d", "What\u2019s more, working with historians, Peck puts the very writing of history at the core of the story; he understands history as the victors\u2019 record of events, and sees American national mythology as a fiction that depends on an assumed racism. A prime example is stated in a title card, \u201cThe Myth of Pristine Wilderness,\u201d and Peck develops the idea, stating that \u201cland with no people does not exist\u201d and that \u201conly through killing and displacement does it become uninhabited.\u201d The foundational myth of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the West\u2019s indigenous peoples becomes a tale of Western superiority and of white Europeans\u2019 justified domination, up to and including the extermination of indigenous people\u2014and the cultivation of the cleared land by way of the labor of enslaved Africans. The assumption is matched by the collective will to keep the resulting crimes silenced, the crimes that are the foundation of the Western world\u2019s wealth, Europe\u2019s monumental splendors, and America\u2019s industrial domination\u2014for that matter, its very essence. As Peck says, whiteness has served as \u201can authorization for abuse, a justification for eternal immunity.\u201d", "In the course of his research, Peck says, Lindqvist told him, \u201cYou already know enough . . . what is missing is the courage to understand what we know and to draw conclusions.\u201d Peck evokes some crucial historical connections that rarely appear in popular culture. For instance, in the myth of the eighteenth century\u2019s overlapping ages of ostensible enlightenment and revolution, he emphasizes that, unlike the colonial French and American Revolutions, which sought freedom for whites and subjection for Blacks, the Haitian Revolution of 1790 was undertaken in the name of liberation and equality\u2014and was also a crucial event in the development of the United States, when Napoleon, his colonial ambitions dashed, sold off French land in the Louisiana Purchase.", "Peck\u2019s thought moves with a bold and wondrous associative freedom that takes the film from the naval superiority that enabled Europe to dominate India and China to the crucial role of industrialized weaponry in colonial expansion, and to the ultimate crime of the ultimate weaponry\u2014the use of the atomic bomb against Japan, for which President Harry S. Truman offered an expressly racist justification. Through the misuse of the theory of evolution, the successful domination by Europe and the United States of nonwhite populations shifted, from the myth of a divinely ordained mission to the grotesque fiction of a scientific necessity. Thus, colonial wars in Africa, the elimination of Native American peoples, and the practice of slavery gave rise to the Holocaust\u2014which then came, in the European and American imaginations, to take the place of their own crimes. Peck says, \u201cWe would prefer for genocide to have begun and ended with Nazism\u201d\u2014even as he traces the connection of Nazis to the rhetoric, the symbolism, and the violence of current-day white supremacists.", "For Peck, the goal of his historical analysis isn\u2019t only to elucidate current events, it\u2019s to inspire activism and to achieve change: \u201cWhat must be denounced here is not so much the reality of the Native American genocide, or the reality of slavery, or the reality of the Holocaust; what needs to be denounced here are the consequences of these realities in our lives and in life today.\u201d Throughout, he refers to the anti-immigrant hostility of the current nationalist right wing and the prevalence of neo-Nazis and overt white supremacists in the United States and elsewhere. He presents, plainly, the fulsome self-satisfaction of contemporary hate-mongering potentates. (Among the leaders he shows are Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Marine Le Pen, and Boris Johnson.) Peck calls slavery in the United States \u201ca ghost,\u201d explaining that \u201cthe fact that U.S. slavery has both officially ended and yet continues in many complex forms of institutionalized racism makes its representation particularly burdensome.\u201d He looks to the prospect of reparations for Black Americans and \u201cself-determination and restitution\u201d for Native Americans, and considers that anything less will perpetuate and deepen past injustices.", "Peck\u2019s method is far more complex than his mere voice-over, however. He relies on dramatic scenes\u2014whether imagined re\u00ebnactments or counterhistorical fantasies\u2014to illustrate his ideas. (Josh Hartnett plays a wide range of white-supremacist monsters, such as the American General Thomas Sidney Jesup, who violated a truce with the Seminole chief Osceola; a murderous and grotesquely cruel Belgian colonial officer; and a nightmarish doctor who kills Black people in a laboratory setting as if they were animals in a slaughterhouse.) Another sequence imagines Columbus and his cohorts slaughtered on the beach by the indigenous people of Haiti (in a scene set to Charles Mingus\u2019s \u201cHaitian Fight Song\u201d); yet another imagines white children captured and enslaved by a Black slave master. These brief sequences are powerful but merely illustrative\u2014as, too, are clips from movies, made in Hollywood and elsewhere, whether showing John Wayne in \u201cThe Alamo\u201d or Adolf Hitler in Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s \u201cOlympia,\u201d a fictionalized sixteenth-century report on the massacre of indigenous people in \u201cDispute in Valladolid\u201d or the dispensing of death from the heights of a helicopter in \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d", "Clips from some of Peck\u2019s own films, such as \u201cHaitian Corner\u201d and \u201cThe School of Power,\u201d are included, too\u2014because Peck factors himself into the movie as well. He introduces his own story, briefly, in touches throughout\u2014his childhood in Haiti, in New York, in Congo; his fifteen-year residence in Berlin, his wide-ranging travels. He introduces members of his family, and\u2014in some of the most moving visual clips\u2014relies on his parents\u2019 home movies to recall his childhood and youth. With the self-conscious connection of his earlier, dramatic films to this first-person essay, he affirms that previously, as a filmmaker, he sought to \u201cstay hidden in the background,\u201d and made sure to \u201cavoid becoming the subject\u201d of his films. Here, by contrast, the enormity of the subject, he says, requires him to take conspicuous part, because \u201cneutrality is not an option.\u201d", "There\u2019s nothing neutral about Peck\u2019s voice-over; yet it\u2019s a disembodied voice, one that allows itself to be no place in particular. The filmmaker speaks from nowhere. That placelessness is conspicuous in what is in the film instead: the choice and arrangement of the images that the film mainly comprises, archival drawings and illustrations, historical documents that are selected and shown in a relatively rapid montage, complete with sound effects and a conventionally load-bearing musical score. (The one extraordinary trope of visual rhetoric in Peck\u2019s choice of archival photographs is the emphasis on the gazes of subjects into the camera; the effect, which recurs throughout the film, is that of a political challenge, a call to the bearing of witness.) \u201cExterminate All the Brutes\u201d is a work of prodigious and passionate research that doesn\u2019t show its work; the one moment in which Peck suggests a relationship to the archive\u2014that of Raphael Lemkin, the historian who coined the term \u201cgenocide,\u201d whose archives are at the New York Public Library\u2014has a physical, experiential resonance that most of the film is missing. The visual interventions (like the dramatic sequences and animated sequences, the home movies and film clips with which the series is interspersed) are either too much or too little\u2014they\u2019re neither sufficiently drastic to suggest an analytical reconfiguration of source documents nor sufficiently plain and hands-on to evoke the filmmaker\u2019s act of discovery and selection, to the presence and survival of archives laying untapped like the subject of the movie itself, in a violent silence. Breaking that silence, however, is the basis of the film, and its great achievement. How Peck tells the story of white supremacy matters less than the fact that, at last, it is indeed being comprehensively, insightfully, compendiously told."], "authors": ["Richard Brody", "Richard Brod"], "keywords": ["reviewed", "pecks", "genocide", "history", "vast", "film", "exterminate", "brutes", "peck", "agonizing", "historical", "american", "supremacy", "work", "indigenous", "white"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
