I get no enjoyment from eating.\u201d) Thirty-two percent reported enjoying intimacy less, and 66 percent reported feeling more anxiety. Hummel told me about a woman who came into his clinic and said she was more devastated by her smell loss than her breast cancer diagnosis.", "Smell is a crucial part of desire, from Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s alleged request to Josephine that she not bathe before he returned home from battle to the \u201clove apples\u201d of the Elizabethan era: peeled apples women would saturate with their underarm sweat.", "Hummel also told me that he has noticed consistent gaps between male and female anosmia patients: While men often complain about something related to taste, how their beer tastes like sudsy dishwater, women most frequently complain about something relational\u2014like not being able to smell their children. It doesn\u2019t take a postdoc in neurobiology to understand that smell is a crucial part of desire, from Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s alleged request to Josephine that she not bathe before he returned home from battle to the \u201clove apples\u201d of the Elizabethan era: peeled apples women would saturate with their underarm sweat before giving them to their beloveds. And if you lose your sense of smell, then you lose an important key to many of the memories that compose your sense of identity. As Afif Aqrabawi, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at MIT who studies the relationship between smell and memory, told me, it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t have the memories anymore but that they aren\u2019t being triggered with the same level of visceral immediacy. To put it simply: You have fewer emotional experiences each day. Bradley Goldstein, M.D., an ENT surgeon and scientist at Duke University, told me about an anosmia patient who returned home to the Caribbean island where she\u2019d grown up and, because she couldn\u2019t smell anything\u2014the flowers, the air, her mother\u2019s cooking\u2014didn\u2019t even feel like she\u2019d arrived: \u201cI just started crying. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not even here.\u2019 \u201d When you lose smell, you are not only losing the world around you\u2014one patient described it as \u201cliving in a box\u201d\u2014but also losing access to the internal landscape of your own past. As another patient put it: \u201cI live in a permanent present.\u201d", "When Aqrabawi described one of the experiments he runs with his mice, in which he motivates them to dig for chocolate by triggering the memory of the smell of chocolate\u2014actually, the smell of Nutella\u2014he told me that they eventually end up getting so agitated by the absence of chocolate that they start eating wood chips. It\u2019s the mismatch between what they perceive and what\u2019s actually there that aggravates them. Hearing about their agitation summoned memories from earlier this year of eating spoonfuls of Nutella that tasted like mahogany-\u00adbrown glue, though my frustration had been the opposite of theirs: Something was there, but I couldn\u2019t perceive it. I wasn\u2019t experiencing just the loss of pleasure\u2014though losing the taste of Nutella is a grave wound, indeed\u2014but the disorienting vertigo of that gap between my senses and the world.", "When you lose smell, you are not only losing the world around you but also losing access to the internal landscape of your own past.", "Many people struggling with long-term anosmia report that others often forget their condition or trivialize it. \u201cIt is a disablement that is invisible,\u201d says one patient. \u201cPeople are always saying, \u2018Smell that,\u2019 \u2018Taste this.\u2019 It is very annoying; you wouldn\u2019t tell a blind man to look at the lovely scenery.\u201d Chrissi Kelly, a mother living in Hampshire, England, who lost her sense of smell after a bad sinus infection in 2012, felt that one of the hardest parts was the impossibility of explaining the loss: \u201cPeople think, Okay, I\u2019ll hold my nose and that\u2019ll be it. But it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s elemental, as if I said, \u2018Imagine a world without gravity.\u2019 \u201d Kelly sank into clinical depression about six months into her anosmia\u2014what she describes as a \u201ccold bell descending over my head\u201d\u2014and hit \u201crock bottom\u201d a few months later, deeply missing smell as \u201cthe thing that makes you feel like you\u2019re actually a part of the universe and not just a shadow.\u201d It was after two years of anosmia that Kelly finally started to smell again, and she remembers the experience vividly: She and her husband were driving down a winding mountain road past a towering pile of freshly cut logs. She told her husband to pull over and got out of the car, knelt down by the side of the road, and brought palmfuls of sawdust close to her face\u2014it had just rained, so the shavings were damp and fragrant. To this day, she told me, the smell of lumber still brings her right back to the sensation of dropping to her knees on that mountainside."], "authors": ["Leslie Jamison", "Leslie Jamiso"], "keywords": ["writers", "scentless", "patient", "anosmia", "caused", "lose", "smellone", "life", "journey", "loss", "sense", "apples", "millions", "losing", "covid", "eating", "told", "smell"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
