Could this marine grain be edible?", "Lab tests hinted at its tremendous potential: gluten-free, high in omega-6 and -9 fatty acids, and contains 50% more protein than rice per grain, according to Aponiente\u2019s research. And all of it growing without freshwater or fertiliser.", "The find has set the chef, whose restaurant won its third Michelin star in 2017, on a mission to recast the common eelgrass as a potential superfood, albeit one whose singular lifecycle could have far-reaching consequences. \u201cIn a world that is three-quarters water, it could fundamentally transform how we see oceans,\u201d says Le\u00f3n. \u201cThis could be the beginning of a new concept of understanding the sea as a garden.\u201d", "It\u2019s a sweeping statement that would raise eyebrows from anyone else. But Le\u00f3n, known across Spain as el Chef del Mar (the chef of the sea), has long pushed the boundaries of seafood, fashioning chorizos out of discarded fish parts and serving sea-grown versions of tomatoes and pears at his restaurant near the Bay of C\u00e1diz.", "The tiny grains within the eelgrass. The plant is capable of capturing carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests.

His efforts to bring little-known marine species to the fore were recognised in 2010 with his first Michelin star. By the time the restaurant earned its third star, Le\u00f3n had become a fixture on Spain\u2019s gastronomy scene: a trailblazing chef determined to redefine how we treat the sea.", "What Le\u00f3n and his team refer to as \u201cmarine grain\u201d expands on this, in one of his most ambitious projects to date. After stumbling across the grain in 2017, Le\u00f3n began looking for any mention of Zostera marina being used as food. He finally found an article from 1973 in the journal Science on how it was an important part of the diet of the Seri, an Indigenous people living on the Gulf of California in Sonora, Mexico, and the only known case of a grain from the sea being used as a human food source.", "Next came the question of whether the perennial plant could be cultivated. In the Bay of C\u00e1diz, the once-abundant plant had been reduced to an area of just four sq metres, echoing a decline seen around the world as seagrass meadows reel from increased human activity along coastlines and steadily rising water temperatures.", "Working with a team at the University of C\u00e1diz and researchers from the regional government, a pilot project was launched to adapt three small areas across a third of a hectare (0.75 acres) of salt marshes into what Le\u00f3n calls a \u201cmarine garden\u201d.", "It was not until 18 months later \u2013 after the plants had produced grains \u2013 that Le\u00f3n steeled himself for the ultimate test, said Juan Mart\u00edn, Aponiente\u2019s environmental manager.", "Salt marshes near C\u00e1diz were used to create a \u2018marine garden\u2019 where the eelgrass seeds could be sown. Photograph: \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez Prieto/Aponiente", "\u201c\u00c1ngel came to me, his tone very serious, and said: \u2018Juan, I would like to have some grains because I have no idea how it tastes. Imagine if it doesn\u2019t taste good,\u2019\u201d says Mart\u00edn. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. He threw himself into it blindly, invested his own money, and he had never even tried this marine grain.\u201d", "Le\u00f3n put the grain through a battery of recipes, grinding it to make flour for bread and pasta and steeping it in flavours to mimic Spain\u2019s classic rice dishes.", "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. When you eat it with the husk, similar to brown rice, it has a hint of the sea at the end,\u201d says Le\u00f3n. \u201cBut without the husk, you don\u2019t taste the sea.\u201d He found that the grain absorbed flavour well, taking two minutes longer to cook than rice and softening if overcooked.", "In the marine garden, Le\u00f3n and his team were watching as the plant lived up to its reputation as an architect of ecosystems: transforming the abandoned salt marsh into a flourishing habitat teeming with life, from seahorses to scallops.", "The plant\u2019s impact could stretch much further. Capable of capturing carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and described by the WWF as an \u201cincredible tool\u201d in fighting the climate crisis, seagrass absorbs 10% of the ocean\u2019s carbon annually despite covering just 0.2% of the seabed.", "News of what Le\u00f3n and his team were up to soon began making waves around the world. \u201cWhen I first heard of it, I was going \u2018Wow, this is very interesting,\u2019\u201d says Robert Orth, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who has spent more than six decades studying seagrass. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone that has attempted to do what this chef has done.\u201d", "We\u2019ve opened a window. It's a new way to feed ourselves", "According to Orth, seagrass has been used as insulation for houses, roofing material and even for packing seafood, but never cultivated as food. It is an initiative riddled with challenges. Wild seagrass meadows have been dying off at an alarming rate in recent decades, while few researchers have managed to successfully transplant and grow seagrass, he says.", "In southern Spain, however, the team\u2019s first marine garden suggests potential average harvests could be about 3.5 tonnes a hectare. While the yield is about a third of what one could achieve with rice, Le\u00f3n points to the potential for low-cost and environmentally friendly cultivation. \u201cIf nature gifts you with 3,500kg without doing anything \u2013 no antibiotics, no fertiliser, just seawater and movement \u2013 then we have a project that suggests one can cultivate marine grain.\u201d", "A pilot project was successful in cultivating seagrass and obtaining grains that \u00c1ngel Le\u00f3n then tried in different recipes. Photograph: www.MAPDIGITAL.es", "The push is now on to scale up the project, adapting as much as five hectares of salt marshes into areas for cultivating eelgrass. Every success is carefully tracked, in hopes of better understanding the conditions \u2013 from water temperature to salinity \u2013 that the plant needs to thrive.", "While it is likely to be years before the grain becomes a staple at Aponiente, Le\u00f3n\u2019s voice rises with excitement as he considers the transformative possibility of Zostera marina\u2019s minuscule, long-overlooked grain \u2013 and its reliance on only seawater for irrigation. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s like everything,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you respect the areas in the sea where this grain is being grown, it would ensure humans take care of it. It means humans would defend it.\u201d", "He and his team envision a global reach for their project, paving the way for people to harness the plant\u2019s potential to boost aquatic ecosystems, feed populations and fight the climate crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened a window,\u201d says Le\u00f3n. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a new way to feed ourselves.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ashifa Kassam"], "keywords": ["change", "team", "restaurant", "project", "rice", "sea", "eats", "le\u00f3n", "humanity", "tiny", "potential", "marine", "grain", "way", "seagrass"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
