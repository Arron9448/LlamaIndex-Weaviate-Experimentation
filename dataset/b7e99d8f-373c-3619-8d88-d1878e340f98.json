Blockchain services at IBM.\nBecause when we think about what we all care about,if we have family and friends, it's all about the people,you know, that's what we identify with.\nIt's trust, right?\nWould you think that's a good idea?\nWhat needs to change is first awareness,and also this understanding that there's a business outcomeand that the B word isn't everything.", "paragraphs": ["Transcript", "[upbeat music]", "Hi, thanks for being here today Jason.", "All right Scott.", "Yeah, so we, let's see,", "you're wearing a shirt that says IBM Blockchain,", "and you are the GM of Blockchain services at IBM.", "And we just watched a video", "that was about Hurricane Harvey and paperwork,", "so can you connect the dots for us on that?", "Okay, that's a good intro,", "so I would have maybe reeled it back", "and just started with I'm Jason Kelley,", "and I identify as he and him.", "I am a army veteran, so pre happy Veterans Day,", "I am a proud father of three kids", "with a wonderful wife that lives in Austin, Texas.", "And I'm a believer in tech for good.", "So why do I start that way?", "It's because what you just asked me.", "Because when we think about what we all care about,", "if we have family and friends, it's all about the people,", "you know, that's what we identify with.", "I have a history of service and when you see", "what you just saw, why show that story?", "What does that mean?", "Hurricane Harvey?", "Well think about forest fires in California,", "they are dramatic events, and guess what?", "There's gonna be more of them.", "And so think about what happens", "when your home is burned down,", "or there's been high winds or water, and you're asked,", "Hey, can you give us your property records?", "And by the way, can you use those property records", "to tie that into the insurance agency.", "And also there's this service organization", "that wants to help you, and all these things", "have to happen, and you say,", "Oh wait, how can I tie this together?", "I don't have that, all these different things", "have to come together.", "And that's the challenge.", "That's what we think about when we think about", "what we care about.", "And I've yet to say anything about the B word.", "So, so we'll get to that.", "[Scott] That's my job, right?", "That's your job.", "So I'll ask about it, so I mean those are serious problems", "but how is Blockchain used different in that instance,", "than something like a database,", "or more conventional technologies that I think", "we're all familiar with?", "So we think about a database,", "and that's all Blockchain is.", "So anyone, your Blockchain 101 and all it's challenges,", "explain Blockchain in 30 seconds,", "well if you can then you got a job, right?", "Just think of a database, and there's always been databases,", "that's all it is is a glorified database,", "distributed database.", "And what it gives you is trusted access to data,", "permission to access.", "And that's always been elusive,", "to be able to take different players", "and only show them in a database, what you want them to see,", "in a permission way.", "So that you can have entities that may be at odds,", "or competition, and they can see the same thing,", "and then second, when you see the data, it's the right data.", "So think about Hurricane Harvey,", "think about forest fires in California,", "all of a sudden you don't have the stacks of paper", "like you saw in the quick short.", "Instead, what you have is this capability to say,", "it's already digital,", "my insurance company can see what I had,", "can look at the titling agency,", "the federal agencies can talk to the state agencies,", "can talk to the city.", "All these challenges now become very simple", "if you have this magical B word,", "I'll let you guess what that B word is,", "that now brings it together.", "That now you can say, wait, we can now share that data", "and we can get to a solution for people,", "which is the only reason you should be using technology", "is to get some kind of outcome,", "not just for technologies sake.", "And that's what we've seen now work", "for people, for good tech, you know,", "taking tech for good.", "Right, and I think one of the things", "you actually wanted me to talk to you about", "was the hype question, so how much of what we saw", "in that video is something that's able to happen right now,", "versus something that we're looking to see happen", "over the next five, 10, 15 years.", "And great pick up there Scott,", "because maybe by my demeanor and I'm sure the audience", "and those watching virtually can tell.", "It is hyped, Blockchain is hyped,", "however, everything that we just saw is real", "from a sense that we have many clients right now", "around the world that are using this capability", "to transact, to have trusted transactions,", "and that's all we're doing is trying to return trust", "to things that we exchange.", "Exchange a value, whether it's replacing a home,", "whether it's cashing a check,", "or knowing your identification,", "and trust is at the center of this", "and this new capability is the new OS for trust.", "And what does the rollout", "of something like that look like,", "because I imagine after a natural disaster", "you have a lot of different organizations", "that are trying to figure things out,", "it's in chaos, like, how do you make this real?", "So when you say, Make it real,", "it gets to the heart of it, is that the technology is real.", "The technology is working,", "the tough part is not the technology,", "technology is 10% of it, it's so easy.", "The tough part is getting everyone", "to change their business models,", "change their process to use the technology.", "Think about how long it took North America", "to say, Oh, we should be using chips in our credit cards.", "I was living in China in South East Asia,", "years before that all my American cards were trash", "because we don't use that, you don't have a chip, right?", "And then it was a miracle when we got it.", "So it's all about changing the system.", "And so that has become the art", "which is how do you get these processes changed", "and how do you get these organizations", "to work differently together?", "And that's a little bit more art than science.", "And it seems like a lot of that is really", "about cooperation versus sometimes competitions,", "so does the Blockchain,", "so I'll be the one to keep say that [laughs]", "is it ever--", "[Jason] Let's say Jason never said the word.", "Is it ever a lever to get people to do things", "that they maybe otherwise wouldn't?", "Because it's exciting, interesting, different--", "And that's it, the lever is the outcome,", "that's why we all do something,", "we're gonna do something because we get an outcome.", "It's trust, right?", "And that's what you get, that trust and transparency,", "and we think, I mean, you can't,", "how many people in the audience, as you look at me,", "how many people eat organic food?", "And for those that can't see that,", "everyone raised their hand by the way in the audience.", "[laughs]", "Now, so of those who raised your hands,", "so you pay that extra dollar or two for that food.", "Now, little known fact,", "is that there's more organic food consumed than is produced.", "[audience member laughing]", "Yeah, listen to that, yeah, it takes a second.", "So what?", "So we inherently trust what we read,", "and so if I were to tell you, guess what,", "the next time you pick up that loaf of bread, or that box,", "and I can guarantee to you the provenance of", "that product that is actually organic,", "where you now pay an extra 25 cents,", "so now I've just given you an increased outcome,", "a guarantee of a provenance of organic,", "and would you pay a little bit more?", "Probably.", "Or I'd say, you know,", "federal agency, you can now close your books", "within a month of a disaster because you were able", "to see in real time what the state saw, what the city saw,", "and you've settled the claim, you know,", "with a confident citizen that can now believe", "and trust in the system.", "Would you think that's a good idea?", "So I think what brings the coalescing capability", "is built on this trusted outcome,", "and that's why I do call it the OS for trust.", "Got it, and broadening the lens a bit", "because I think some of these examples", "have been really interesting,", "how else do you see this technology being used for good", "over the next five years, or 10 years?", "I think as we start to move forward you'll see", "where a lot of the organizations and things", "that we want to see move better,", "we just heard Chris Cox on stage talk about", "the environment and sustainability,", "and you think about how do you know that", "that cobalt that's being mined can actually be, you know,", "is responsibly mined in the first place,", "and then how do we know that it's mined in a proper way?", "How do we know, or how can we even flip it,", "how can we turn trash that's in the sea", "into a currency by tokenizing it,", "and that's not crypto tokenize,", "this is just saying tokenize,", "so that now in developing countries,", "you could actually exchange that for goods,", "using this database because you know that that is,", "it's not double spent,", "you haven't turned that bottle in twice and", "that in fact that commodity has now been exchanged", "because it's all right there in a shared database,", "trusted access, permission access,", "with indelible quality of data.", "And I know we're running short on time,", "but what's stopping us from getting there sooner?", "What needs to change?", "What needs to change is first awareness,", "and also this understanding that there's a business outcome", "and that the B word isn't everything.", "And that it is going to take a different type of system", "where people can trust and collaborate,", "and then that's where I think", "the unique capability kicks in, you know,", "what we've seen is it,", "when that happens, it pulls down all the barriers,", "and the sooner that outcome comes,", "the walls come down and people come together,", "and still, that wonderful Blockchain word,", "and I finally said it at the end, [laughs] finally.", "That comes out after the fact.",
