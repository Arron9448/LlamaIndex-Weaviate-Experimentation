Obviously the rhetoric was nothing short of inciting a riot.\u201d", "As Trump\u2019s presidency winds down with a final burst of chaos and belligerence, the storming of the Capitol by supporters attempting to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory proved a step too far for some of those in America\u2019s heartland who have stuck by Trump through four turbulent years.", "Insurrection Day: when white supremacist terror came to the US Capitol Read more", "Shaffer, a farmer and river conservationist in Iowa\u2019s rural Howard county, still has lots of questions about the legitimacy of the presidential election. But the sight of a mob smashing into Congress, with what looked very much like the president\u2019s blessing, was too much.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been to the Capitol many, many times, and it\u2019s a place to revere and have respect. It\u2019d be like walking into a cathedral and screaming or throwing things. You have respect. What they did was just completely disgraceful. They\u2019re definitely not the people that I live amongst in Howard county that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.", "Over the past two years, the Guardian has spoken regularly to Trump supporters in swing counties across the midwest and returned to ask their views following the assault on the Capitol.", "Trump took Howard county in 2016 after it was twice won by Barack Obama. In November, the president increased his share of the vote as support strengthened in conservative rural areas even if it was not enough to overcome a surge against Trump in key midwestern cities that cost him the election.", "But some Trump voters have recoiled at the violence in Washington and found themselves drawing uncomfortable parallels with the rioting that on occasion accompanied Black Lives Matter protests that in some cases underpinned their support for Trump.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Neil Shaffer: \u2018What they did was just completely disgraceful.\u2019 Photograph: Jordan Gale/The Guardian", "\u201cI thought what happened was appalling, the violence,\u201d said Terri Burl, a substitute teacher and former Republican party chair in northern Wisconsin who was an early member of Women for Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not violent people. The violent people are on the left.\u201d", "But Burl struggles when asked if Trump bears responsibility because of his incendiary speech to the Save America rally immediately before the Capitol was stormed.", "\u201cThis is a real tough one because on one hand he knows that the election integrity was in question and he wanted us to go to DC, and wanted us to support him. He didn\u2019t want people to be violent. They were violent, though. Do I think his rhetoric might have caused that? Well, yeah, maybe to some of these people whose brains aren\u2019t quite the proper way.", "\u201cWhen he said, fight for me he doesn\u2019t mean use violence.

I really don\u2019t believe in my heart, that he thought there was going to be violence.\u201d", "Shaffer isn\u2019t persuaded, in part because Trump was slow to call on the insurrectionists to stop.", "One midwestern Republican who travelled to Washington by coach with other Trump supporters to demand Biden\u2019s victory be annulled \u2013 and who declined to be named for fear of arrest \u2013 said Trump had nothing to apologise for and neither did the protesters demanding that Congress \u201caudit the vote\u201d even though the president\u2019s campaign has been unable to produce credible evidence of rigging.", "\u201cThe election has been stolen, what else were people supposed to do? We went to court and the courts wouldn\u2019t even look at the evidence. We asked Mitch [McConnell, the Senate majority leader] and Republican leaders to hit pause on declaring Biden the winner and to look at the evidence, and they wouldn\u2019t. So what choice were we left with?\u201d said the activist who declined to say if they were among those who broke into the Capitol.", "\u201cSome of the people there were idiots, dressing up like they were in the jungle.

But those who say there was nothing to any of the questions about the election also bear responsibility. We should have a legitimate inquiry about how our elections are conducted and results are collected and things like that,\u201d he said.", "Still, Shaffer accepts that state and national authorities, including Republican-run administrations in states such as Georgia, as well as state and federal courts, have all endorsed the election as legitimate.", "\u201cIf there was anything that would have probably changed my mind or even changed the outcome it would have been had the supreme court seen something that would have risen to the level of judicial review,\u201d he said.", "Burl said Trump has been subject to \u201cfour years of hate\u201d and that he would have decisively won the election on his record on the economy and immigration had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A campaign sign for Donald Trump lies beneath water in the Capitol Reflecting Pool, near the west front of the US Capitol on Saturday.

It\u2019s been a long time coming. I cried on election night, and then I cried a few days ago because it\u2019s a process. I\u2019m grieving now.
