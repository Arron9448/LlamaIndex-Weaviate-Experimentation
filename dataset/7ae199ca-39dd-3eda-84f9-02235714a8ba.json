Denied access to the Bowie back catalogue, most film-makers would have given up. Danny Boyle did, ditching his \u201cwonderful\u201d biopic in 2012 after Bowie turned him down.", "Stardust finds some creative workarounds. Such as framing the story round a trip to the US where the struggling singer (a miscast Johnny Flynn) is forbidden from performing (he doesn\u2019t have the right paperwork). On the rare occasions this Bowie does sing, it is strictly cover versions (Jacques Brel, Scott Walker, the Yardbirds). He goes to a Velvet Underground gig and listens to the Stooges on the radio, but we don\u2019t hear their music, either. As a result, Stardust resembles a bizarre knock-off \u2013 like that notorious Turkish version of Star Wars from the early 80s.", "Stardust is an extreme example, but much of the art we see in movies is equally fake. While the \u201cofficial\u201d biopic bandwagon trundles along with hits such as Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocket Man, many unofficial stories go down the Stardust route. Like the Beatles movie Backbeat or the Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side, neither of which featured the artists\u2019 own music. Or, more to the point, Todd Haynes\u2019s glam rock odyssey Velvet Goldmine, which was intended to feature several Bowie tunes until, again, Bowie withdrew permission. Haynes retooled the story to make the character less Bowie-like.", "It is not just a music thing: art and other intellectual property is invariably owned by estates, whose permission must be obtained or palms greased. Even the artist who did Mike Tyson\u2019s face tattoo successfully sued the makers of The Hangover: Part II for using it. Anthony Hopkins\u2019s Surviving Picasso contained no actual Picassos. Likewise, Basquiat featured no works by Jean-Michel Basquiat; instead, director Julian Schnabel oversaw the production of some knock-offs (the movie also features a knock-off Andy Warhol, played by a certain David Bowie).", "This is also why you didn\u2019t hear Dr Martin Luther King say \u201cI have a dream\u201d in the movie Selma. The King estate had already licensed the rights to Steven Spielberg, who was planning his own MLK movie. Instead, Selma crafted its own oratory \u201cin the style of\u201d King, which was delivered so persuasively by David Oyelowo we barely registered the subterfuge.", "Does it matter? There was a storm in a teacup last year when culture secretary Oliver Dowden discovered that The Crown was \u2013 gasp! \u2013 not wholly historically accurate. The Crown is no more \u201cofficial\u201d than Stardust. It is fakery, and most of us are fine with that. Distinguishing between genuine fakery and fake fakery is splitting hairs. The only thing that matters is how well it\u2019s done."], "authors": ["Steve Rose"], "keywords": ["biopic", "king", "isnt", "velvet", "try", "movie", "fakery", "songs", "stardust", "david", "music", "ziggy", "bowie"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
