A time of wonder and anticipation. And paranoia. First comes the visit to your doctor, where you receive the (hopefully) happy news. Then comes the Talk, which goes something like: \u201cRemember to take it easy for the next nine months. Pamper yourself. Get lots of sleep. And don\u2019t eat any deli meats, or you could murder your baby.\u201d", "O.K., this might not be exactly what the doctor says, but it\u2019s what many women hear. Daily life takes on a frightening new dimension. Is there toxoplasmosis on the cat\u2019s butt? Is the hair salon full of poisonous fumes? Complicating things is the gap between the official recommendations and what people actually do. The handout says stick to \u201cone small cup\u201d of coffee and stay away from alcohol. But we all know that the coffee thing is B.S., and that it\u2019s perfectly fine to have a glass of wine, because . . . they do it in France, right? What about that trending Times article, \u201cEating Nuts During Pregnancy Tied to Brain Benefits in Baby\u201d? Or the fact that Kourtney Kardashian avoided microwaves after she had a baby?", "Navigating this gantlet, when I was pregnant, I called a friend who had recently given birth. She cut me off, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a book you need to read.\u201d The book was by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who studies health care. In her day job, she pores over medical journals and government data sets for insights into how we treat diseases such as Huntington\u2019s, diabetes, and H.I.V./AIDS. In 2010, Oster got pregnant. Confronted with the usual mixed messages\u2014her doctor told her that a glass of wine was \u201cprobably O.K.\u201d\u2014she went home, logged in to PubMed, a database of medical literature, and downloaded every study on alcohol and caffeine going back to the nineteen-eighties. She then spent several days performing a personal meta-analysis: evaluating the merits of the studies, throwing out the weak ones, and making an assessment of the risks. (Her conclusion: a glass of wine a day in the second or third trimester wasn\u2019t a problem, and she could keep drinking coffee guilt-free.)", "Oster\u2019s research expanded into her 2013 book, \u201cExpecting Better,\u201d which became a hit among pregnant women\u2014at least among the subset of pregnant women with the time and resources to devote to issues like caffeine dosage and sushi intake. In the book, Oster recounts the choices that she faced during her pregnancy and tackles such topics as prohibited foods, weight gain, and C-sections, frequently dismantling the received wisdom. Flatteringly, she addresses her reader as a peer. She doesn\u2019t issue opaque decrees, with the implicit condescension of \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m an expert.\u201d She doesn\u2019t slip into cutesy jargon, like the pun-prone authors of the latest edition of \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting,\u201d who call pregnant women \u201cMama\u201d and suggest that you \u201cstart every morning with a bump selfie.\u201d Instead, she takes the reader on a tour of the scientific literature, even describing the methodology of specific studies to show how she made each decision. Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the pregnancy and parenting Web site the Bump, explained Oster\u2019s appeal to me in an e-mail: \u201cThe whole tone of the book is very pro-Mom, putting the power back in the hands of the pregnant woman. I read it when I was pregnant with my first child, and it left me feeling empowered to ask my OB why or why not. It also reminded me that I was part of the equation, too.\u201d", "Despite the plaudits, the book didn\u2019t go over well with many public-health officials, who disagreed especially vehemently with Oster\u2019s conclusions about alcohol. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, on Boston\u2019s NPR station, that Oster\u2019s advice was wrong: \u201cWe need to err on the side of caution, and the side of caution says that we have not been able to identify any amount of alcohol that is absolutely safe in pregnancy.\u201d But Oster\u2019s fans were undeterred. Amy Schumer called Oster \u201cthe non-judgmental girlfriend holding our hand and guiding us through pregnancy and motherhood.\u201d", "Last month, Oster published a sequel, \u201cCribsheet,\u201d subtitled \u201cA Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool.\u201d It takes on subjects like cold season, nap schedules, and potty training. As the mother of a sixteen-month-old, I had a host of burning questions: Will she ever willingly wear clothes? Is it wrong to buy those little kids\u2019 leashes? Why does she put her finger in other babies\u2019 mouths and say, \u201cBite\u201d?", "Parenting experts have been around for as long as there have been anxious parents. They have channelled the fears and the aspirations of their times. Eighteenth-century parents adopted Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s ideas about \u201cnatural\u201d parenting\u2014cold air is good for a child!\u2014even though he\u2019d left all five of his children at a foundling hospital. Dr. Spock, who had trained in psychoanalysis, gave parenting advice a Freudian spin, and his mantra\u2014\u201cTrust yourself. You know more than you think you do\u201d\u2014soothed addled Cold War parents.", "It makes sense that our parenting expert du jour is a data wonk. In some ways, data are to today\u2019s parents what psychoanalysis was to the postwar generation: a hoped-for savior. We try to make sense of a chaotic world by reading Nate Silver\u2019s political forecasts and wearing devices that count our steps. At the same time, Big Data is increasingly sinister. If you\u2019ve been pregnant lately, you\u2019ve undoubtedly had the eerie experience of seeing baby-related ads popping up online before you\u2019ve shared the news with anyone. The information age has turned out to be a breeding ground for misinformation, with \u201cMoneyball\u201d giving way to Twitter bots, viral pseudoscience, and dubious Facebook news feeds.", "Oster is here to help you navigate this glut. As a pop-economist, she follows in the tradition of Steven Levitt, of \u201cFreakonomics\u201d fame. Levitt, who has six children, including two who are younger than three, told me that Oster\u2019s first book \u201cis the bible of my circle.\u201d At a time when pregnancy and child rearing have become polarized and moralized\u2014natural births, water births, orgasmic births?\u2014it can be refreshing to hear from someone who sticks to the numbers. \u201cEconomists focus on how the world is,\u201d Levitt told me. \u201cA lot of parenting advice is focussed on how the world should be in someone\u2019s mind.\u201d", "What did I want from Oster\u2019s books? Until recently, most of life\u2019s outcomes seemed within my control. If I exercised, I could get in shape. (Not that I ever did.) If I worked hard at school, and then at my job, I could earn good grades and promotions. But becoming a parent was different. No matter how many pregnancy apps I downloaded, I couldn\u2019t control when I would get pregnant, or if it would go well. And, after the baby arrived, I seemed to be stuck in crisis mode. The data seemed like a way to get back, if not power, then at least a sense of mastery.", "Oster now has two children, Penelope and Finn, who are eight and four. She spends most of her days in her office at Brown, where she is currently researching methodological problems with data on health trends (vitamins, superfoods). Given the subject matter of her books, I thought it best to see her in the domestic sphere. I arrived at her home, in Providence, Rhode Island, at 6:30 a.m. It was still dark outside. Oster was standing at her kitchen counter in working-mom attire: a black business skirt and stockings, with a zip-up hoodie over her blouse to protect it from grubby hands. The place was neat but minimally furnished\u2014an indication, to me, that she wasn\u2019t especially interested in interior decorating. But I knew from her books that she likes to sew, and there were two plates of attractive muffins on the counter. She\u2019d gotten up at 5 a.m. to bake.", "Oster has striking blue eyes and short, straight brown hair. In person, as in her writing, she combines extreme practicality with a dry sense of humor. In a chapter in \u201cCribsheet\u201d about staying at home versus working, she writes that, while she loves her children, \u201cthe marginal value of time with my kids declines fast.\u201d In a section on milk oversupply during breast-feeding, she mentions gua-sha therapy, a skin-scraping treatment, and adds, \u201cGwyneth Paltrow swears by this, so take what you will from that.\u201d", "From the books, I also knew a good deal about Oster\u2019s family. Her husband, Jesse Shapiro, is an economist at Brown as well, known for his work on political polarization, and her parents are both economists at Yale. As a child in the nineteen-eighties, Oster said, \u201cwe were the only people who ordered groceries from the grocery store.\u201d When young Emily asked her mother, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ever go to the store, like regular people?,\u201d her mother told her, \u201cBecause my time is very valuable. I have a high opportunity cost.\u201d Naturally, Oster recalled, \u201cI was, like, Oh, O.K. That makes sense.\u201d"], "authors": ["Lizzie Widdicombe", "Lizzie Widdicomb", "Amy Davidson Sorki", "Adam Gopni"], "keywords": ["book", "parenting", "data", "parents", "sense", "pregnant", "numbers", "osters", "pregnancy", "told", "oster"], "pubDate": "2019-06-03T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
