Today we visit Keukenhof, the heart of the glorious Dutch bulbfields. On arrival, nothing prepares you for the dazzling spectrum of colours stretched out before you in the world\u2019s largest flower garden, covering nearly 80 acres. The art of flower planting reaches breathtaking heights at Keukenhof, a gardener\u2019s heaven created by more than seven million tulips, daffodils and other blooms set among a beautiful landscape of shimmering lakes, ancient trees, flowering shrubs and water gardens. We re-join our ship in Amsterdam and after lunch you\u2019re free to explore as you wish. Amsterdam is an art-lover\u2019s dream. The Rijksmuseum is an architectural marvel itself, but it holds a magnificent collection of works by Dutch masters such as Rembrandt and Vermeer, while admirers of Post-Impressionism might prefer the Van Gogh Museum, housing the world\u2019s greatest collection of works by this genius of a man. Or relax in a pavement caf\u00e9, absorbing Amsterdam\u2019s special atmosphere over a rich Dutch coffee, browse the many shops or perhaps just stay on board to catch up on some reading. Tonight there\u2019s another culinary highlight \u2013 the Captain\u2019s Dinner, when the chef prepares his superb \u2018signature\u2019 dishes for you to enjoy in the splendid surroundings of the ship\u2019s restaurant, with a chance to reflect on the fascinating places you have discovered, poignant stories you have heard and the new friends you have made."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["flanders", "prepares", "oscar", "flower", "bulbfields", "ship", "wilde", "river", "medieval", "cruise", "works", "collection", "ms", "keukenhof", "bruges", "amsterdam", "dutch", "youre", "worlds"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
