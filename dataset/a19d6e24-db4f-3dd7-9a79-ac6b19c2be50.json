Its fortunes are closely linked with the vagaries of the country\u2019s stockmarket. A crash can mean the sack or worse for the man in charge. Xiao Gang, who headed the China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) during the spectacular boom and bust of 2015, was fired and has become an object of scorn among investors. Liu Shiyu, who took over from Mr Xiao and saw China rank among the world\u2019s worst-performing markets in 2018, later faced corruption charges (which might have been overlooked had the market done better). As China\u2019s CSI 300 index of blue-chip stocks tumbled by 14% in late February and early March this year, attention turned to their successor, Yi Huiman.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Between then and early February this year the CSI 300 rose by more than 90%, and reached a 14-year high on February 10th. The unexpected correction that kicked off on February 22nd was the sharpest in years and revived fears of a collapse similar to those in 2007 and 2015. Many of China\u2019s largest stocks, such as Kweichow Moutai, a liquor-maker, shed a quarter of their market value.", "Striking a balance between exuberance and rout is no simple task for technocrats in Beijing. The stockmarket is dominated by retail investors who are highly sensitive to political suggestions on the direction of trading. The practice of pledging shares as collateral to brokers also leads to sudden drops in share prices when margin calls go unmet and collateral is liquidated. Mr Xiao ignored growing leverage and trumpeted exuberance. As the crash began in June 2015 he indicated the rally would go on. Instead the CSI 300 fell by nearly 40% in a matter of months. Mr Liu fared no better. In 2017 he waged an attack on market manipulators, whom he called \u201cgiant alligators\u201d. The crackdown, along with poor economic sentiment, sapped risk appetite."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["stockmarket", "yi", "regulators", "doing", "300", "2015", "chinas", "stocks", "mr", "xiao", "corrects", "try", "market", "csi", "took"], "pubDate": "2021-04-08T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
