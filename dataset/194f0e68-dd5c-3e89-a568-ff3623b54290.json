Just ask them about onions. This autumn the humble bulb has challenged titans.", "The trouble began when unseasonably heavy rains followed drought across the onion-growing belt of north and central India. That not only all but destroyed the crop; the wet caused more than a third of onions in storage to rot. The result is a severe shortage of onions across India, as a result of which prices more than tripled.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "This hardly threatens famine\u2014something the green revolution abolished decades ago by boosting wheat and rice yields. Yet remove the onion and you struggle to imagine Indian cuisine. It forms the base for curries and biryanis. When a poor Indian has nothing else to eat, at least she has an onion with a chapati or two.", "The onion crisis has hit both the farmers and urban consumers of north India, the political heartland of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ). In the past, state and even national governments have fallen over onions: Indira Gandhi\u2019s return to power in 1980 was assisted by an election campaign that equated high onion prices with economic mismanagement. Mr Modi, who faces growing economic problems, is surely aware of the perils. In late September his government slapped a ban on exports of onions. That briefly brought down prices, helping consumers. But it has angered farmers and exporters in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, for whom onions are an essential cash crop. For the BJP these are key battleground states. And when onion prices are high another problem emerges\u2014organised gangs of allium thieves. The government risks getting blamed for those too.", "In South Asia, a region riven by geopolitical faultlines, there are international implications. Upon hearing of Mr Modi\u2019s export ban, Bangladesh\u2019s strongwoman, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, admonished his government for giving no warning. Her country counts on Indian onions, whose price at one point had risen fivefold in the markets of Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital. She had, she claimed, been forced to tell her own chef to cook without onions, no small or easy thing.", "Bangladesh immediately tendered for imports to be airlifted from Egypt, Turkey and, notably, from Pakistan. Trade between the two countries has been negligible since Bangladesh split from Pakistan in a terrible war in 1971. Relations have been especially strained over the recent convictions and executions for war crimes of pro-Pakistan Bangladeshis. So the approach to Pakistan hinted at the government\u2019s desperation.", "Despite a long, shared land border, trade between Pakistan and India is also lamentably small. The two countries too often relish their political enmity over the huge potential benefits from trade. However, such is India\u2019s onion crisis, it, too, is turning to Pakistan.", "Though such decisions are taken at the highest level, it is too much to think that this welcome outbreak of onion diplomacy can lay South Asia\u2019s old antagonisms to rest. Even at home, Indian politicians are blind to some obvious conclusions from the crisis, however much their fate is tied to the markets for farm produce. Though the BJP reacts quickly to market stress, politicians have done far too little to encourage decent agricultural warehousing. A consequence is that staggering proportions of vegetables and fruit (and even pulses and grain) end up spoiled. The impediments to trade and poor storage mean that even modest changes in supply and demand lead to wild swings in prices. An onion glut last year, for instance, prompted calls for aid for farmers."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "Food is a fulcrum in Indian politics", "pubDate": null, "summary": "The result is a severe shortage of onions across India, as a result of which prices more than tripled.\nWhen a poor Indian has nothing else to eat, at least she has an onion with a chapati or two.\nAnd when onion prices are high another problem emerges\u2014organised gangs of allium thieves.\nHer country counts on Indian onions, whose price at one point had risen fivefold in the markets of Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital.\nHowever, such is India\u2019s onion crisis, it, too, is turning to Pakistan.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/12/07/food-is-a-fulcrum-in-indian-politics"}
