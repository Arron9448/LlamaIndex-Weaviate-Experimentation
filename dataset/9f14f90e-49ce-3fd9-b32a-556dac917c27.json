Fed up with apps, ghosting and rushed drinks with strangers after work, she complained to her friend Lina about the situation.", "Unbeknown to her, Lina had been in touch with another friend, Ryan Lacey, who was based in Germany for his US army job, and also struggling to meet someone. \u201cShe connected us on Instagram and suggested that we chat,\u201d says Nelly. \u201cShe thought we\u2019d be really good together.\u201d", "The pair hit it off but, as they lived 4,000 miles apart, the conversation soon fizzled out. \u201cWe started chatting again when I was on a two-week trip in South America last February,\u201d says Nelly. \u201cBy the time I got back to New York, the pandemic was taking hold, so I went back to my home town in rural Arizona to stay with my parents.\u201d", "During lockdown, she and Ryan continued to talk on Instagram, before switching to FaceTime. Ryan says the slower pace of life meant they were able to invest more time getting to know each other. \u201cNormally when you\u2019re dating, you have so much else going on in your life you\u2019re not able to concentrate on the person as much. I was able to get to know Nelly with nothing else in the way.\u201d", "Nelly says living at home meant she wasn\u2019t distracted by the \u201cartificiality\u201d of her New York life. The pair watched TV shows and took walks \u201ctogether\u201d on their video dates, and she was able to show him to some of her favourite childhood haunts.", "As soon as travel restrictions were lifted, they made plans to meet in his home city of Boston. \u201cIt was the end of June, and we had to balance social responsibility with meeting up. We invested in good-quality masks and rented an apartment that nobody had been in since February. We were really careful,\u201d he says. Ryan was \u201csuper-nervous\u201d but \u201cimmediately felt at ease\u201d when he saw Nelly. After the trip, he went back to Germany to quarantine, feeling disappointed that they might not be able to meet again soon.", "During the trip, they had made jokes about getting married, so they could continue to see each other. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before our marriage joke started to become a reality. There was no travel from the US into Germany at the time, and we didn\u2019t see another option for being together,\u201d says Nelly. \u201cIt sounds crazy, but it didn\u2019t feel like a crazy thing.\u201d They discovered that US military personnel were able to marry by proxy in the state of Montana with neither party physically present. Though neither of them had ever been to the state, proxies were sent to the courthouse, and they were legally married. They were emailed copies of the marriage certificate a week later, but haven\u2019t celebrated yet.", "\u201cEverything\u2019s on hold until we can get our families together again safely,\u201d says Ryan. When they married, his parents were \u201cshocked\u201d but supportive. \u201cThey\u2019d met her briefly in Boston and my brother had picked us up from the airport. Now my mum wants to talk to Nelly all the time and send her gifts.\u201d", "She\u2019s creative and emotional, whereas I am very logical. We work really well together", "Because she\u2019d been living with her parents as their relationship developed, Nelly says her family were less surprised. \u201cIt took them a while to get used to the idea, but they had watched the relationship grow.\u201d In September, Nelly flew to Germany to be with her partner in Kaiserslautern in the south-west of the country, and now works remotely for Columbia Business School.", "\u201cWe had to make adjustments when Nelly moved here as we\u2019d never lived together before,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been able to talk and communicate really well.\u201d They agree that in many ways the lockdown made them stronger. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because I guess everyone has had a bad year, but I have had an amazing year because I met her.\u201d The couple love to travel and are making plans to explore Europe after the lockdown lifts. In the meantime, they are happy spending time with each other at home. \u201cNelly is so beautiful, and her personality really complements mine,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cShe\u2019s creative and emotional, whereas I am very logical. We work really well together.\u201d Nelly loves her partner\u2019s consistency. \u201cHe shows his love through actions and follows through on everything he says he will. We\u2019re really lucky.\u201d", "Want to share your story?
