(Its second season came out on Friday.) It centers on Otis (Asa Butterfield), a mild-mannered teen who, despite being a virgin in a dorky windbreaker, in the first season becomes a sex therapist to his high-school peers. He\u2019s got hangups\u2014he won\u2019t even masturbate\u2014but, all around him, the world is bursting with vitality and lust, and, because his divorced parents are both sex therapists, he\u2019s got the concepts down. A savvy classmate, Maeve (Emma Mackey), notices his talent for giving advice, and the plot unfurls from there. \u201cSex Education\u201d has fun with its concept and characters while respecting them: we get to know people through their intimate vulnerabilities, alongside diagrams of genitalia and phrases like \u201cscrotal anxiety.\u201d As they manage their clinic and their lives, Otis and Maeve fall in love, but not at the same time. The writing and performances (many by relatively unknown young actors) are so sharp that, by the end of the first season, the status of each relationship felt like a cliffhanger.", "Nunn created \u201cSex Education\u201d in part because sex wasn\u2019t discussed in her schools growing up. Dramatically and comedically, she was inspired by John Hughes movies, \u201cFreaks and Geeks,\u201d and \u201cMean Girls.\u201d The result often feels like a successor to them, and a welcome update\u2014the best of earlier teen dramedy through a more enlightened, feminist lens, centering pleasure and mutual respect, critical of slut-shaming, lacking the racism of a Long Duk Dong character or the hissing class warfare of John Hughes\u2019s wounded psyche. These teens don\u2019t balk at saying \u201cvagina\u201d or \u201cperiod\u201d; L.G.B.T.Q. characters are respected and reasonably happy; sex is understood to be healthy and normal, and to be managed responsibly, not repressed.", "The world of \u201cSex Education\u201d isn\u2019t like teen fare we\u2019ve seen before\u2014but neither is it stylistically arch. The setting is quietly wondrous, and green as a terrarium: Otis and his mom, Jean (Gillian Anderson), live on a lushly verdant riverside bluff in a Victorian house, like Villa Villekula with a view. (Its d\u00e9cor includes phallic plants and erotic art: \u201cWhy is there a minge on your wall?\u201d a classmate asks.) Otis and his ebullient best friend, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), bike to school through gorgeous primeval woods; school outcasts take refuge, and get their sex advice, in an abandoned restroom overgrown with ivy. The heightened visual world is both sui generis and generalized, the town unpinpointed on a map. That mix of specificity and freedom corresponds to the show\u2019s narrative style. There\u2019s no explanatory voice-over or title cards or fake-documentary fourth-wall breaking, which helps liberate us from the overfamiliarity of high-school tropes. Music cues are on the nose, corresponding lyrically to what\u2019s happening in the moment (\u201cI Touch Myself,\u201d \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d), but, because they\u2019re eighties-flavored or generations-spanning (Ezra Furman covers of LCD Soundsystem, say) they don\u2019t feel overdetermined.", "In the first season, the near-rainforest level of foliage suggested an Edenic wilderness of innocence and possibility; in the second, knowledge has crept in, with serpentine results. Vitality has made its way into Otis\u2019s life, and into his pants. He now has a girlfriend, Ola (Patricia Allison), but he\u2019s hesitant with her, and he can\u2019t stop masturbating: his days are a never-ending loop of pants tents, room-fleeing, wanking, and showers. (Some of this is shown with empathy and hilarity; some veers uncomfortably close to \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d slapstick.) Eric, winning as ever, both delights in Otis\u2019s new situation\u2014\u201cYou have discovered the wonder of your own penis, my friend!\u201d\u2014and howls with laughter at his boner problems. Meanwhile, at school, the term begins with a chlamydia panic. (Cue \u201cWe Don\u2019t Have to Take Our Clothes Off,\u201d performed by the glee club.) Emergency assemblies are called; face masks are donned. Otis\u2019s wisdom is more needed than ever. \u201cYou cannot catch an S.T.I. from a pitch whistle!\u201d he exclaims at one point.", "But, though it\u2019s mostly a delight, Season 2, which is hard not to binge all at once, at times makes for painful viewing. This is largely because Otis\u2014now challenged to face the realities of love, intimacy, and sex in his own life\u2014sometimes acts like an asshole. Butterfield, twenty-two, is an appealing actor who brings empathy to his awkwardly endearing character; perhaps it\u2019s the soundtrack, but I can\u2019t help seeing something Andrew McCarthy-ish in his eyes. His performance in the first season was so feeling and mature that it managed to convince us that a sixteen-year-old boy could make a viable sex therapist. Watching Otis dispense soulful advice to hapless, confused peers\u2014\u201cIf you don\u2019t like yourself, how are you supposed to believe that Sam does?\u201d\u2014was a marvel, as was watching Otis and Maeve recognize each other\u2019s subtle uniqueness. (\u201cYou saw something in me when no one else did,\u201d he tells her.) In Season 2, his masturbatory misadventures aren\u2019t his only problem: his emotions are all over the place, and he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. He, and other characters we\u2019ve grown to love, hurt one another, and we hurt, too\u2014and it\u2019s not always clear to me whether these pains are the fault of the characters or of the writing.", "Movies and shows about teen life\u2014like teens themselves\u2014sometimes try to stand out by trying too hard, by being showy, or self-aware. We trust \u201cSex Education\u201d not to do that, not to go for the predictable horror, not to be too cruel, broad, upsetting, or clich\u00e9d. When it approaches that territory, it seems to violate its pact of trust with the viewer\u2014it\u2019s special, and we want it to be perfect. For the most part, the storytelling in Season 2 continues to be masterly\u2014plot arising from character and observation, almost all of it tremendously satisfying. But as Otis\u2019s behavior deviates farther and farther from what he might advise others to do, culminating in an excruciating scene of drunken public jerkiness, I found myself wishing that the writers had made different choices, my suspension of disbelief pierced. Other elements help compensate: Gatwa, as Eric, is a particular standout, with storylines that thrill; Lily (Tanya Reynolds), the lovably horny sci-fi geek, spearheads a delirious Shakespeare musical; and Adam (Connor Swindells), the bully and screwup trying to find his way, will break your heart. They, and everybody else, journey, with difficulty, toward employing the tools that Jean, Otis\u2019s mom, articulates in the season\u2019s first episode: \u201cThe three Ts: trust, talking, and truth.\u201d The three Ts are her suggested cure for the school\u2019s chlamydia panic\u2014but, as \u201cSex Education\u201d teaches us and its characters, as goes the bedroom, so goes life."], "authors": ["Sarah Larson", "Luke Mogelson", "Jia Tolentino", "Alex Ross", "Erik Agard", "Elizabeth Flock", "Naomi Fry"], "keywords": ["doctor", "otiss", "education", "world", "dont", "trust", "sex", "otis", "season", "characters", "teen"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
