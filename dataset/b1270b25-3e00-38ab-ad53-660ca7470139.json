Ultimate revealed that Byleth from Fire Emblem: Three Houses is joining the ever-growing, enormous roster of fighters.", "Available in both male and female forms, Byleth is the eighth character from the Fire Emblem series in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Byleth isn't great at throws or mobility, but they have great distance and varied attacks thanks to a changing weapon depending on the direction of your attack. Byleth also has some seriously powerful attacks, but you have to be careful, as some of them are easily countered by other Fire Emblem characters. Byleth's alternate costumes are based on the house leaders, Sothis, and something that happens later in the game.", "Along with Byleth comes Garreg Mach Monastery, which is full of guest characters from Fire Emblem: Three Houses and different locales. Near the marketplace, you'll find characters from the Blue Lion House, while the Reception Hall features Black Eagle characters. As you continue flying around thanks to the standard Super Smash Bros. platform, the Bridge is a wide area with Golden Deer guests in the background. The Cathedral is the final area of Garreg Mach Monastery with Seteth, Rhea, and Flayn watching in the background.", "This DLC pack also adds 11 new songs, all of which are available to use in all Fire Emblem stages. The Spirit Board also gains popular characters and the House Leaders, as well as a new \"A Heroic Legacy\" path in Classic Mode, which lets you battle through Fire Emblem-based battles.", "Additionally, the pack adds new Mii Fighter costumes including Altair from Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft's Rabbids, a couple of Mega Man costumes, and even a Cuphead costume. If you purchase the Cuphead costume, you even get a song from the game to add to your music collection in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The costumes are available for $0.75 each.", "Byleth and their stage join Smash Ultimate on January 28 as a part of Challenger Pack 5 for $5.99 or as the fifth and final character of the first Fighters Pass.
