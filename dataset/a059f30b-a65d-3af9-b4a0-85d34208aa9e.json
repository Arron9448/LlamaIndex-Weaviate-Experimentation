But, as Diez notes, \u201cit\u2019s very complex to explain what is \u2018artisanal\u2019 in concrete terms.\u201d Thus, Diez and her husband, Adri\u00e1n Pellejo, are working to bring together a selection of excellent cheeses that buyers can be sure champion ethical practices, taking into consideration all elements that go into making it artisanal: the livestock feeding methods, the handling and care in the production processes, and the commitment to generate a positive impact on the environment.", "Before she launched Formaje, Diez worked for five years as an export director for the artisan cheese shop Queseria Cultivo. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of cheese as a link, a link that connects people, territories, cultures\u2026 and all this information gets transferred to you through flavor or through taste, which is an amazing way of communication,\u201d she muses. When shopping artisanally, ideally we are plunged deeper into a culture, a practice, a ritual. By creating a space that fosters discussion with every purchase, Diez hopes artisanal cheese simply becomes the norm.", "Clara Diez poses with Formaje\u2019s bag, made in collaboration with designer Emily Levine Photo: Courtesy of Formaje", "Considering artisanal cheese as a means for connection, Diez intends for Formaje to ultimately encourage an open dialogue around food production and sustainability. \u201cI want cheese to go hand-in-hand with art, fashion and technology,\u201d she says. \u201cFinding uncharted ways to introduce the cheese culture into new universes allows us to amplify our message,\u201d she adds. In her first collaboration with designer Emily Levine, the pair created a limited edition piece inspired by the traditional use of muslin fabric used to wrap cheese during ripening. Using one of Levine\u2019s staple designs, the knotted bag, the two were able to combine their universes of sustainability and craftsmanship. More collaborations like this, Diez divulges, are on the horizon in 2021.", "Formaje, in a sense, has become more than what it initially set out to be. It echoes a larger message about the power of storytelling, connection and intention. If we can be intentional about how we shop for clothes and beauty, or how we create brands, we can be intentional about other habitual practices in our day-to-day life\u2014like, say, eating cheese."], "authors": ["Monica Mendal", "Monica Menda", "Tamar Adler", "Lovia Gyarkye", "Mosha Lundstr\u00f6m Halbert"], "keywords": ["clara", "practices", "diez", "wants", "small", "artisanal", "sustainability", "care", "message", "future", "formajes", "shop", "production", "universes", "cheese"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
