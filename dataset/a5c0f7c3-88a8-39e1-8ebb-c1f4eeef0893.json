Over the last decade or so, we have witnessed a slow and sometimes painful pivot as fashion at first ignored, then loftily entertained, and finally fell head-over-heels for the concept of \u201csustainability.\u201d Those who were once dismissed as sackcloth-wearing, soy-munching, Gaia-loving outliers\u2014ideology driven pioneers such as before-her-time Katharine Hamnett, perfectly-timed Stella McCartney, and of-his-time Christopher Raeburn\u2014have proven to be the Cassandras who saw first what most of fashion was too busy making new stuff to realize: As a marker of desirability, being environmentally virtuous has transitioned from niche consideration to central parameter of desire.", "To succeed commercially, fashion must reflect and service the desires of its times. Which is why at a time when it has dawned on many of us that the Paris Agreement (on climate change) is far more significant than Paris Fashion Week, we\u2019ve seen a welcome rush of CSR sustainability statements from larger houses and an increasing amount of new labels whose message is built around their environmental credentials. This emphasis on \u201csustainability,\u201d however, increasingly feels like a sop\u2014a Band-Aid on a bullet-wound\u2014and leads to what I like to term \u201cThe Westwood Paradox.\u201d", "Along with Hamnett, Vivienne Westwood was one of the earliest converts to environmentally conscious fashion design. Every season she continues to bang that drum with vigor, and delivers an encyclopedic digest of her sustainably sourced materials alongside the collections they are cut in. And yet to sell items emblazoned with \u201cI \u2665 CRAP\u201d\u2014disguising thoughtless fashion consumption as a knowing critique of thoughtless fashion consumption\u2014points to the contradiction at the heart of fashion\u2019s articulation of \u201csustainability.\u201d Even the notion of \u201csustainability\u201d itself is suspicious in its looseness. As Christopher Raeburn has said, \u201cThe definition of sustainability is enduring at the same pace.
