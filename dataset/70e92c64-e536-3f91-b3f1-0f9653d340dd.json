President Biden hopes the new targets convince other nations to do more to combat global warming. Credit... Brian Snyder/Reuters President Biden will announce Thursday that the United States intends to cut planet-warming emissions nearly in half by the end of the decade, a target that would require Americans to transform the way they drive, heat their homes and manufacture goods. The target, confirmed by three people briefed on the plan, is timed to a closely watched global summit meeting that Mr. Biden is hosting Thursday and Friday, which is aimed at sending a message that the United States is rejoining international efforts to fight global warming after four years of climate denial from the Trump administration. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the U.S. target, which was first reported by The Washington Post. The leaders of China, India and nearly 40 other countries are expected to join Mr. Biden virtually, and the United States hopes that the announcement of its new emissions goal will galvanize other nations to step up their own targets by the time nations gather again under United Nations auspices in November in Glasgow. The new American goal nearly doubles the pledge that the Obama administration made to cut emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, although the country would have five more years to achieve it, according to the people familiar with the target who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The 2030 target will be a range that will aim to cut emissions around 50 percent from 2005 levels. It will not include detailed modeling showing how the United States proposes to meet its pledge, one administration official said. The goal is largely in line with what environmental groups and big businesses, including McDonalds, Target and Google, have wanted. They and others argued that cutting emissions at least 50 percent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade is the only way to put the United States on a path to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by the middle of the century. On Tuesday, Gina McCarthy, Mr. Biden\u2019s top climate change adviser, hinted that the United States would set that ambitious goal. \u201cI would argue that there\u2019s opportunities for us to be able to be very aggressive, and we\u2019re going to take that opportunity,\u201d she said in an interview with N.P.R. Meeting it, however, will be a steep challenge. Nathan Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, and other energy experts described the 50 percent goal as attainable, but only with what Mr. Hultman described as \u201cpretty significant action across all sectors of the American economy.\u201d Lisa Friedman and", "The House will vote on legislation to limit the president\u2019s ability to impose travel bans. People protested President Donald J. Trump\u2019s travel ban outside the White House in 2017. New legislation would curb a president\u2019s ability to enact similar orders. Credit... Al Drago/The New York Times The Democratic-led House is set on Wednesday to pass legislation that aims to prevent the White House from instituting expansive travel bans like the one former President Donald J. Trump imposed on predominantly Muslim countries, and would explicitly bar any such edict based on religion. The No Ban Act would restrict the president\u2019s wide-ranging power to control immigration by requiring that travel bans be temporary and subject to congressional oversight, among other limitations. It would prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion. The House is also expected to approve a related measure that would require that certain immigrants be allowed access to a lawyer when they are detained at ports of entry. Republicans are expected to oppose both bills, arguing that controls should be tightened, not relaxed, given the crush of migration through the southwest border. Their objections mean the legislation is likely to have a difficult path in the Senate, joining a backlog of House-passed bills on immigration and other topics that face steep obstacles. The measures were inspired by the harsh and abrupt steps Mr. Trump took at the start of his presidency to clamp down on the entry of foreigners into the country, which led to chaos at U.S. airports and a rush of legal challenges. In January 2017, he denied entry to citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. Amid court challenges, Mr. Trump later amended the ban, expanding it to include some non-Muslim majority countries, such as North Korea. \u201cThose bans were a stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths,\u201d White House officials said in a formal statement of support for the bill issued this week. President Biden, who reversed Mr. Trump\u2019s travel bans after taking office, is backing the legislation. But in the statement, his advisers said that the administration reserves the right to restrict travel from specific countries in the future if necessary. \u201cThe administration stands ready to work with the Congress to adopt a solution that protects against unfair religious discrimination while also ensuring the executive branch has the flexibility necessary to respond to serious threats to security and public health, and emergent international crises,\u201d the statement said. Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said she could never forget the hardship inflicted on travelers by Mr. Trump\u2019s bans, which she called \u201cillegal and ill-conceived,\u201d and discriminatory against Muslims. \u201cFamilies were separated,\u201d she said. \u201cMany were denied the right to counsel.\u201d Still, the legislation comes at a fraught political moment for Mr. Biden and Democrats on immigration. In March, border agents encountered nearly 19,000 children at the border \u2014 the largest number recorded in a single month \u2014 most of them fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. And the flow of migrant children is expected to only increase in the coming weeks. Representative Guy Reschenthaler, Republican of Pennsylvania, on Tuesday argued the No Ban Act would weaken national security, and that the legislation\u2019s requirement that travelers have access to counsel \u201ccomplicates the job of Border Patrol agents\u201d and would cost millions of dollars. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cost $825 million to implement over five years. \u201cThis bill does nothing to address the Biden border crisis,\u201d he said, using the label Republicans have adopted for a situation that also existed under Mr. Trump.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Putin warns the West not to cross a red line in his annual address to Parliament.

But while Mr. Putin\u2019s annual address to Parliament on Wednesday was replete with threats against the West, it stopped short of announcing new military or foreign policy moves. Russia\u2019s response will be \u201casymmetric, fast and tough\u201d if it is forced to defend its interests, Mr. Putin said, pointing to what he asserted were Western efforts at regime change in neighboring Belarus as another threat to Russia\u2019s security. \u201cThe organizers of any provocations threatening the fundamental interests of our security will regret their deeds more than they have regretted anything in a long time,\u201d Mr. Putin told a hall of governors and members of Parliament. \u201cI hope no one gets the idea to cross the so-called red line with Russia \u2014 and we will be the ones to decide where it runs in every concrete case.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s speech had been widely anticipated, with about 100,000 Russian troops gathered on Ukraine\u2019s border and Ukraine\u2019s president warning openly of the possibility of war. Some analysts had speculated that Mr. Putin might use his annual state of the nation address to announce a pretext for sending troops into Ukraine. But that scenario did not come to pass. Mr. Putin also made no reference to the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, whose supporters planned to hold protests across the country on Wednesday. Instead, Mr. Putin spent most of his speech on domestic issues, acknowledging Russians\u2019 discontent with the hardships of the pandemic. The United States last week announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia, blaming it for a major hacking operation. Mr. Biden also called for a summit meeting with Mr. Putin, which to many Russians looked like a crude American attempt to negotiate from a position of strength. \u201cThis is seen as an unacceptable situation \u2014 you won\u2019t chase us into the stall with sanctions,\u201d said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank.", "Attorney General Merrick Garland announces an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. Activists marched outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis on Tuesday after the jury found Derek Chauvin guilty on all three charges he faced. Credit... Joshua Rashaad McFadden for The New York Times The Justice Department will investigate the policies and operations of the Minneapolis Police Department, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland announced on Wednesday, a day after the former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in the death of George Floyd in a rare rebuke of police violence. \u201cThe Justice Department has opened a civil investigation to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing,\u201d Mr. Garland said in brief remarks at the Justice Department. Such investigations are often the precursors to court-approved deals between the Justice Department and local governments that create and enforce a road map for training and operational changes. Mr. Garland\u2019s announcement came a day after the conviction of Mr. Chauvin, who was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department last year after gruesome video of him kneeling on Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes sparked protests across the nation. The inquiry into the department is separate from the existing Justice Department investigation into whether Mr. Chauvin violated Mr. Floyd\u2019s civil rights. It will be led by lawyers and staff in the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Minnesota. Investigators will seek to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including during protests; whether it engages in discriminatory conduct; and whether its treatment of those with behavioral health disabilities is unlawful. They will also review the department's policies, training, supervision and use-of-force investigations, and whether its current systems of accountability are effective at ensuring that police officers act lawfully. If the investigators find that the police department has engaged in unlawful policing, Mr. Garland said the Justice Department would issue a public report. It also has the option to bring a civil suit against the department and enter into a settlement agreement, or consent decree, to ensure that prompt and effective action is taken bring the department\u2019s practices into compliance with the law. On Friday, Mr. Garland restored the robust use of consent decrees, rescinding a Trump administration policy that largely curbed their use. The Obama administration had repeatedly used the tool to address police misconduct. The restoration of consent decrees was one of the Biden administration\u2019s first significant moves to hold police forces accountable in cases where they are found to have violated federal laws. \u201cMost of our nation\u2019s law enforcement officers do their difficult jobs honorably and lawfully. I strongly believe that good officers do not want to work in systems that allow bad practices,\u201d Mr. Garland said. The challenges that the nation faces in addressing systemic racial inequities \u201care deeply woven into our history,\u201d Mr. Garland said, adding that it would take time and effort by all to build \u201ctrust between community and law enforcement.\u201d", "\u2018It was a murder in full light of day,\u2019 President Biden says of George Floyd\u2019s death.

Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden praised a guilty verdict in the murder trial of the former police officer Derek Chauvin, but called it a \u201ctoo rare\u201d step to deliver \u201cbasic accountability\u201d for Black Americans who have been killed during interactions with the police. \u201cIt was a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the death of George Floyd, who died after Mr. Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, and whose death ignited nationwide protests. \u201cFor so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver just basic accountability.\u201d Mr. Biden delivered his remarks to the nation hours after taking the unusual step of weighing in on the trial\u2019s outcome before the jury had come back with a decision, and telling reporters that he had been \u201cpraying\u201d for the \u201cright verdict.\u201d \u201cThis can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America,\u201d Mr. Biden said during his address. Mr. Biden assumed the presidency during a national reckoning over race and has staked his political legacy around a promise to make racial equality, which includes an overhaul on policing, a central focus of his presidency. He has been outspoken about Mr. Floyd\u2019s death, calling it a \u201cwake up call\u201d for the nation. In the wake of a series of recent police-involved shootings and other violent episodes that have taken place over the course of the trial, he has repeatedly called for Congress to pass an ambitious bill on policing reform, named for Mr. Floyd and co-authored by the vice president. On Tuesday afternoon, the White House canceled an earlier speech Mr. Biden had planned to deliver on his infrastructure plan so that he could watch the verdict come in alongside Kamala Harris, the vice president, and a group of other aides in his private dining room just off the Oval Office. The jury\u2019s deliberations had been closely tracked throughout the day: In the minutes before the verdict was delivered, White House aides were sprinting through the West Wing, phones in hand, and setting up a podium for Mr. Biden to deliver his remarks alongside Ms. Harris in Cross Hall. Just after the verdict was delivered the president was on the phone with members of Mr. Floyd\u2019s family. \u201cWe\u2019re all so relieved,\u201d Mr. Biden said to a group of people who included Ben Crump, the Floyd family\u2019s attorney. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to see you guys, I really am.

It is a problem for every American. It is keeping us from fulfilling the promise of liberty and justice for all, and it is holding our nation back from realizing our full potential.\u201d Mr. Biden can trace his political success, in part, to how he responded to the nationwide protests that rose up in the wake of Mr. Floyd\u2019s death. Last June, as his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, stoked tensions by tweet, calling the protests a result of the \u201cradical left\u201d and threatening to send in the National Guard, Mr. Biden traveled to Houston with his wife, Jill, to meet with Mr. Floyd\u2019s relatives. The hour he spent with the Floyd family effectively created a split-screen with Mr. Trump that boosted his war chest and added momentum to his campaign. \u201cI won\u2019t fan the flames of hate,\u201d Mr. Biden said at the time. \u201cI will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country \u2014 not use them for political gain.\u201d", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Gina McCarthy, Obama\u2019s E.P.A. chief, is back and ready to rebuild a legacy dismantled during Trump.

Sarah Blesener for The New York Times Gina McCarthy worked six or seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day, to produce America\u2019s first real effort to combat climate change, a suite of Obama-era regulations that would cut pollution from the nation\u2019s tailpipes and smokestacks and wean the world\u2019s largest economy from fossil fuels. Then the administration of Donald J. Trump shredded the work of President Barack Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency chief before any of it could take effect. Now Ms. McCarthy is back as President Biden\u2019s senior climate change adviser, and this time, she is determined to make it stick. She is the most powerful climate change official in the country other than Mr. Biden himself, and her charge is not simply to reconstruct her Obama-era policies but to lead an entire government to tackle global warming, from the nation\u2019s military to its diplomatic corps to its Treasury and Transportation Department. She will also lead negotiations with Congress for permanent new climate change laws that could withstand the next change of administration. \u201cI\u2019ve got a small stronghold office, but I am an orchestra leader for a very large band,\u201d Ms. McCarthy, 66, said in a speech in February.

Mr. Biden is expected to pledge that the United States will cut its planet-warming emissions by at least 50 percent below 2005 levels in the next decade. The world has seen such promises before, with the Kyoto accords in the 1990s, then the Paris Agreement in the Obama era, only to see them discarded by subsequent Republican administrations. It will fall to Ms. McCarthy to prove the skeptics wrong. The administration plans concurrent efforts to enact regulations to curb auto and power plant emissions, restrict fossil fuel development and conserve public lands while pressing Congress to pass the climate provisions in Mr. Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure bill, such as renewable power and electric vehicle programs. Ms. McCarthy hopes to push the infrastructure bill further, possibly by mandating that power companies produce a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. That will be a tough sell to many Republicans \u2014 but if it passes Congress, it could stand as the Biden administration\u2019s permanent climate legacy, even if other rules are swept away by future presidents.", "South Korea\u2019s leader pushes Biden to negotiate with the North after Trump \u2018failed.\u2019 President Moon Jae-in of South Korea during an interview at the Blue House in Seoul.

In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Moon pushed the American leader to kick start negotiations with the government of Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, after two years in which diplomatic progress stalled, even reversed. Denuclearization, the South Korean president said, was a \u201cmatter of survival\u201d for his country. He also urged the United States to cooperate with China on North Korea and other issues of global concern, including climate change. The deteriorating relations between the superpowers, he said, could undermine any negotiations over denuclearization.

Mr. Moon, who is set to meet with Mr. Biden next month in Washington, appeared ready to step once again into the role of mediator between the two sides. In the interview, Mr. Moon \u200bwas proud of his deft diplomatic maneuvering in 2018, when he steered the two unpredictable leaders of North Korea and the United States to meet in person.

Mr. Biden was eager for the praise that would come from vastly increasing Mr. Trump\u2019s record-low limit, people familiar with his thinking said, and he decided to increase the cap even earlier than the usual start of the fiscal year, Oct. 1.

Now, a decision to raise the refugee limit to 62,500 \u2014 as Mr. Biden had promised only weeks earlier to members of Congress \u2014 would invite from Republicans new attacks of hypocrisy and open borders even as the president was calling for bipartisanship.
