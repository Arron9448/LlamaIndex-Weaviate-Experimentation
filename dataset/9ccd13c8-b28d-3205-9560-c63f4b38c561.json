In fact, when I first met him, I asked him what he did. I remember him being very courteous. He was an absolute gentleman and would call me \"Miss Dolores.\" And then I learned what a talented singer he was. By the time we did our second film, we couldn\u2019t walk down the street because there were so many people waiting for him, just wanting to touch him.", "I remember one moment when we were taking a break from filming. He walked over to me, handed me a Bible, and said, \"Miss Dolores, would you open this book? What do you see? What does it mean to you?\" And so, I offered my opinion on what I was seeing. And from there, we spent the time in between the scenes talking about the Bible. I never expected a fellow actor, in particular, to have that kind of genuine curiosity. He wasn\u2019t trying to set up anything. There were no flashbulbs around to take pictures of us. He did it because it was in his heart.", "Fox News: Is it true you made Elvis Presley blush on set?", "Hart: Well, it\u2019s true *laughs*. We both had to do a kissing scene, for [1957\u2019s] \"Loving You,\" which is a riot in itself. It\u2019s the last scene of the film, but when you walk in on set, you\u2019re told, \"This is the first thing you\u2019re going to do.\" I remember I had to put my arms around him and kiss him. There were about 100 people on the soundstage. Seconds into it, the director, Hal Kanter, yells \"Cut!\" I thought, \"Oh no, how can I kiss wrong?\"", "\u2018GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\u2019 STAR TINA LOUISE PAYS TRIBUTE TO DAWN WELLS", "He immediately asks for the makeup man to come over to fix me up.

After they fixed me up, we started again. And again, seconds later, he yells \"Cut! Get some makeup for Mister Presley!\" When I looked, he was red! But that\u2019s the way it was. We were just a couple of kids. But he was a simple and true man.", "Fox News: Looking back, why did you leave Hollywood?", "Hart: I think it\u2019s important for anyone to understand that it was a dramatic change. It wasn\u2019t something I planned on. I thought I would go through my time in Hollywood. However, this vocation showed me my life\u2019s purpose. Then I started to ask myself, \"What am I doing in Hollywood? Where is this going to take me?\" The realization became clear and really, it\u2019s a gift. I was so lucky. God called me.", "Fox News: How did you discover the Abbey of Regina Laudis?", "Hart: I was actually doing a show at the time, but the demands of the stage really became exhausting. It was a friend who suggested that I should take a few days to rest at the Abbey of Regina Laudis. It was supposed to be a welcoming retreat from New York where I could reflect on what was going to be the next step in my career.", "But I wasn\u2019t expecting just how peaceful it truly was. I found inner certitude. I felt like this is where I belonged. It became more than just a retreat. It\u2019s the kind of feeling you get when you meet the person you\u2019re going to marry. The more I came to visit the more it came calling to me. And the more I knew God was present to me in a very special way that I couldn\u2019t deny.", "DEAN MARTIN\u2019S DAUGHTER DEANA SAYS SHE STILL FEELS RAT PACK STAR\u2019S PRESENCE: \u2018HE IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME\u2019", "Fox News: You were engaged to Don Robinson.

I had a concern that somehow I wasn\u2019t sure [about the engagement]\u2026 He was a beautiful guy and a real gentleman too. He was also an architect and built houses.

Edith said she found this wedding dress that she thought would be perfect for me. I tried to explain that I wasn't quite ready, but the next thing I knew, the dress was featured in this magazine with my name tagged onto it. Throughout this whole time, I was worried.

I cannot say yes to this.\" He stood up from the table and yelled \"No!\" And of course, everyone at the restaurant looked at us. I looked at him and said, \"Don, I\u2019m telling you the truth. I really love you, but not in the way that you want.\"", "Then I told him what I really wanted to do with my life. God was calling me and I felt it in my heart that I needed to answer.

And up until the day he died [in 2011] he came to the Abbey at least once a year to help in any way he could, to work in areas that would be acceptable. And he never married. I remember he once told me, \"Every love doesn\u2019t have to wind up at the altar.\" I believe Don is now with the Lord.", "Fox News: How do you feel about Hollywood today?", "Hart: I think Hollywood belonged to our time as a way for young people to find an identity, to feel a sense of importance, a sense of being, a sense of belonging.
