Kelly had asked Sale for an interview. But he planned an ambush.", "Kelly had just read an early copy of Sale\u2019s upcoming book, called Rebels Against the Future. It told the story of the 19th-century Luddites, a movement of workers opposed to the machinery of the Industrial Revolution. Before their rebellion was squashed and their leaders hanged, they literally destroyed some of the mechanized looms that, they believed, reduced them to cogs in a dehumanizing engine of mass production.", "Sale adored the Luddites. In early 1995, Amazon was less than a year old, Apple was in the doldrums, Microsoft had yet to launch Windows 95, and almost no one had a mobile phone. But Sale, who for years had been churning out books complaining about modernity and urging a return to a subsistence economy, felt that computer technology would make life worse for humans. Sale had even channeled the Luddites at a January event in New York City where he attacked an IBM PC with a 10-pound sledgehammer. It took him two blows to vanquish the object, after which he took a bow and sat down, deeply satisfied.", "Kelly hated Sale\u2019s book. His reaction went beyond mere disagreement; Sale\u2019s thesis insulted his sense of the world. So he showed up at Sale\u2019s door not just in search of a verbal brawl but with a plan to expose what he saw as the wrongheadedness of Sale\u2019s ideas. Kelly set up his tape recorder on a table while Sale sat behind his desk.", "Sign Up Today Sign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.", "The visit was all business, Sale recalls. \u201cNo eats, no coffee, no particular camaraderie,\u201d he says. Sale had prepped for the interview by reading a few issues of WIRED\u2014he\u2019d never heard of it before Kelly contacted him\u2014and he expected a tough interview. He later described it as downright \u201chostile, no pretense of objective journalism.\u201d (Kelly later called it adversarial, \u201cbecause he was an adversary, and he probably viewed me the same way.\u201d) They argued about the Amish, whether printing presses denuded forests, and the impact of technology on work. Sale believed it stole decent labor from people. Kelly replied that technology helped us make new things we couldn\u2019t make any other way. \u201cI regard that as trivial,\u201d Sale said.", "Sale believed society was on the verge of collapse. That wasn\u2019t entirely bad, he argued. He hoped the few surviving humans would band together in small, tribal-style clusters. They wouldn\u2019t be just off the grid. There would be no grid. Which was dandy, as far as Sale was concerned.", "\u201cHistory is full of civilizations that have collapsed, followed by people who have had other ways of living,\u201d Sale said. \u201cMy optimism is based on the certainty that civilization will collapse.\u201d", "That was the opening Kelly had been waiting for. In the final pages of his Luddite book, Sale had predicted society would collapse \u201cwithin not more than a few decades.\u201d Kelly, who saw technology as an enriching force, believed the opposite\u2014that society would flourish. Baiting his trap, Kelly asked just when Sale thought this might happen.", "Sale was a bit taken aback\u2014he\u2019d never put a date on it. Finally, he blurted out 2020. It seemed like a good round number.", "Kelly then asked how, in a quarter century, one might determine whether Sale was right.", "Sale extemporaneously cited three factors: an economic disaster that would render the dollar worthless, causing a depression worse than the one in 1930; a rebellion of the poor against the monied; and a significant number of environmental catastrophes.", "\u201cWould you be willing to bet on your view?\u201d Kelly asked.", "\u201cSure,\u201d Sale said.", "Then Kelly sprung his trap. He had come to Sale\u2019s apartment with a $1,000 check drawn on his joint account with this wife. Now he handed it to his startled interview subject. \u201cI bet you $1,000 that in the year 2020, we\u2019re not even close to the kind of disaster you describe,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Steven Levy", "Steven Lev"], "keywords": ["25yearold", "book", "kelly", "believed", "luddites", "comes", "destroyed", "interview", "technology", "bet", "sale", "asked", "tech", "society", "sales"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
