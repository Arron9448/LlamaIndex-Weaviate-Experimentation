Inspired by the gothic romance of Eiko Ishioka\u2019s costumes from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy went all-in on embellishment and revisited extreme silhouettes from bygone eras. Naturally, the textured brocades, lace veils, and sequins chosen by the Mulleavys struck a chord with their brand\u2019s famous fans, and this weekend on Instagram, Mindy Kaling wore one of the most compelling pieces. The actress-producer was at her sartorial best in a petal pink, silk-chiffon maxi dress detailed with ruffles and an appliqu\u00e9 rose. Unabashedly feminine with hearts and microfloral prints splashed across every inch, the dress was pure feel-good fashion.", "On the red carpet and in her social media updates, Kaling gravitates towards cheerful clothes\u2014bright colors, expressive prints, and plenty of statement accessories. The Rodarte piece aligns with her tastes in fashion and art. Whether she\u2019s writing her latest series, penning a New Yorker article on rom-coms, or tweeting her thoughts about Bridgerton, Kaling is a die-hard romantic. When you find an outfit that connects with who you are, it\u2019s news worth sharing, and on Instagram, she acknowledged her latest look with a coy caption that read, \u201cwearing my heart on my sle-- dress\u201d", "Of course, you don\u2019t have to make movies to appreciate the Mulleavys\u2019 work. After all the uninspiring at-home fashion of 2020, the runway\u2019s fun factor has never seemed more enticing. Most collections still skew serious, but pieces that offer whimsy always elicit smiles. With good times in short supply, feel-good clothes and the mood boost are all the more special."], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["good", "feel", "rodarte", "latest", "pieces", "2020", "fashion", "feelgood", "deliver", "instagram", "kaling", "dress", "mulleavys", "prints", "moment", "mindy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
