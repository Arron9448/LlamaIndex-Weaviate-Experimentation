My name is Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.", "Health professionals fear that England\u2019s test-and-trace system will fail to prevent further surges of coronavirus without radical improvements by spring, with particular concern over the use of inexperienced call centre workers to carry out the role of trained staff. The government\u2019s much-criticised \u00a322bn system is under increasing strain as the number of infected people continues to grow. One health worker with 40 years experience has written to health secretary, Matt Hancock, to warn him about the mistakes being made by untrained staff, who are often employed on minimum wage by telesales firms contracted by Serco. The alarm came after Hancock refused to rule out a tightening of restrictions in England and urged people to follow the rules. However, he was optimistic that new mass vaccinations centres being opened around the country today would accelerate the rollout and help reach the target of everyone in the priority groups \u2013 care home residents and staff, NHS and care staff, the over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable \u2013 being offered a jab by 15 February. More than 54,000 new cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday to take the total to 3.08 million. But modelling seen by the Guardian suggest one in five people across England may have had coronavirus, equivalent to 12.4 million people, rising to almost one in two in some areas. Bodies are being stored at a temporary mortuary in Surrey because capacity at hospitals has been exceeded.", "A new survey of headteachers today shows that nearly half are being forced to prioritise class places among vulnerable students and the children of key workers because of a huge increase in demand. Some heads reported up to 60% of all pupils are attending school in the new lockdown. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has called on Rishi Sunak to provide more financial help for working parents coping with the lockdown in England. A team of WHO experts will be allowed into China later this week to investigate the origins of the virus. In France, the government is also pushing ahead with vaccinations, despite scepticism from the public, represented by a poll showing 60% of people are unwilling to have the Covid jab.

House speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to colleagues last night outlining her plans which will involve passing legislation this morning to enable the use of the 25th amendment. Under such a move, Pence would become acting president. As the aftermath of the US Capitol riot continued, two men believed to have taken zip-tie handcuffs into the Capitol building have been arrested and charged, and Twitter said it had stopped the phrase \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d from trending. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former Republican governor of California, renewed his criticism of Trump by comparing the riot incited by the president incited to Kristallnacht, the infamous Nazi attack on Jews in 1938.", "Crime cutters \u2013 Police forces will be asked to reduce crime by up to 20% under radical plans drawn up by the government, the Guardian has learned. Amid concern that the Covid-inspired recession is causing a rise in crime, ministers want to bring down rates of homicide, serious violent crime and other offences across England and Wales in exchange for 20,000 new officers. But senior officers fear the idea would be a return to the widely derided setting of targets by Whitehall.", "Giants of the deep \u2013 Megalodons, the giant sharks which patrolled the world\u2019s oceans more than 3m years ago, gave birth to babies larger than most adult humans, according scientists in the US who have been studying fossils of the prehistoric creatures. The fossils suggest the megalodon infants were up to 2 metres long at birth. Adults could grow to more than 15 metres in length.", "Broker Britain \u2013 Britain should reinvent itself as a global powerbroker for challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, global health and human rights in the post-Brexit world rather than as a mini-great power, according to a leading thinktank. Robin Niblett, the director general of Chatham House, warns the government not to indulge in nostalgic fantasies about \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d and that it would be a mistake to set itself up as a foreign policy rival to the European Union. The post-Brexit world has also forced Labour leader Keir Starmer to abandon the commitment to free movement of people in the EU he made to party members during the party\u2019s leadership contest.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sex and the City will return this year.

Three of the four stars of the original show, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis, ended rumours about a possible reboot when they shared a trailer for the new series on social media platforms.

Six Nations organisers are striving to convince the French government the championship can go ahead safely with the introduction of a series of stricter Covid-19 protocols \u2013 including expanding their testing programme \u2013 after it emerged the women\u2019s competition is set to be postponed. At the end of an awful, often acrimonious week, blemished by an amalgam of controversy, Covid-19 and multiple postponements, Fran Kirby cut through the gloom engulfing the Women\u2019s Super League. After flapping at a stoppage-time cross to give Newport of League Two an extraordinary equaliser, Brighton\u2019s backup goalkeeper Jason Steele made four fine penalty shootout saves to help the Premier League strugglers advance to the FA Cup fourth round and spare any embarrassment after the ordeal of a nail-biting tie.
