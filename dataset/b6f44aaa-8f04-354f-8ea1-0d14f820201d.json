Others have simply fled.", "The Jalisco cartel, Mexico\u2019s fastest-expanding criminal network, considers Michoac\u00e1n, rich in international trafficking routes and extortion markets, a key building block in its bid for national criminal hegemony. A source in the cartel said that gaining control over Michoac\u00e1n was an \u201cobsession\u201d of the group\u2019s leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, who was born in the state.", "But its decade-long attempt to take over the region has so far been frustrated by the local opponents\u2019 deep political and social roots. With neither side able to impose its designs on the other or willing to back down, more than 15,500 homicides have been recorded here from January 2011 to February this year.", "The fighting goes hand-in-hand with the struggle for political power.

This can be achieved through illicit campaign financing, which can later provide perks such as being able to tap into state finances and influence the actions of state security institutions.", "One high-ranking lieutenant in a local faction that is currently non-aligned in the conflict said his group\u2019s attempts to take on the United Cartels had failed because of the group\u2019s powerful political connections.", "He said: \u201cThey have the state government on their side \u2026 and when we try to attack, they send helicopters and launch operations.\u201d", "He hoped that his own group could balance things out by channeling votes from its area of control to a high-level candidate.

Calder\u00f3n hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed. Kingpin strategy Simultaneously Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders. That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps \u2013 notably Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva who was gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009 \u2013 but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie. Under Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups. But Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. When \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d. But the violence went on. By the time Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain. \"Hugs not bullets\" The leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime, offering vocational training to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.", "\u201cIt will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,\u201d Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his \u201chugs not bullets\u201d doctrine. Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong \"National Guard\". But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants. Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.", "\u201cHe wants to avoid the high political costs past governments have suffered after they declared war against organized crime, so that he can achieve other priorities like structural reforms instead\u201d such as in the energy sector, Maldonado said.", "\u201cThe president\u2019s view of organised crime is one that focuses on [helping] young people without work, but he completely ignores the enormous institutional corruption and state capture at the local level.\u201d", "Criminal operatives in various rival factions, local civilians and activists, agree that the problem of state complicity goes beyond simple inertia.", "Soldiers and police, they say, have drawn up alliances with those they are meant to fight.", "\u201cThe truth is,\u201d one local said, \u201cthat the army and the national guard are allied with [United Cartels] \u2026 they are working together, they are doing operations together, some criminal leaders are even [embedded] with the army, riding in their helicopters and wearing their uniforms.\u201d", "Opposing criminal groups collaborate with different factions of the state in different geographical areas, leveling out advantages and perpetuating deadly violence.", "\u201cThere are a lot of pacts [between state and crime],\u201d said a white-collar broker providing services to the Jalisco cartel, \u201cbut only at the local and regional level. There is no one big pact.\u201d This, he added, also helped to explain frequent attacks on the security forces by armed groups seeking to disrupt other factions\u2019 arrangements.", "Commanders of Mexico\u2019s armed forces have repeatedly denied all allegations of corruption, saying that \u201cno deviations of any type are tolerated\u201d.
