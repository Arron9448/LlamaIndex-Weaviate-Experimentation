Midafternoon was the only time Gorman could steal away from her overstuffed schedule. Last week there had been a guest spot on the Hillary Clinton podcast, and next week there would be a panel with Oprah. It was Gorman who remembered to bring the blankets, and hers was embroidered with astrological signs. (\u201cAs a twin, I love being a Pisces, because it\u2019s the two fish,\u201d she said. She and her sister are best friends.) Her smallness is formidable. The next time we met, she brought her lunch\u2014a veggie burger in Tupperware\u2014and snacks for me: artisanal popcorn, gummi bears, a caramel. A meal gave me occasion to glimpse her unmasked, under a face shield. Her profile sends you back to the golden age of the supermodel. Her laughter is a great ringing noise. As we took in the sun on our patch of lawn, Gorman reflected on the long journey of her short life: \u201cIt took so much labor, not only on behalf of me, but also of my family and of my village, to get here.\u201d A toddler in tie-dyed leggings waddled dangerously near to us. Gorman paused and leaned back faux-dramatically. The kid tittered. I had no way of knowing\u2014apart from the telltale stretch of the two masks that covered most of Gorman\u2019s face\u2014but it looked like she was grinning.", "\u201cIt took so much labor, not only on behalf of me, but also of my family and of my village, to get here\u201d", "\u201cAre you going to start the story with \u2018One day, I met Amanda Gorman in Los Angeles\u2019?\u201d she teased. The acute enjoyment she takes in words is palpable. Her speech quickens whenever she realizes that a sentence she is constructing amounts to an interesting assonance\u2014which is often\u2014as when she described the oratorical styles of Revs. Ralph Abernathy and Martin Luther King Jr: \u201cThe way they let their words roll and gain momentum is its own type of sound tradition.\u201d She takes it upon herself to fill silences, sometimes with words and other times with sound effects. \u201cDo do do do do doooo,\u201d she bounced as her mind worked on a response to a question about her relationship to Clinton, whom she\u2019s known personally for some years. \u201cSuch a grandma,\u201d she said affectionately. Other figures of the Democratic Party, whom she chatted with after the January ceremony, were described in similarly familial terms: Barack Obama, dadlike; Michelle Obama, the cool auntie. In the weeks after we met, Gorman, or radiations of Gorman, were everywhere: on a February cover of Time, posed in her yellow, and inside the magazine, holding a caged bird, invoking Maya Angelou, interviewed by Michelle Obama; performing virtually at \u201cHam4Progress Presents: The Joy in Our Voices,\u201d a Black History Month celebration from the people behind the Hamilton phenomenon; on an International Women\u2019s Day panel with Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chrissy Teigen; in media headlines, nearly every time she tweeted her opinion on a current event; memorialized on vibrant murals in D.C. and Palm Springs that reminded me of Shepard Fairey\u2019s Obama posters.", "After the inauguration, she completed a tour of the big talk shows, remotely, from her L.A. apartment. It was a scene. The Trump years and the pandemic had starved the circuit of joy, elegance, positivity, intelligence, hope. But when Gorman came onscreen it was as if DeGeneres, Corden, and Noah had sprung alive from a slumber. She matched the comedians\u2019 wit, the embodiment of spring in her teal. On his nighttime news digest, Anderson Cooper 360, Cooper asked Gorman to repeat the rhyming mantra she recites before she steps onstage: \u201cI am the daughter of Black writers who are descended from Freedom Fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me.\u201d Cooper visibly reddened at her recitation, his composure utterly destroyed. \u201cWow,\u201d he almost babbled. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome.\u201d", "\u201cI have yet to see her finish without a standing ovation,\u201d observed Aaron Kisner, a stage director who has worked with Gorman on a few of her public performances. The friends, colleagues, and family of Gorman\u2019s that I spoke to all unilaterally said that they weren\u2019t surprised by her success. If you book Amanda Gorman, her mother, Joan Wicks, told me, \u201cyou don\u2019t feel like you are taking a chance.\u201d The audience, for Gorman, is not an abstraction but a collaborator in her mode of rousing, outward-facing, and civic-minded poetical speech. She is something of a caring instructor, translating critical race theory for the benefit of eager Americans. Gorman works in the affirmative mode of reaction and response; I spent hours absorbing her poems, which is to say, viewing her performances of them on YouTube. For the dying climate, she has written \u201cEarthrise.\u201d For the modern crisis of white-supremacist violence, in all its forms, she wrote \u201cIn This Place (An American Lyric),\u201d her most ambitious work, a poem she delivered at the inauguration of Tracy K. Smith as the poet laureate of the United States. In 2017, Gorman herself was named the first National Youth Poet Laureate."], "authors": ["Doreen St. F\u00e9lix", "Doreen St. F\u00e9li", "Annie Leibovit", "Gabriella Karefa-Johnso"], "keywords": ["met", "words", "amanda", "star", "clinton", "obama", "cooper", "worked", "literary", "gorman", "family", "day", "took"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
