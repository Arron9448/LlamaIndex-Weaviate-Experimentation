Over the last few years, an increase in woman-helmed spirits brands have helped close the field\u2019s gender gap. Even in the past year alone, many more have joined the trade. In support of the strong female figures adding a new edge to a thriving industry, we\u2019ve compiled our favorite new woman-owned spirits to get and gift ahead of the new year.", "Current Cassis", "Adorable packaging aside, Current Cassis founder Rachael Petach really nailed it with her ode to a contemporary blackcurrant liqueur (375ml/16% ABV). Produced with local blackcurrants from New York\u2019s Catskills region, Petach developed a fresh and vibrant liqueur that\u2019s a far cry from France\u2019s traditional cloying cassis liqueurs. Instead of white sugar, Petach subtly sweetens hers with just enough wild honey to counter the fruit\u2019s natural acidity, and she adds depth to the drink with spices like green cardamom and lemon verbena.", "Current Cassis Botanical Black Currant Liqueur $28 UPSTREAM WINE & SPIRITS Shop Now", "Kasama Rum", "Hailing from a somewhat famed beverage lineage, as the daughter to Chopin and Belvedere Vodka founder Tad Dorda, Alexandra Dorda is joining the family business with her soft-launched Filipino rum, Kasama (750ml/40% ABV). Distilled from sugarcane in the Philippines and aged seven years, this richly-flavored spirit offers hints of butterscotch followed by layers of tropical fruit.", "21 Seeds", "Keen to offer a cleaner spirit that speaks to today\u2019s wellness-minded imbibers, this past summer sisters Kat Hantas and Nicole Emanuel, along with their friend Sarika Singh, officially rolled out 21 Seeds, their blanco Tequila label that highlights fruit infusions. Produced in Jalisco, Mexico at a woman-run distillery, this burnt orange hued liquor (750ml/35% ABV) calls for Veracruz-grown grapefruit and hibiscus, which they macerate with the tequila before straining it out and bottling.", "21 Seeds Grapefruit Hibiscus Tequila $35 RESERVE BAR Shop Now", "Freeland Dry Gin", "During this year\u2019s first COVID shutdown, Jill Kuehler\u2014founder of Portland, Oregon\u2019s Freeland Spirits\u2014began R&D for this navy-strength, high-proof gin (750ml/57% ABV).

Leslie Merinoff is Matchbook Distilling Company\u2019s driving force, and it\u2019s here that she\u2019s made a business of custom distillations from ingredients like palo santo and koji. But beyond bespoke orders, she bottles seasonal specials, like her new Elsewhere Blood Orange Aperitivo (750ml/30% ABV). Think of this as an upgraded Aperol, made with seasonal blood oranges, spices like pink peppercorns and cardamom, and fortified with a neutral spirit she distills from organic Finger Lakes, New York corn.", "Elsewhere Blood Orange Aperitivo $40 MATCHBOOK DROP SHOP Shop Now", "Harridan Vodka", "With its hand-blown recycled glass bottles and vintage-inspired label, Harridan Vodka (750ml/44% ABV)\u2013\u2013founded by business strategist Bridgette Taylor\u2013\u2013would fit seamlessly on any ancient apothecary shelf.

Marin debuted Catskill Provisions Distillery last year in the company\u2019s namesake New York region. After rolling out a few sustainably-made spirits distilled from locally-grown, non-GMO fruits and grains, her newest holiday release is a maple-laced bourbon (750ml/40$ ABV). The drink is made from a majority of local corn plus rye and malted barley, aged for four years, then finished in maple syrup-coated barrels for several days before bottling.

So, it\u2019s only fitting that co-founder Laura Giraudo decided to house the succulent\u2019s distillation in a stunning modernist vessel that honors the juice within.
