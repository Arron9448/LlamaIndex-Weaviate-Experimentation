Scientists mastered the technologies that would identify the function of plant genes; the National Science Foundation started a post-doctoral fellowship programme in plants to attract new people into the field; and Barbara McClintock, a maize geneticist, won the Nobel prize. Plants had cachet! What followed was 30 years of spectacular discoveries.", "That record of success inspired my plant-biology colleagues (Wolfgang Busch, Joseph Ecker, Julie Law, Joseph Noel) and me. In 2016 a Salk Institute trustee, Howard Newman, and Salk\u2019s then president, Elizabeth Blackburn, challenged us to tackle larger problems. We asked ourselves: could we use our knowledge of photosynthesis and our collective expertise as plant biologists to help plants store more carbon from CO2 than usual and keep it trapped underground for longer than usual?", "We knew that plants capture more carbon every year through photosynthesis than we need to remove from the atmosphere. We also knew that they release most of that carbon back into the atmosphere at the end of every growing season. We reasoned that we could increase net carbon storage by identifying and controlling genes for just three traits\u2014root mass, root depth and root carbon content\u2014such that the new plants store more carbon in suberin, a natural polymer that is resistant to decomposition (cork is one type of suberin). And by focusing on six prevalent crop plants\u00ad\u2014corn, soya\u00adbeans, rice, wheat, cotton and canola\u2014we could accomplish the carbon capture without disrupting the food production critical to feed the world\u2019s growing population, all while improving soil that has been depleted of carbon and other nutrients over decades of intensive modern farming.", "The quest to sequester", "Our ambitious aim is for these solutions to be ready to draw down CO2 at a global scale in ten years. Over time, our carbon-sequestering crops will even contribute to net negative emissions.", "Without early-stage philanthropic funding and our donors, we would still just have an idea waiting to be tested. But we also need policymakers, economists, governments and public-private partnerships to create and implement the necessary incentives to encourage the adoption and practical roll-out of initiatives like ours.", "For example, we need economic programmes that allow farmers to monetise the extra carbon they sequester, and pilot programmes (such as the California Soil Carbon Demonstration Trial) for baseline and subsequent measurements of soil carbon content to determine its effect on agricultural productivity. We need regulatory approvals and worldwide distribution through global seed companies and NGOs with relationships to small-farm holders.", "There are clearly examples where science, technology and policy have converged to solve global threats. For our effort to succeed, we need nothing less than the type of federal investment and partnerships between the public and private sectors that led to the lifesaving public-health response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. AIDS came to national prominence in America in June 1981, when the United States Centres for Disease Control (CDC) issued its weekly report detailing cases of a rare lung infection in five previously healthy gay men. By the end of the year the CDC had documented hundreds of cases of severe immune deficiency. By 1982 community groups had begun mobilising and Congress held its first hearings. In May 1983 it passed legislation to allocate $5m to the CDC for surveillance and $10m to the National Institutes of Health for research. Federal funding for HIV research and treatment went from a few hundred thousand dollars in 1982 to $28bn in 2019. HIV is now a manageable, chronic illness in America.", "A key figure who helped turn the tide on HIV/AIDS was America\u2019s surgeon-general, C. Everett Koop. He developed the \u201cSurgeon General\u2019s Report on AIDS\u201d, released in 1986, and in 1988 launched the country\u2019s first co-ordinated HIV/AIDS campaign, which included sending a booklet to every American household. In his 1986 report on AIDS Koop wrote: \u201cWe are fighting a disease, not people\u2026The country must face this epidemic as a unified society.\u201d", "In 2020 we must take a page from Koop\u2019s book: we are fighting ecological catastrophe, not people. The world must face this challenge as a unified society. We need all hands on deck.", "This article appeared in the Science and technology section of the print edition under the headline \"Planting a big idea\""], "authors": [], "keywords": ["carbon", "fight", "plant", "hivaids", "power", "need", "soil", "change", "global", "science", "climate", "national", "plants", "report"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
