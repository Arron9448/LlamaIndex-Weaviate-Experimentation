Stop at Plas Newydd, home of the Marquess of Anglesey. This grand home dates back to the 15th-century and boasts fantastic views over the Menai Strait to Snowdonia. Enjoy a stroll around the gardens and grounds as you learn more about the history of the house before the tour continues to the captivating seaside town of Beaumaris, at the eastern end of the Menai Strait. Beaumaris\u2019 UNESCO-listed castle dates back to the 13th century, when Edward I ordered its construction as part of his campaign to conquer Wales. However, construction of the castle was abandoned in the early 14th century when resources were diverted toward the invasion of Scotland. The unfinished castle was then occupied by the Welsh, and taken back by the English, and then reoccupied by forces loyal to Charles I during the English Civil War. Today, the castle remains as it was then: an unfinished masterpiece of near complete symmetry. The tour manager will bring the castle\u2019s fascinating history to life, regaling you with tales stretching back the best part of a thousand years. Enjoy some free time for lunch in the town (payable locally) before continuing across the Menai Suspension Bridge to Caernarfon, on the Welsh mainland. The UNESCO-listed Caernarfon castle was also built as part of Edward I\u2019s efforts to conquer Wales. Recognised as one of the great fortified buildings of the Middle Ages, the impressive Caernarfon castle took 47 years to complete, at a cost of \u00a325,000 and contained an entire town! Your tour manager will give a talk outside the castle, and there will be time for those who wish to enter to do so (entrance payable locally). Depart Caernarfon in the late afternoon, after a fascinating day filled with myths and legends. Later on, an included dinner at your hotel rounds off a wonderful day."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["unfinished", "manager", "caernarfon", "scenic", "menai", "north", "chester", "tour", "unescolisted", "welsh", "town", "castle", "wales"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
