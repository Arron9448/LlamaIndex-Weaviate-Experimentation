There is a danger of young people going vegan, not having B12 and it could tip the balance to them getting a serious neuropathy.\u201d", "The great vegan Christmas taste test: mains, desserts and party food Read more", "It could easily be remedied by the manufacturers of plant-based milks, he said. \u201cLevels should be higher in plant milks than they are at the moment.

Other aspects of the vegan diet are healthy but, said Sanders, \u201cB12 is the one thing we are concerned about\u201d. There is particular worry about children. In one case, a baby who was breastfed by a mother who was B12 deficient ended up with neuropathy.", "Sanders and Tim Key, professor of epidemiology and deputy director of the Cancer Epidemiology unit at Oxford University, have both researched the health of those who eat a vegan diet for many years. Key is himself a vegan \u2013 and takes vitamin B12 tablets regularly.", "Key said there was limited data available. The Epic study based at Oxford follows about 2,000 people. Together with a study in California, there is data on about 10,000 people in total. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.
