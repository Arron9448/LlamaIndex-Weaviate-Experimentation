Good afternoon.", "My name is Arielle Pardes.", "I'm a senior writer with WIRED and", "I am joined today by Arlen Hamilton, the founder,", "and managing partner of Backstage Capital", "and Katie Rae,", "the CEO and managing partner of The Engine.", "Welcome to both of you.", "Thank you.", "Hi thank you for having us.", "I could not have asked for two better people", "to talk to today about my favorite topic in tech,", "which is the money.", "We're gonna be talking about how", "we build the stuff that matters,", "which often comes down to funding the stuff that matters.", "And that is where both of you come in.", "So Arlen, I wanna start with you.", "You founded Backstage Capital almost exactly five years ago,", "and the mission was to invest in underestimated founders.", "So I wanna ask what that word means to you and what kind", "of opportunity you saw in these underestimated founders that", "other investors weren't seeing.", "Sure.", "So yeah, we celebrated five years a week ago today.", "We... so underestimated is actually a term", "that was gifted to me by one of our founders three years ago", "during our second year anniversary.", "And it really is just speaks to the difference between", "thinking of black and brown founders and women in general,", "at founders as a charity or competition.", "And what we want you to be...what we want people to hear", "when they hear underrepresented or underestimated is", "that's your competition.", "That someone or a group of people", "who have been overlooked and discounted,", "but it's not to say that they're not on par with you,", "or maybe in some cases,", "even beyond your reach and are lapping you in fact.", "And so seven or eight years ago,", "when I was looking into the world of Silicon Valley and", "other tech hubs,", "which were few and far between at the time", "when I came across the statistic that 90% of venture funding", "goes to straight white men", "and they make up a third of the country.", "It didn't make any sense to me.", "And so I started looking around as a gay black woman", "thinking, well, first thought was that sucks", "because where does that leave me?", "But then it really quickly turned into", "what an opportunity.", "What a gift that so many people are overlooking us", "and taking us for granted to be honest.", "And so my thought was,", "if we have done so much with so little as I've seen so many", "of us do what would happen if we were given more,", "if we had that slight chance that was not afforded to us", "prior.", "And so first I went out asking people to do this.", "And then once I realized I was... it was falling", "on deaf ears I said, I'll attempt it myself.", "And so I put together a few million dollars from scratch to", "do that over the years.", "I love that idea of if people have been working on so", "little, because they're so underestimated,", "what would happen if you gave them more?", "And I wanna return to that concept because I think it's", "really powerful, but Katie,", "you're also reaching a slightly different set of founders", "and companies with your fund, The Engine though,", "as I understand it,", "your founders and companies often need more to do more.", "They need more upfront capital.", "They need more time in their development cycles.", "And so I wanna ask you the same question.", "What was the opportunity that you saw as an investor in", "taking a chance on some of the companies", "that you've invested in?", "Yeah, so if you take a look at what The Engine does,", "we back really transformational technology that could shape", "a market and solve a huge world problem all in a go,", "right?", "And, but it requires patience, it requires capital,", "and it requires imagination on how to get these types of", "companies to market, right?", "It's not just straight software.", "So if you're gonna change the world's energy grid to be", "carbon free, you know,", "you only have a few transformational technologies that could", "work to do that.", "So you have to reach back into, you know,", "the best universities in the world.", "We're partnered with MIT.", "And look at how could that happen and then back founders to", "do that.", "But it means that your timeframes to market are often,", "you know, 10 years, not two or one or zero.", "And it means that you could potentially be having to raise,", "you know, a hundred million dollar first round,", "not one to two.", "So that means that you have to be creative about the", "capital raising, creative about how to back companies", "like this.", "But the opportunity, the economic opportunity is enormous.", "But you have to have the wherewithal", "to pull that all together.", "And so that's what we do at The Engine.", "And, you know, we back founders coming out of PhD programs,", "postdocs, professors who have created these real", "breakthroughs, across many, many industries.", "Whether it's de-carbonization, the energy grid or how we", "can truly extend human life in meaningful ways", "to a very large set of the population", "or how we're better connected.", "So we think of that as advanced systems.", "All of those are really important for our planet and", "under invested in because they look more complex or it's not", "in the regular playbook.", "But we just are,", "we're psyched that we have that opportunity.", "And we think we'll make a ton of progress for the planet,", "but also returns for our investors.", "I'm very glad that you brought that up because", "neither The Engine nor Backstage Capital are charities.", "You are not philanthropists, you are investors.", "And so you're investing in people and companies that you", "think will make a difference,", "but you're doing so to get returns.", "And we often see investors,", "especially in venture capital sidestepping,", "the kinds of founders and startups that you are interested", "in because they fear that they won't make money.", "I actually just saw this week,", "the global head of technology at Deutsche Bank was", "quoted saying,", "Rarely in my investment career do I see what's good for", "society is also good for investment returns.", "And so I wanted to ask each of you,", "what is wrong with that perspective?", "What have you seen through your funds that proves that maybe", "you actually can make money by investing in diversity,", "investing in social good,", "investing in tech that changes the world?", "One thing to note when it comes to venture is I think just", "in the last month or so they released", "someone released data.", "I think it was PitchBook or Crunchbase that said", "something like two thirds of all venture funds return one X", "or less over their seven to 10 year period.", "And so one way of framing it is that, you know,", "being safe so far is not really working.", "If for no other reason, getting outside of the, you know,", "color lines, no pun intended is interesting", "[mumbles]", "being competitive or who looks at trends or, you know,", "in the same way that people look at, you know,", "other trends like cryptocurrency and things like that,", "you know, take a, just to take an academic critical,", "look at it rather than dismissing it all in.", "And then of course, anecdotally,", "I'm surrounded by people, surround,", "absolutely surrounded by people in our portfolio,", "more than a hundred companies.", "So 250, 300 founders total who have been overlooked.", "And I believe good 20% of them will go on to either", "in this company or the next lead unicorn companies", "if they want to.", "They're creating impact now and we're talking about,", "what is it, 20?", "What is the 2030 or 2040?", "I don't know exactly right now,", "but at some point we're gonna be a majority minority.", "And so we're gonna have to speak to,", "we have to start now to speak to that audience.", "And it just the past 10 years,", "everything that black and brown people who have been paying", "attention have predicted has come true.", "And I think this year is like a combination of that.", "It's come to a head and to, to overlook it now is,", "is just at the investor's peril.", "And maybe one thing to add to that totally agree is that,", "you know, if you talk to people,", "the young people of today,", "just go out to the universities and, you know,", "people of every race, class, gender,", "what you hear so often is", "we want to do good.", "And so if you just follow the youth in what will be,", "they want to be on a mission that is good for our planet,", "good for other people,", "you're gonna make money by being aligned.", "I'm sorry.", "The youth always know.", "So you just sound old when you say that.", "Yeah.", "You know, when you say, Oh yeah,", "you can't make money by doing good.", "You're just old.", "Right. Retire", "I also want to That's how I feel about", "You also can't make money if we don't have a planet", "or a functioning society,", "or many of the other things that I think we are grappling", "with very much this year.", "And Katie, I know many of the companies", "that are in your portfolio are", "focused on future proofing in a very literal way where we're", "trying to build things that ensure that there is a future", "in which we can make money as investors.", "And actually I have an audience question for you, Katie,", "which is sort of on those lines,", "which is, how do you get policymakers", "to invest in low probability,", "high impact scenario preparation.", "So when we're thinking about risk and how important it is", "to invest in understanding those risks", "and preparing for them,", "how do you get policymakers to consider that as well?", "Well, you know,", "it's a great question and it's something we spend", "a lot of time on because you know,", "we don't have an educated Congress", "about science and technology.", "We only have three people", "in Congress with a science or technology degree.", "And they are woefully understaffed in their understanding of", "what's actually happening.", "And so,", "and not because they're not good people and wouldn't wanna", "set good policy for the future.", "I don't believe that at all.", "So that means that it's incumbent upon, you know,", "people with that knowledge to really work with the folks", "that will set policy.", "And so there's a quite a large group of people that do that,", "but it requires really education.", "I mean, look at climate change.", "We still have people negating that,", "okay so California's burning people.", "I mean that was a real wake up call.", "Look, go to Miami, look at all the basements", "they're flooded.", "The sea is rising.", "There's no way around not acknowledging that yet", "we still don't.", "So, you know, we all have to continue", "to educate those that will make policy,", "but we also on the venture capital side in the", "entrepreneurship and innovation side have", "to also show the way.", "What's the capital needed?", "Why is that capital needed?", "How do you establish these industries that will do good?", "And so you have to put forth and help the policy makers", "really see what's going on.", "It's not their fault that they don't know this deep science,", "you know,", "and so it's a collaboration that needs to happen.", "Yeah.", "And I love this idea of modeling that through your", "investments and through the work that you do.", "We just have a couple of minutes left,", "but I did wanna acknowledge that this year has been a huge", "wake up call for not just issues of disaster preparation,", "but also Arlan I know you're seeing just as of this year,", "a huge surge in interest around funding, diverse founders,", "black and brown founders in particular.", "And so I was wondering if you could sort of leave us with", "some thoughts about how we take this energy into the future", "and ensure that the founders and companies that are", "underrepresented right now are the ones that we're paying", "more attention to in the future.", "What have you seen from this year", "that may be be telling about how we", "get more money into the hands that need it going forward?", "Yeah I think, you know,", "this summer has just been very interesting.", "Phone has been ringing off the hook in a way that has,", "you know, we haven't changed, I haven't changed,", "but circumstances have.", "And to me it's not a cause for celebration.", "Obviously it's a very painful time, a traumatic time", "for so many people.", "And for me also time will tell, you know,", "this can't be a moment.", "It has to be a movement and it has to stand the test of time", "because already, I mean, even already there's been,", "I would say 40 to 60% drop off in the interest since June", "because people's attention span and stamina is just so", "lacking when it comes to anything that's uncomfortable or", "different or outside of their comfort zone.", "And the people who are still in the fight,", "the people that even large corporations,", "some of them have been able to stay in the fight.", "And really, you know, beyond the headlines", "and beyond the [mumbles] have really said,", "what do we do?", "And are learning from the people who have been in the", "trenches this whole time.", "And you know, it wasn't a wake up call by the way,", "to black people.", "This what you're referring to.", "It was not a wake up call to us.", "We've been woke for the entire time.", "So the people who were jolted awake really should", "stay awake, you know, do what it takes.", "I won't call out a energy drink.", "Cause I don't know who your sponsors are,", "but do what it takes or they can stay awake and make it a", "durable, sustainable part of the fabric", "of your companies and internally.", "And that's, you know, that starts internally too,", "with really looking at who you have on your teams,", "how you're representing yourselves outwardly,", "how are people who are looking for jobs,", "do they feel included based on what they see of your company", "so far?", "There's a lot that can be done.", "And there are so many people who already do this work,", "who you can tap into", "rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.", "I love that.",
