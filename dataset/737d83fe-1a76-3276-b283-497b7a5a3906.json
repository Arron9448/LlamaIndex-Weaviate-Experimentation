We didn\u2019t get our code until late yesterday afternoon, so I\u2019m still very much playing it. In the meantime, I figured I\u2019d give some early impressions of the game.", "So far I\u2019m enjoying Soulstorm, mainly because it immediately addresses my primary issue with both the original Abe\u2019s Oddysee and its remake, New 'n' Tasty!: the stiff platforming. Soulstorm feels far more fluid; Abe even has a double jump, which is good because Soulstorm kicks off with an intense, fast-paced platforming gauntlet. I love having the confidence to just run, grab, and climb platforms without having to think about the controls nearly as much. The game still has the same general control scheme, but I had far less issues performing basic actions like aiming and tossing items.", "I haven\u2019t had a chance to mess around with the new crafting system all that much. I have, however, become surprisingly engrossed with completing badges. These achievement tiers for completing actions like finding secret areas or collecting bottles aren\u2019t the most robust addition, but they add a fun little incentive for poking around levels more thoroughly. Getting around Sligs is still mostly fun, though it's occasionally a frustrating exercise of trial and error as you figure out the right way to sneak past, distract, or trap them. A meter that indicates their alert status helps a lot. Now, you know exactly how much you're triggering them and when they\u2019ll forget Abe and reset their patrols.", "I\u2019m playing on PS5, and the game looks perfectly fine in terms of graphical fidelity but don\u2019t expect it to knock you off your feet. That said, Oddworld\u2019s delightfully weird art direction shines through, and it\u2019s cool to see these familiar weirdos look even better than they did in New \u2018n\u2019 Tasty. I am disappointed with some of the load times. They aren\u2019t horrible but take long enough to feel like a drag given the platform I\u2019m playing on.", "More than anything, Oddworld: Soulstorm is definitely more of Abe\u2019s Oddysee with some improvements and additions that I\u2019m not sure are good or not just yet. I'm having a good time by and large, and look forward to seeing how it evolves. The game is available now and is a freebie on PS Plus for PS5, so if you\u2019re reading this, odds are you\u2019re knee-deep in it yourself. My review should be published later this week, but I\u2019d love to hear your impressions in the comments!"], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "Marcus Is An Avid Gamer", "Giant Wrestling Nerd", "A Connoisseur Of Cartoons", "Obscure Childhood References.
