With their long, Dale Chihuly-ish tendrils, the plants of the genus Tillandsia make a lovely, if peculiar, addition to a shelf of trinkets. Perfect for an age that prizes minimalism, they don\u2019t need anything so fussy as soil in order to thrive\u2014they are breatharians, existing on water and sunlight alone. Their spindly leaves are dotted with fuzzy little nubs called trichomes, which absorb moisture, and, given their ascetic transcendence of nutrients, that\u2019s practically all they need. In nature, they\u2019re found on trees. Politely, they do not steal their hosts\u2019 sustenance but simply hold gently onto their bark to position themselves in a comfortable spot. In homes, they\u2019re ideal for the inattentive plant dabbler, requiring only a weekly soak. (The only thing to watch out for is how easy it is to forget that such an independent object has needs at all.) Combining quirkiness with austerity, they satisfy both the aesthetics and the pragmatism of an age in which there\u2019s a premium on high-impact, photogenic natural d\u00e9cor that doesn\u2019t take too much precious time or space-devouring materials to maintain.", "A new installment of The New Yorker\u2019s Annals of Obsession video series features two horticulturalists, Pamela Koide-Hyatt and Josh Rosen, who have devoted much of their lives to studying and cultivating air plants. \u201cIt\u2019s got thick leaves, so it\u2019ll handle lots of abuse,\u201d Koide-Hyatt explains, holding up a small mitlaensis-bulbosa hybrid. \u201cYou could probably go six months without watering it.\u201d But she warns that the glass globes air plants are commonly displayed in are not their ideal environment: she calls them crematoriums, because they concentrate sunlight and heat, and she has seen air plants turned into \u201ccrispy critters\u201d inside them. She speaks about the plants with the reverence and affection of an infatuated spouse. In 1981, she says, she started driving down to Mexico regularly to gather as many Tillandsias as she could find, bringing them back to her plant nursery for propagation. Since then, her enthusiasm has only deepened, and she has created a number of dazzling hybrids.", "Rosen, who seems equally captivated by the plants, has his own advice about how to avoid killing them. He explains that, though air plants are tempting to touch, especially the fuzzier varieties, the oil on our skin is not good for them. Their particular style of finickiness, it seems, lies not in how much attention they need but in the many things that should not be done to them. Still, if left properly alone, they can survive nearly anywhere, from a Pinterest-inspired wall-hanging to a wide array of natural landscapes. Discussing the fact that they can live at sea level or at high elevation, in deserts or in different kinds of forests, Rosen wistfully compares their adaptability to the migration patterns of modern humans: \u201cWe live everywhere, and we kind of create our own habitat, and our own homes.\u201d For anyone who has ever packed everything into a U-Haul or struggled to achieve life-changing-magic levels of tidying up, there\u2019s something enviable about these organisms\u2019 ability to set up a home anywhere that they can hang their trichomes."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/video-dept/the-alien-minimalism-of-air-plants", "id": "a008f977-38ea-3bb7-a3a1-a491405206dc", "title": "The Alien Minimalism of Air Plants", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Crispin Long", "Charlotte Mendelson", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins"], "summary": "Of all the strange and Instagram-friendly plants that have become popular in the past several years, from hardy succulents to giant-leafed Monsteras, air plants may be the most alien-like.\nA new installment of The New Yorker\u2019s Annals of Obsession video series features two horticulturalists, Pamela Koide-Hyatt and Josh Rosen, who have devoted much of their lives to studying and cultivating air plants.\n\u201cYou could probably go six months without watering it.\u201d But she warns that the glass globes air plants are commonly displayed in are not their ideal environment: she calls them crematoriums, because they concentrate sunlight and heat, and she has seen air plants turned into \u201ccrispy critters\u201d inside them.\nRosen, who seems equally captivated by the plants, has his own advice about how to avoid killing them.\nHe explains that, though air plants are tempting to touch, especially the fuzzier varieties, the oil on our skin is not good for them.", "pubDate": null}
