That means developers don\u2019t need to worry about how much storage and computing power they will need as they focus on writing code. Infrastructure is adjusted automatically.", "The technology \u201cis reducing capital costs and shifting the focus to customers\u2019 needs instead of setting up, configuring, patching and maintaining servers in the data center,\u201d according to Nasdaq\u2019s 2020 Tech Trends report released Thursday. \u201cThe cloud provider takes care of the scale and security, making the infrastructure essentially invisible,\u201d according to the report, to which Mr. Peterson contributed.", "Brad Peterson, Nasdaq's chief technology and information officer.

Rowe Price Group Inc., told CIO Journal.", "Another technology highlighted in the Nasdaq report is an open-source platform called Apache Kafka that has become a popular way to share real-time market data.", "Mr. Peterson said Kafka, which is managed by the Apache Software Foundation, has recently gained steam in the financial-markets sector. It was created in 2011 by LinkedIn as an internal application, but is used today to either publish data streams or subscribe to them in real time. One benefit, according to the report, is that it has made it easier for market participants to take huge volumes of trading data and stream it in real time through client portals.", "\u201cBetween cloud, the [application-programming-interface] movement and Kafka,\u201d Mr. Peterson said, \u201cyou have the foundational components to really make this concept of markets more cost-effective and more easy to incorporate.\u201d", "Other technology trends cited by Nasdaq\u2019s report include artificial intelligence; low code-no code tools, where users can build applications by dragging and dropping components; and machine-to-machine communication, which \u201cgives businesses the ability to ingest and compute large volumes of data in real time, so they can perform functions and scale quickly.\u201d", "Write to Jared Council at jared.council@wsj.com"], "authors": ["Jared Council"], "keywords": ["technology", "peterson", "tech", "cloud", "data", "nasdaq", "real", "computing", "report", "mr", "trends", "serverless", "sees", "cio", "2020", "trend", "infrastructure"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e"}
