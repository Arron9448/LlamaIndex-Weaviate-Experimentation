Leaving aside the questions raised by early attempts at marketing Dickinson as a children\u2019s writer, it seems certain that her own youthful reading in the genre remained a significant, deeply absorbed element in her mature technique.", "This week\u2019s poem (written in 1865) hints at a particular subdivision of the genre, and, three lines before the end, even plants a kind of clue: \u201cFurther than Riddle [can] ride.\u201d The poem is a riddle, of sorts. It seems at first glance almost to have been crafted to entertain and keep a bright young reader guessing. There\u2019s a degree of playful teasing in the opening line, effected by the repetition of \u201cunder\u201d (\u201cUnder the Light, yet under.\u201d) This is a bit like saying \u201cyou\u2019re getting warm\u201d when a player is on the right track in a guessing game, but needs to go farther. In the alliterative devices of the last stanza, though, the poem is also a reminder of the Old English riddle, not at all a children\u2019s genre. Technically and imaginatively, Dickinson will always transcend categories.", "This \u201criddle\u201d is one that is designed to \u201cride\u201d consistently beyond itself. Its aim is multi-directional and vastly long-distance, but the \u201canswer\u201d is a condition wholly unreachable. The reader\u2019s mind is led \u201cunder\u201d, \u201cfurther\u201d, \u201cover\u201d and \u201cfurther\u201d again. The five repetitions (of \u201cunder\u201d) in the first stanza are unique. They set the scene on earth, and almost immediately push beneath it, with typically close-seen natural images, uniting those particularly associated with the graveyard (\u201cthe Grass and the Dirt\u201d) with suggestions of nourishment and vitality (\u201cthe Beetle\u2019s Cellar\u201d, \u201cthe Clover\u2019s Root\u201d).", "The mystery intensifies. Now the direction of the first stanza is reversed and we\u2019re urged to look \u201cover the Light\u201d. This is the point where the light becomes metaphysical. We were not meant to be detained by the lovely image of extended sunlight in the last line of stanza two.", "Dickinson springs her best surprises in the third stanza. The \u201cComet\u2019s chimney\u201d very likely refers to the Great Comet of 1823, also designated C/1823 Y1 or Comet De Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Pons. Jean-Louis Pons had believed when he first observed the phenomenon that he was seeing smoke from a chimney. Only the smoke\u2019s failure to move alerted him to his mistake. It was a bright comet with two \u201ctails\u201d, visible during the last month of 1823 and the first months of 1824.", "The image of the \u201cCubit\u2019s Head\u201d is more obscure. The biblical cubit was only the length of a forearm, after all. But perhaps the owner of the forearm was King Og, the giant who was slain by Moses, and, according to the Talmud, could have destroyed Israel by overturning a mountain. He sets a different standard for cubits, and for giant\u2019s bedsteads. Dickinson\u2019s second stanza includes a giant, and might have led her to further thoughts about Og and the head of his vast bed.", "The poem that\u2019s so much more than a riddle gives up its subject indirectly, with an interjection of intense longing: \u201cOh for a Disc to the Distance / Between Ourselves and the Dead!\u201d The \u201cdisc\u201d (from the Latin diskos, meaning a quoit) might suggest a circular-shaped planet or star that could at least be seen from the Earth, if not visited, or simply, playfully, a \u201cdiscus\u201d that could be thrown into the hands of those no longer on the Earth. It might also suggest a coin or key-like device, which would open an imagined lock. The speaker seems to ask for something utterly simple and hugely complex at the same time. It\u2019s a characteristic combination of qualities, belonging to much of her most vital work. There are many poets contained in a single Dickinson poem, and many ages \u2013 in all senses of the word."], "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "keywords": ["riddle", "giant", "week", "ride", "earth", "poem", "dickinson", "emily", "disc", "genre", "stanza", "light"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
