One of Sund\u2019s officers died during the assault by a pro-Trump mob.", "In an interview with the Washington Post, Sund claimed the House of Representatives\u2019 sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, said he was not comfortable with the \u201coptics\u201d of declaring an emergency ahead of the demonstration, while the sergeant-at-arms at the Senate, Michael Stenger, suggested he should only informally seek for the national guard to be put on standby.", "Irving and Stenger, who also resigned over last week\u2019s attack, have not commented on Sund\u2019s allegations.", "Claiming he sought assistance on some dozen occasions both in the run-up to the rally and in the midst of the rioting, Sund told the paper: \u201cIf we would have had the national guard [available] we could have held them at bay longer, until more officers from our partner agencies could arrive,\u201d he said.", "Describing the delays in deploying the national guard as the mob pushed past Sund\u2019s officers to enter the Capitol as Congress was sitting to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory in November\u2019s presidential election, Sund said he joined a 2.26pm conference call with the Pentagon to plead for help, but once again received pushback because of the perceived \u201coptics\u201d of deploying the national guard.", "\u201cI am making an urgent, urgent immediate request for national guard assistance,\u201d Sund said. \u201cI have got to get boots on the ground.\u201d", "Among those pushing back, according to Sund, was Gen Walter E Piatt, the director of the army staff, who Sund said did not like the potential \u201cvisual\u201d of the national guard standing in a line with the Capitol in the background. The guard was eventually deployed by the acting defence secretary, Christopher Miller, at 3.04pm.", "Maxine Waters, a Democratic member of the House from California, said in an interview with Associated Press that the Capitol police \u201cwere left naked\u201d. She said she had raised security concerns in a 28 December meeting of House Democrats and grilled Sund during an hour-long private call on New Year\u2019s Eve.", "\u201cIt turns out it was the worst kind of non-security anybody could ever imagine. He kept assuring me he had it under control \u2013 they knew what they were doing,\u201d she said.", "Sund also warned of potential violence ahead of Biden\u2019s inauguration on 20 January, adding to a growing number of voices, including Twitter\u2019s late last week as it banned Trump from the site, that fresh plots were circulating on social media.", "\u201cMy concern is if they don\u2019t get their act together with physical security, it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d he said.", "The Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, has asked the Department of Homeland Security to accelerate its security plan for Biden\u2019s swearing in and bring its measures into force from Monday.", "\u201cWe believe strongly that the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20 will require a very different approach than previous inaugurations given the chaos, injury, and death experienced at the United States Capitol during the insurrection,\u201d said Bowser, asking for a \u201cpre-disaster declaration\u201d to allow for federal assistance.", "The request came amid widespread reports of far-right and other groups discussing plans to target the inauguration, including discussing the use of violence, on sites such as Parler that have become popular with pro-Trump extremists.", "\u201cWe took the building once,\u201d one person said. \u201cWe can take it again.\u201d", "Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and former army ranger, said on Sunday he had spoken with military officials who were aware of \u201cpossible threats posed by would-be terrorists\u201d in the period leading up to the inauguration.", ""], "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "keywords": ["guard", "inauguration", "exhead", "potential", "officers", "national", "reluctant", "security", "violence", "capitol", "officials", "sunds", "sund"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
