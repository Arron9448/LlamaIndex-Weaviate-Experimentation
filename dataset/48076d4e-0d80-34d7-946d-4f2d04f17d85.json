Lesser-known platforms that have supported extremists and conspiracy theorists for years were also activated by the insurrection. Among them is a blockchain-based livestreaming site called DLive, which hosted multiple streams from the Capitol on Wednesday and allowed viewers to donate directly to the streamers as they broadcast their actions and misinformation.", "Channels with hundreds of viewers went live on Wednesday with titles like \u201cMarch to Save America,\u201d and \u201cTime to Take Our Country Back.\u201d More than 140,000 DLive viewers watched streams about the events at the Capitol, many condoning or encouraging the mob there. At least one person streamed after breaking into the Capitol itself as donations flooded in.", "DLive was founded by entrepreneur Charles Wayn in 2017 as a lower-scale competitor to Amazon\u2019s Twitch. The platform broke into the mainstream when YouTube\u2019s top gaming celebrity, Felix \u201cPewDiePie\u201d Kjellberg, streamed there exclusively for a brief period starting in 2019. Since then the site has kept growing, from the 4,322nd-ranked site according to Alexa in October to 3,273rd today.", "A major contributor to DLive\u2019s growth has been the white nationalist leaders and other far-right personalities who fled there after bans on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and elsewhere. On DLive, however, they\u2019ve been able to cultivate enormous audiences thanks to the platform\u2019s lenient, hands-off moderation. Dozens of prominent extremists and conspiracy theorists stream on the site, many under \u201cVerified Partner\u201d badges. They\u2019re also able to earn money there, via DLive\u2019s in-app currency, Lemon, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars, according to data shared with WIRED by a livestreaming analyst. In August, Time reported that eight of the top 10 earners were extremists or conspiracy theorists.", "One streamer who received donations as he stormed the Capitol on Wednesday was Tim Gionet, also known as BakedAlaska. Gionet was banned from Twitter in 2017; YouTube removed his channel in October after he harassed retail workers over wearing masks. On Wednesday he streamed on DLive for over 20 minutes from inside the Capitol, reaching an audience of over 17,000 at its peak. \u201cThank you everyone for sharing this video,\u201d he said at one point, before encouraging the mob around him to start an \u201cAmerica first\u201d chant. Online viewers in his livestream joined in the chatroom, asking him to \u201cSMASH THE WINDOW\u201d or \u201cHANG ALL THE CONGRESSMEN.\u201d They also rewarded him with donations. Elon University professor Megan Squire, an expert on online extremism, estimates that fans donated thousands of dollars to him yesterday through lemons.", "In another Dlive streamer\u2019s video from DC, the person points the camera at a line of cop cars and says, \u201cI was waiting for some content. I tried to get back to the Capitol for you boys, but it\u2019s not possible. So this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d", "In a livestream today, DLive\u2019s head of community addressed yesterday\u2019s events: \u201cI do want to make it incredibly, incredibly clear that DLive does not condone any illegal activity. Peaceful protests? Fine. Reporting on the protests? Fine. But if your channel or you the streamer are involved in any illegal activity, your channel will be taken offline.\u201d A representative for DLive did not return a request for comment from WIRED. StreamElements, which helped facilitate the DLive donations to Gionet, today removed his account, telling WIRED he violated their terms of service."], "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Cecilia D'Anastasi"], "keywords": ["viewers", "haven", "dlive", "capitol", "site", "gionet", "game", "platforms", "extremist", "donations", "extremists", "streamed", "livestreaming", "wired"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
