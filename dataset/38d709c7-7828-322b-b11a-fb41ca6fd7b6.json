They include 24-year-old Vanessa Nakate, a prominent member of the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda, and founder of The Rise Up Climate Movement, which is working to amplify the voices of activists in Africa.", "Here, she describes how countries such as hers are already facing the brunt of the climate emergency and the ambitious action she hopes to see in the year ahead.", "\u201cIn 2021, I want our world leaders to treat the climate crisis like a crisis. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen in the future, it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s already affecting millions of lives around the world. We need drastic action now.", "An elderly woman washes her belongings in the mud after the area was hit by Cyclone Idai in Chimanimani, Zimbabwe, March 19th, 2019.

We\u2019ve had severe droughts, floods, and storms, which are getting worse as a result of climate change. In 2019, Cyclone Idai\u2014the worst cyclone to ever hit the continent\u2014caused destruction and flooding in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, leaving more than 1,300 people dead and many more missing.", "\u201cHistorically, Africa has only contributed 3% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Countries in the global south are suffering the most as a result of climate change, but have contributed the least. And it\u2019s people of color that are the least listened-to in the climate movement. I\u2019ve experienced this on a personal level, when I was cropped out of a photograph of climate activists in January 2020. There is so much environmental racism that people need to understand.", "\u201cThis year, a crucial UN Climate Conference, COP 26, is taking place in Glasgow. I want to see real ambition from world leaders in cutting CO2 emissions now\u2014not in 20 or 30 years. We don\u2019t have any time left. We need to stop digging up and burning fossil fuels and invest in clean technologies. We need to recognize the importance of our ecosystems, including our forests and oceans, as they are vital for our existence.", "Climate activist Vanessa Nakate, Luisa Neubauer, Greta Thunberg, Isabelle Axelsson and Loukina Tille arrive for a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, January 24th, 2020.

According to Project Drawdown, educating girls and young women is the sixth most powerful climate solution we have. As women are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, educating girls equips them with the tools they need to address the environmental challenges they\u2019re facing", "\u201cWe need to get behind solutions that we know will work and that will work right now. We can all do something; we can rewrite the story. I\u2019m optimistic about 2021. My hope lies in the millions of young people who are speaking up and demanding action.
