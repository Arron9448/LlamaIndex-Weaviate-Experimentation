Either he would tweet something beyond the pale even for him\u2014an explicit death threat, say\u2014or he would leave the White House and stop benefiting from Twitter\u2019s lenient rules for public figures.", "Neither scenario is how Trump\u2019s Twitter career finally came to an apparent end. On Friday night, with just 12 days left in his presidency and two days after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol, leading to several deaths, Twitter said it had permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account \u201cdue to the risk of further incitement of violence.\u201d The pair of tweets that did him in, however, wouldn't even crack his thousand most egregious:", "\u201cThe 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future.

Hours into the siege of the Capitol, Trump released a short video telling the rioters to \u201cgo home.\u201d But in the video, he also repeated the false claim motivating the riot, namely that the election had been stolen from him. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter all took the post down. In their eyes, the video was more likely to cause violence than quell it. By Thursday, both Facebook and Twitter had frozen Trump\u2019s accounts\u2014finally taking the dramatic step they had avoided throughout his presidency.", "As I wrote on Thursday, the striking thing about the account suspensions was that Trump had really not crossed any new line; as outrageous as his message was, he at least told his followers to stand down. The rest was just classic Trump. Falsely claiming election fraud and praising even his most despicable followers is simply what the man does, and has done for the past four-odd years. What changed, then, was not Trump\u2019s behavior on the platforms but rather the facts on the ground: With the Capitol ransacked and blood spilled, the hypothesis that Trump\u2019s language could incite violence had been replaced by the straightforward fact that it had."], "authors": ["Gilad Edelman", "Gilad Edelma"], "keywords": ["great", "banned", "trumps", "capitol", "followers", "far", "worst", "twitter", "facebook", "video", "violence", "tweets", "trump"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
