J. Liebling\u2019s column on the royal wedding captures a joyful moment during Britain\u2019s postwar recovery. Photograph by Bert Hardy / Getty", "Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, died on Friday, at the age of ninety-nine, a solemn moment in a tumultuous era in British royal history. Four years older than The New Yorker, the Prince made one of his first appearances in the magazine in 1947, a period when its pages were often occupied not only with the aftermath of the war but with the activities of aristocracy both foreign and domestic: the Astors, the Rockefellers, and, especially, the British Royal Family. The occasion for the article was Philip\u2019s wedding to young Princess Elizabeth, and all its attendant media coverage, which A. J. Liebling reviewed under the rubric The Wayward Press. Liebling\u2019s media column, which ran for several decades, was often as acidic as it was enthusiastic, and the royal-wedding roundup is a particular pleasure to revisit. Liebling\u2019s report brims with details that somehow didn\u2019t make it into \u201cThe Crown\u201d: No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s seating assignment during the ceremony; a bust of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visible behind the Duke\u2019s head as he entered Westminster Abbey; and, for the newlyweds\u2019 protection, the presence of a Scotland Yard agent, on a makeshift bed, in an attic above the room where they spent their wedding night. (Across the pond, Liebling\u2019s employer, Harold Ross, would soon be invited to a dinner with the former King Edward VIII and his wife, Wallis Simpson, who turned out to be fans of The New Yorker\u2019s coverage of his abdication.)", "Liebling\u2019s wedding column captures a rare joyful moment during Britain\u2019s difficult postwar recovery, but the reporter still gets his zingers in. Correspondents offering tremulous coverage are \u201cdealers in radiance\u201d; Liebling cites a quotation, in the Post, of a \u201cstarry-eyed Cockney girl\u201d who says, of the future Queen\u2019s consort, \u201cGord, but ain\u2019t \u2019e the \u2019andsome one.\u201d (Liebling joked that he had pored over so many British reports that week that he was seeing spots\u2014the result of \u201cdropped \u2018h\u2019s.\u201d) And for a final word in class-based commentary he turns to no less an authority than the Daily Worker, which pointedly noted, in a headline, \u201c18 COUPLES WED QUIETLY AT CITY HALL, NON-ROYAL LOVERS UNITED IN SIMPLE RITES.\u201d", "More from the Archive Sign up for Classics, a twice-weekly newsletter featuring notable pieces from the past.", "Having run through press accounts of weddings both royal and common, Liebling ends the column by turning his gaze across the English Channel\u2014where, according to the Herald Tribune, \u201cthe Count of Paris, the Pretender to the French throne,\u201d had finally renounced his claims. He no longer believed, Liebling reports, that there was any kind of future in \u201cthe king business.\u201d"], "authors": ["Erin Overbey", "Erin Overbe", "Rebecca Mea", "Robin Wrigh"], "keywords": ["moment", "prince", "british", "lieblings", "wedding", "royal", "column", "elizabeth", "reports", "yorker", "philip", "recovery", "liebling", "queen", "coverage"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
