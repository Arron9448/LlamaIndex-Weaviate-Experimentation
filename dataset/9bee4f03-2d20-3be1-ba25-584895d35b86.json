The previous week, I went about my normal life, albeit with a headache and a bruised face, in the city that afforded me anonymity. But the sensationalised coverage of the \u201cLondon bus attack\u201d warped last summer into a dystopian, invasive episode.", "Do these homophobic attacks mean we\u2019ll again have to hide our same-sex relationships? | Amelia Abraham Read more", "It is hard to convey the loss of autonomy and agency from being the unwilling subject of a photo that goes viral. Never having sought publicity, I was suddenly everywhere, reduced to a \u201clesbian on the bus\u201d (the media continues to misidentify me as such; I\u2019m bisexual) after Melania and I were photographed as the victims of a homophobic attack. Following the trajectory of viral stories, the headlines disappeared abruptly, but we were pursued for months by politicians, reporters, celebrities, and businesses who thought we could benefit their brands and bottom lines. Then the wait began for the trial of our attackers to drag the episode back into the headlines, but by November, I was ready, and stronger.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The CCTV footage shows the aggressive targeting of people for their identity.\u2019 Images show the attack on Melania Geymonat and Christine Hannigan on a London bus on 30 May. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA", "The media distorted and exploited our story rather than focusing on marginalised hate crime victims who suffer far more than broken noses. There were bright spots, though, borne of Melania\u2019s sharing and openness. Friends and strangers told us that previously intolerant relatives\u2019 hearts had softened as a result of our story, and that the incident forced them to confront their own traumas. We connected with important organisations: Citizens UK is lobbying the Law Commission to classify \u200bmisogyny\u200b as a hate crime and to make \u200bhate crime reporting\u200b intersectional. \u200b#WeAreTheBlackCap\u200b is a grassroots campaign that\u2019s been workingfor nearly five years to reopen the historic gay bar and LGBTQ+ performance venue, The Black Cap, in Camden, rather than see it converted into more unaffordable luxury flats plaguing London. The Anne Frank Trust equips young people with the knowledge, skill and confidence to challenge prejudice and discrimination.", "I might have found myself propelled on to a platform I neither wanted nor felt qualified to stand on, but I have accepted that the attack conferred some responsibility on me. In the autumn, I read Audre Lorde\u2019s 1981essay The Uses of Anger: Responding to Racism, which insists anger must be mobilised into a collective labour of love to fight systematic and interconnected injustice and oppression. You cannot be outraged by homophobia but indifferent to racism; supportive of disabled rights but not those of migrants; feminist but transphobic.", "Speaking of potential collaboration between black and white women to fight racism, Lorde writes \u201cwe have been raised to view any difference other than sex as a reason for destruction ... to face each other\u2019s angers without denial or immobility or silence or guilt is in itself a heretical and generative idea. It implies peers meeting upon a common basis to examine difference, and to alter those distortions which history has created around our difference. For it is those distortions which separate us. And we must ask ourselves: Who profits from all this?\u201d", "In court, I saw the CCTV footage for the first time of the encounter on the bus. The boys corner us, looming and jeering, while Melania tries to deflect, as we often do in those scary situations. After a few minutes, I walk directly back to the boy throwing coins and a brawl erupts. The footage shows the aggressive targeting of people for their identity, and what it looks like when you\u2019ve had enough of it. Squaring up to five teenage males was obviously not the most judicious recourse, but I will not back down from the simple sentiment: stand up for each other, and fight back.", "Lorde\u2019s words now motivate me in the face of that incident in the summer \u2013 and the recent election result. The UK reinstated a party that exploits differences in service of enriching themselves, destroying the planet, and keeping their foot on the necks of anyone who is not a rich, white, able-bodied straight man. \u201cAnger expressed and translated into action in the service of our vision and our future is a liberating and strengthening act of clarification, for it is in the painful process of this translation that we identify who are our allies with whom we have grave differences, and who are our genuine enemies.\u201d", "\u2022 Christine Hannigan is from the US and based in London, where she researches the privatisation of urban infrastructure and spaces"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["christine", "attack", "london", "difference", "face", "hate", "footage", "victims", "fight", "anger", "racism", "bus", "melania", "force", "hannigan", "crime", "good"], "id": "9bee4f03-2d20-3be1-ba25-584895d35b86", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Christine Hannigan"], "title": "We victims of hate crime can use anger as a force for good | Christine Hannigan"}
