That\u2019s what I told myself until a couple of weeks ago, when I again found myself parting the great, tangled seafloor of ethernet cables to vacuum my office.", "Whereas wireless connectivity is the norm for movie buffs and even audiophiles these days, gamers have made life difficult for ourselves. We\u2019ve named latency as our enemy. So we\u2019re still snaking our three HDMIs up from our three consoles to our televisions, still winding three ethernet cables from our modems to those three consoles. And, of course, we\u2019re still plugging those three consoles into the wall. After a year staying home and accumulating both gaming gear and office equipment, my floor looks like the bottom of Strega Nona\u2019s pasta pot.", "There are fixes, of course.

If you can\u2019t differentiate your floor from your local forest\u2019s, it\u2019s likely because your cables are too long.", "Photograph: Cecilia D'Anastasio", "If you have the funds, consider new cables. Measure your cables\u2019 pathway around a room and add an extra eight inches\u2014better slightly too long than too short. Purchasing high-quality cables with minimal slack will cut down on the likelihood of having to rewire in the future. And as it can be annoying to switch out cables when they\u2019re hidden behind a wall-mounted cable raceway, swing for a durable, premium high-speed HDMI, which you probably want anyway for your Xbox One X or PlayStation 5. Cable quality matters in the long run.", "Cable Management Equipment", "What you will need depends on your setup. If your PC lives on top of your desk, for example, you might want to mount a surge protector to the bottom of your desk so only one cable gets plugged into the wall. If your television is wall-mounted, and you hate those dangling HDMI cables running up from your Nintendo Switch, you might want to get some paint to match the cable raceway color to your wall\u2019s."], "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Cecilia D'Anastasi"], "keywords": ["floor", "consoles", "gamers", "desk", "management", "cables", "guide", "wallmounted", "wall", "cable", "walls", "lazy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
