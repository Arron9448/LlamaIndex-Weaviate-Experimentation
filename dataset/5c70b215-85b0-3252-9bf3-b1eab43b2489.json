The first big patch is scheduled to arrive sometime next week and will address a variety of problems, such as game crashes and matchmaking. You can read the full patch notes here.

Soon, you too can be frustrated both in-game and in real life.", "People Can Fly says the contents of the appreciation package are subject to change based on its technical feasibility. There\u2019s no timetable on when eligible players will receive it.", "Outriders\u2019 problems are unfortunate because when it does work, it\u2019s a pretty fun time. Our own Liana Ruppert scored the game a 9 out of 10 saying in her review: \u201cOutriders isn\u2019t revolutionary, and it\u2019s not trying to be. Outriders is a well-thought-out shooter with expertly tailored RPG twists. It's an enjoyable ride that is made infinitely better by playing with friends, but not inherently hurt by running solo either. This game takes the best parts from other looter-shooters and the best aspects of sci-fi RPGs and blends these elements into an experience that is worth diving into because of its high replayability, customizable play style, and fun story. I'm already strapping in for another run.\u201d", "Are you enjoying Outriders, and how many issues have you encountered since playing?
