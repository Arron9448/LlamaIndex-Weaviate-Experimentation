Christle\u2019s background as a poet informs her use of pattern and juxtaposition to generate meaning from her wide-ranging research, and the result is a thoughtful, often moving rumination on the expression of emotions beyond the reach of language.", "The Story of a Goat, by Perumal Murugan, translated from the Tamil by N.
