Four prospective Republican presidential candidates have joined the show at timely moments \u2013 Ted Cruz came on around the time he was embroiled in a scandal over a trip to Canc\u00fan while Texas suffered a power crisis.", "Many of the host interviews have broken news which resulted in Ruthless being cited by the Washington Post, the Hill, CNN, the Wall Street Journal and Politico. They have lined up a queue of more guests, including likely 2024 presidential candidates in the coming weeks.", "This is not a podcast for liberals Democrats looking for comfort. Nor is it a venue for anti-Trump Republicans or media types looking for praise.", "The hosts love to ding establishment media outlets and prominent reporters and they revel in bashing leaders of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project and energetically cheer when Democratic officials suffer misfortune.", "There are other more widely listened to conservative podcasts but Ruthless is the only one whose emergence so closely resembles the ones at the left that young activists and voters love.", "Ruthless\u2019s emergence comes at a time when Republicans are back in the political wilderness having lost control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. There\u2019s an ongoing question of what exactly the Republican party stands for and who its actual leaders are. Longtime Republican media figures are gone as well \u2013 Rush Limbaugh is dead and the more reliable broadcast journalists like Shepard Smith have left Fox News.", "Enter two Republican consultants and a popular antagonistic Twitter user.", "They saw an opening for a podcast that wasn\u2019t hosted by bowtie-wearing thinktank conservatives who want to recite the Federalist Papers or pontificate on Edmund Burke and William F Buckley. The 51st episode of the show on 1 April started out with Smug reading the papers and then joining the two other hosts saying April fools.", "\u201cYou get a yelling Federalist Papers brief on the conservative side or a rant about what\u2019s happening at the border, but you don\u2019t get a lot of attention to things that actually matter now. HR 1 is not something you can find on Fox prime time,\u201d Holmes said, referring to Democrats\u2019 voting rights bill.", "Senator Ted Cruz let bygones be bygones to appear with Josh Holmes on the Ruthless podcast. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP", "Ruthless wants to host a range of Republicans within the party, even when they don\u2019t necessarily see eye to eye.", "\u201cThe party\u2019s still a really big tent. And there are people that resonate with whole different segments,\u201d Holmes said in an interview. \u201cAt least me personally I don\u2019t think it makes any sense to get pigeonholed into one sect of the party. I think it makes a ton of sense to have a range of voices come in to make their pitch. Because ultimately what those interviews are all about are not litmus test questions about where you stand and the five things that voters care about, it\u2019s your personality. That\u2019s the only thing we aim to get out of it. It\u2019s your personality.\u201d", "Years ago Holmes and Cruz were on opposite sides of a vicious intra-party Republican civil war. In 2021 they found themselves in a Republican-friendly podcast.", "\u201cIf we were to jump into say a hot tub time machine and go back to 2013 and you were to tell the 2013 Josh Holmes \u2018you\u2019re going to be asking Ted Cruz to go on your podcast\u2019 what would you say to that?\u201d Cruz asked in one episode.", "\u201cI would\u2019ve strangled him to death,\u201d Holmes said, chuckling.", "They say an ardently anti-Trump Republican politician is welcome on the program as well as ones who have defended him \u2013 like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.", "For Republicans, Ruthless is trying to offer the same partisan content that popular political podcasts or comedic TV shows have done for independents and Democrats for years \u2013 something the right always struggled to offer. For everyone else, the show is a window into part of the pugnacious base \u2013 not the fringe right or the anti-Trump sects. They aren\u2019t always defending Donald Trump but they aren\u2019t regular critics of him or his supporters either.", "The controversial Georgia voting law has been a popular subject recently and the Ruthless hosts have been outspoken defenders of it, arguing that it actually expands secure voting rather than limiting it or that it is intended to hinder voting among Black voters. They have warned about the consequences of passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 and usually refer to it by its more opaque legislative moniker \u201cSR1\u201d or \u201cHR1\u201d. They say Washington DC statehood is a nefarious attempt by Democrats to cheat the system to gain more Senate seats.", "They are particularly proud of a special episode in which they did a dramatic reading of an Axios story on one of the most unusual and heated meetings of the Trump presidency.", "The Ruthless hosts are not sympathetic to the QAnon conspiracy movement or Trump amping up his supporters to storm the Capitol. The episode before the 6 January mob riot, was titled A Serious Talk and a big chunk of it was devoted to how Trump did indeed lose the election. Two days after the attack on the Capitol the hosts produced an episode titled Nobody\u2019s Happy.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a difference of opinion about what happened with the storming of the Capitol yesterday. I\u2019m just going to say flat out from my standpoint it was terrible,\u201d Holmes said in that episode. \u201cIt\u2019s unhelpful. It was embarrassing to conservatives, to Republicans, to the country, to basically everything. I felt like it was a really serious moment.\u201d", "Again, though, these are not the Republicans who want a massive overhaul of the party. They are the ones who see the Lincoln Project Republicans as equally fair game as Democrats.", "\u201cI know we give the Lincoln Project people a lot of shit on this podcast, but the oldest grift in politics is a Republican who hates on other Republicans on cable news,\u201d Duncan said in one episode. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s permanent employment.\u201d"], "authors": ["Daniel Strauss"], "keywords": ["ruthless", "cool", "podcast", "cruz", "republicans", "republican", "hosts", "episode", "voting", "holmes", "shot", "taking", "say", "conservatism", "making"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
