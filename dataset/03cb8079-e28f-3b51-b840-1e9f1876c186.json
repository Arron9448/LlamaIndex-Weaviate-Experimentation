The 93rd Oscars on April 25 will end this year\u2019s awards season on a high note. Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars are expected to hit a physical red carpet in their most dramatic looks, since stylists often keep their best gowns for last (an official formal dress code was even put into place this year, meaning no glamorous PJs). In honor of the grand upcoming event, Vogue is looking back at some of the very best Oscar dresses of all time.", "Selected by our editors (past and present), this definitive list of our top Oscar fashion moments revisits many iconic looks. A crowd favorite was Janelle Mon\u00e1e in a caped Ralph Lauren dress last year, as well as Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s sky-blue Prada gown from 2014, when the actress was nominated for 12 Years a Slave. Another standout was Nicole Kidman\u2019s unexpected Balenciaga halter dress with a dramatic bow detail, which she wore in 2007. And who could forget Charlize Theron\u2019s glittering Gucci gown from 2004, when she accepted Best Actress for Monster looking the part of a true Hollywood star?", "Many picks are some of the Oscars\u2019s more unexpected style moments, too: C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s backwards Christian Dior tuxedo, Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Marjan Pejoski swan dress, and Cameron Diaz\u2019s slightly boho dress by Emanuel Ungaro Couture, among others. As for throwback hits, Barbra Streisand\u2019s sheer jumpsuit by Arnold Scaasi, worn in 1969, is proof that having fun on the carpet always wins, as does Salma Hayek\u2019s Armani look in 1997, complete with a tiara.", "See these and more of Vogue\u2019s votes for the best Oscars dresses below."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["red", "looking", "best", "dresses", "looks", "oscar", "carpet", "dress", "48", "moments", "unexpected", "oscars"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
