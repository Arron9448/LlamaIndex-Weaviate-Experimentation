The feminist movement at the time still tended to treat lesbians as an albatross, an unsavory faction that undermined the movement\u2019s credibility. The Furies and other lesbian feminists sought to turn this logic inside out: What could be more quintessentially feminist than women loving other women? One Furies member, Joan E. Biren, took an active part in formulating the collective\u2019s theories. She had studied politics at Mount Holyoke College and at Oxford, worked as a summer employee at the State Department, and, as a child, accompanied her father to work at the Pentagon. As the Furies interrogated patriarchal values, though, Biren\u2019s \u00e9lite education began to seem like a problem as much as an asset. It didn\u2019t help that she was a fluent and aggressive debater. Some Furies members alleged that Biren had \u201ca prick in the head,\u201d and she took the criticism seriously. \u201cI needed to shut up,\u201d she later said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I became a photographer.\u201d", "JEB (Self-Portrait), Dyke, Virginia, 1975.", "Before she\u2019d even acquired a camera, Biren decided that she would publish a book of photos of lesbians. The only picture she\u2019d ever seen of two women kissing was a wallet-sized selfie, taken on a borrowed camera with her lover at the time. Biren thrilled to look at it, and she wanted to make more photos that showed open, proud gay women. \u201cI thought of myself absolutely as a propagandist,\u201d she later said. Another Furies member, during a trip to Tokyo to attend activist meetings, bought Biren a Nikkormat at an airport duty-free store. To learn the basics of photography, Biren enrolled in a correspondence course and took a job at a mom-and-pop camera store. She invented a new moniker for her new identity, JEB (pronounced \u201cJeb\u201d), and began searching out portrait subjects."], "authors": ["Sasha Archibald", "Sasha Archibal", "Dan Piepenbrin", "Rumaan Ala"], "keywords": ["lesbians", "photos", "took", "book", "store", "let", "shed", "women", "member", "camera", "furies", "biren"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
