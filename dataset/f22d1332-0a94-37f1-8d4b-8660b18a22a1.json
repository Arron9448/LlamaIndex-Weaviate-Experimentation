This has resulted in an increase in intelligence being submitted to the force by ACT-trained security personnel.\u201d", "The report was discussed at a hearing of the scrutiny committee in June last year. Another paragraph said: \u201cThe key issues continue to be threats relating to international terrorism and domestic terrorism. In addition, the high-profile actions of Extinction Rebellion, which centred around non-violent disobedience, results in some disruption in the City, with the potential for the event to be hijacked or infiltrated by more extremist groups.\u201d", "A City of London police spokesperson said: \u201cCity of London police does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be a terrorist organisation. Ahead of the protests in the summer, our officers, who have regular contact with businesses in the area, spoke to them to ask them to consider the impact of the protests on their business continuity, and to make plans accordingly.\u201d", "The Guardian revealed this month that Extinction Rebellion had been placed on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to authorities running the Prevent programme. Last week it was revealed that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were included in a counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings.", "Police chiefs said any such advice was issued by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) in the south-east of England and not in any other part of the UK, and they branded it an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and vowed to recall the guidance.", "City of London falls under a separate division of the CT policing network, Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), along with the Metropolitan police.", "The Guardian has since heard from teachers and council workers across the country who have received Prevent training that referenced Extinction Rebellion.", "A teacher from south London described a Prevent training session held at her school by a Home Office official, organised by the borough council last September. As part of the training, she was shown an image of a bag with an XR badge affixed.", "She told the Guardian: \u201cThe specialist went through five or six different groups \u2013 there was far right, Islamism, they were all things I\u2019d seen before. The one that did stand out was Extinction Rebellion and climate protesting.\u201d", "A council housing officer whose borough falls within the counter-terrorism policing east region said two police officers provided a Prevent training session to staff in June last year in which they included Extinction Rebellion.", "\u201cI was unable to concentrate for the rest of the session as I was so shocked by the appearance of Extinction Rebellion,\u201d they said.", "A teacher at a college in the Midlands said they were in a induction session in November last year, a large part of which was given over to a representative from a West Midlands counter-terrorism unit.", "\u201cFor the most part she focused on rightwing threats but there was one slide that detailed some alt-right extremist groups alongside XR and surprisingly, Greenpeace,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is entirely inappropriate that XR be considered a terrorist threat or even a group that is to be monitored. Doing so diminishes the threat from other groups and also utterly negates XR\u2019s agenda of challenging climate change.\u201d", "In the north-west, evidence emerged of a Prevent interest in stickers advocating anti-fascism and tougher action on climate change, with images of the stickers circulated to council managers. One questioned why such causes were being included in Prevent\u2019s work and lodged a complaint in late December 2018."], "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "keywords": ["guardian", "rebellion", "included", "extinction", "training", "counterterror", "terrorism", "prevent", "london", "city", "threat", "counterterrorism", "key", "listed"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
