It pledges to \u201clook closely at the current tax exemptions including aviation.\u201d", "An EU-wide jet fuel tax\u2014excluding the U.K.\u2014could cost airlines around 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) a year, more than doubling their current yearly taxes in the bloc, according to a July report from the European Commission. The study is based on a tax of \u20ac330 per kiloliter of kerosene at the point of departure.", "Kerosene burned by airplanes doesn\u2019t incur a fuel tax across European Union countries despite aviation being one of the fastest-growing sources of carbon dioxide. Airline emissions in 2020 will be 70% higher than 2005 levels, the EU estimates, but currently account for only around 3% of the bloc\u2019s overall greenhouse-gas emissions, well behind the 12% emitted by cars.", "The Commission predicts that a jet fuel tax could lower airline emissions by 11% across the 27 member states excluding the U.K., because higher ticket prices would reduce the number of passengers.", "Europe\u2019s five largest airlines\u2014Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, International Consolidated Airlines Group, Ryanair and easyJet PLC\u2014have said they oppose the tax, citing unfair international competition, stifled investment in lower-emission biofuels and what they already pay for carbon credits in Europe.", "In an emailed statement, Lufthansa spokeswoman Sandra Courant said the tax could force airlines to refuel abroad and even result in relocation to non-European hubs. The German group of airlines has its largest bases in Frankfurt and Munich.", "Air France said the tax would harm European airlines\u2019 competitiveness since U.S., Chinese and Middle Eastern carriers don\u2019t face the same constraints. Still, the tax could also hit non-European airlines since carriers would pay in the country they take off from.", "IAG and easyJet said that a fuel tax would cut investment in greener alternatives like biofuels, while Ryanair said it \u201cwill be very damaging for certain economies in the periphery of Europe,\u201d which rely heavily on low-cost air travel.", "European lawmakers argue the tax could raise money for the bloc\u2019s ambition of net-zero emissions by 2050, which could cost close to $13 trillion over two decades, according to the commission. Europe\u2019s leaders have pledged to heavily invest to transform the EU\u2019s transport and energy economy.", "Karima Delli, chair of the European Parliament transport committee and French Green party member, said in an interview that the tax will find enough support in Brussels since several countries are already behind it. Last month, finance ministers from nine countries, including the Netherlands, France and Germany, called for taxes on aviation to tackle climate change. \u201cWe need this money,\u201d Ms. Delli said.", "She said funds should be used to make train travel cheaper through subsidies and investment. Traveling by train in Europe can be more expensive than flying despite being more eco-friendly.", "The tax plan may also threaten jobs. With a drop in passenger demand, the Commission estimates the tax could result in the equivalent of 30,000 lost full-time employees\u2014an 11% decrease in aviation jobs\u2014across the EU\u2019s 27 member states, excluding the U.K. Germany and France would be the hardest hit.", "\u201cAll people can talk about is the danger with the jobs, my target is CO2 emissions,\u201d Ms. Delli said.", "Other members of the European Parliament disagree on whether a jet fuel tax is the best path forward.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "Jan-Christoph Oetjen, vice-chair of the transport committee and German European Parliament member for Renew Europe, a center-left party, said it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d a kerosene tax will find majority support in the parliament or the European Council, which represents the heads of nations.", "Mr. Oetjen said that the EU should instead level the playing field by expanding its carbon-credit trading program to all transport sectors. Unlike airlines, maritime companies aren\u2019t part of the EU\u2019s carbon market.", "\u201cFrom my point of view, the next years in transport policy will be crucial,\u201d he said.", "Write to Olivia Bugault at olivia.bugault@wsj.com and Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com"], "id": "4e7df5f0-c85f-349d-8213-0915a1e51e9e", "authors": ["Olivia Bugault", "Dieter Holger", "Olivia.Bugault Wsj.Com", "Dieter.Holger Wsj.Com"], "keywords": ["tax", "european", "jet", "transport", "fuel", "emissions", "fight", "parliament", "member", "commission", "airlines", "taxes"], "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e", "pubDate": null}
