He was calm and expansive as he spoke about his film, Leaving Neverland \u2013 which was about to be broadcast \u2013 about James Safechuck and Wade Robson, who accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them for years.", "As I looked at him leaning back, relaxed as you like, talking casually about \u201cthe Jackson fans\u201d, I thought: \u201cSonny Jim, you have NO IDEA what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d It was like watching an innocent babe wander into a dark wood, the sounds of snarling animals in shadows all around him.", "Well, 10 months later, the innocence is truly gone. The documentary completely shredded what was left of Jackson\u2019s reputation, but that didn\u2019t stop plenty of people putting up a fight in his defence. True to form, members of the Jackson family went on the attack, casting aspersions on Robson, in particular. Jackson\u2019s most-dedicated fans, not known for their rationality, eagerly went after Reed especially, but really anyone who dared to express a sceptical opinion about St Michael. On the day my interview with Reed, Safechuck and Robson went online, I had to block more than 100 Twitter accounts. I couldn\u2019t even imagine how Reed used the internet at all any more.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dan Reed: \u2018As soon as the movie was announced, people were denouncing the victims without even knowing who they were.\u2019 Photograph: Channel 4", "But Reed is a man with pride. So, when I ask him how he coped with thousands \u2013 maybe even tens of thousands \u2013 of people telling him he was a dupe, a bad journalist, a liar and deserved to die, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound blase, but I\u2019ve received unwelcome attention from people I\u2019m a lot more frightened of than Jackson fans \u2013 people from the criminal underworld and terrorist organisations [whom Reed has also made films about].\u201d", "Nonetheless, he admits, he was \u201csurprised at how unceasing the torrent of abuse was\u201d, including reams of threats and emails to his film company, and especially the smearing of Robson and Safechuck. When Reed gave a talk at the Edinburgh festival, Jackson fans protested outside \u2013 \u201cwith signs saying \u2018MJ Innocent\u2019 ... the usual shit,\u201d he says \u2013 and one day they parked a van outside his office and blasted Jackson\u2019s music.", "\u201cI wasn\u2019t even there so it was a bit of a waste of time. I only found out about it because they made a video of it and posted it on Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as the movie was announced, people were denouncing the victims without even knowing who they were. It was just a kneejerk reaction: these guys are liars. And you can\u2019t challenge them with facts because it\u2019s an article of faith for them and any challenges to that belief are blasphemy,\u201d he says. The Jackson family, he points out, have not made any factual challenges: \u201cThey just say: \u2018Our brother was a lovely guy.\u2019\u201d As a result of his experience in the maw of Jackson fandom, Reed is now thinking about making a documentary about other kinds of denialists.", "He no longer looks at his mentions on Twitter \u2013 \u201cthere is no point\u201d \u2013 and Robson and Safechuck pretty much stay away from social media entirely. \u201cIt gives them a measure of calm. I\u2019m amazed at how serene they\u2019ve been through all this. But the movie has been good for them: they feel like their story has been told and entered the public conversation. I think people who saw the movie found Wade and James very credible.\u201d", "Robson sued the Jackson estate in 2015, but a judge ruled that too much time had passed. He tried again in 2017, but it was decided that the corporation was not liable for Jackson\u2019s personal activities. According to news reports, Safechuck and Robson, buoyed by public support, are again trying to take the estate to court.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A protest against Dan Reed and his film outside Channel 4\u2019s offices in London in March 2019. Photograph: George Cracknell Wright/Rex/Shutterstock", "After Leaving Neverland aired, there was much talk about whether people could still enjoy Jackson\u2019s music or whether he would be cast on to the same reject pile as Gary Glitter. Reed was never especially interested in this argument: \u201cI\u2019m not about cancelling Jackson. But I think people should know that he was, at times, a monster to children,\u201d he says.", "How does it feel if he turns on the radio and a Jackson song comes on? Reed laughs: \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t listen to pop music growing up, so I was never very good at recognising his music,\u201d he says. And then, as if he hasn\u2019t outraged Jackson fans enough already he adds, with a final knife twist: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know, until halfway through production on the documentary, that Billie Jean was a Jackson song.\u201d"], "authors": ["Hadley Freeman"], "keywords": ["fallout", "robson", "surprised", "unceasing", "movie", "neverland", "safechuck", "leaving", "went", "jacksons", "reed", "jackson", "fans", "documentary", "twitter", "abuse"]}
