Altogether, 59% of Americans have a FICO Score FICO, -0.70% of 700 or higher, the largest percentage ever at that threshold.", "Having a credit score at or above 700 is generally an indicator of good credit for most lenders, Experian noted. \u201cThese borrowers may receive a wider variety of credit product offers, at better interest rates, than those with scores below 700,\u201d Matt Tatham, manager of content insights and data analyst at Experian Consumer Services, wrote in the report. \u201cA score of 800 or higher is usually considered excellent.\u201d", "Read more: This woman paid off $10,000 in credit-card debt with a personal loan, but her first attempt landed her in the red again", "The growth in credit scores largely reflects the positive changes consumers have been making. Late-payments and delinquency rates have steadily dropped for most forms of debt over the last decade, which has gone a long way toward improving scores.
