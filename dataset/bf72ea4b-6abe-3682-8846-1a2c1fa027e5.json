Arrive early\u2014doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!\u201d The posters called it the \u201cSave America March.\u201d What happened that day was big, and it was wild. If it began as a protest and a rally and a march, it ended as something altogether different. But what? Sedition, treason, a failed revolution, an attempted coup? And what will it be called, looking back? A day of anarchy? The end of America?", "Trump called the people who violently attacked and briefly seized the U.S. Capitol building in order to overturn a Presidential election \u201cpatriots\u201d; President-elect Joe Biden called them \u201cterrorists.\u201d In a section of \u201cLeviathan\u201d called \u201cInconstant Names,\u201d Thomas Hobbes, in 1651, remarked that the names of things are variable, \u201cFor one man calleth Wisdome, what another calleth Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice.\u201d On the other hand, sometimes one man is right (those people were terrorists). And, sometimes, what to call a thing seems plain. \u201cThis is what the President has caused today, this insurrection,\u201d Mitt Romney, fleeing the Senate chamber, told a Times reporter.", "By any reasonable definition of the word (including the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s: \u201cThe action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority\u201d), what happened on January 6th was an insurrection. An insurrection is, generally, damnable: calling a political action an insurrection is a way of denouncing what its participants mean to be a revolution. \u201cThere hath been in Rome strange insurrections,\u201d Shakespeare wrote, in \u201cCoriolanus.\u201d \u201cThe people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.\u201d Insurrection, in Shakespeare, is \u201cfoul,\u201d \u201cbase and bloody.\u201d In the United States, the language of insurrection has a vexed racial history. \u201cInsurrection\u201d was the term favored by slaveowners for the political actions taken by people held in human bondage seeking their freedom. Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, charged the king with having \u201cexcited domestic insurrections amongst us.\u201d The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, an opponent of slavery, once offered a toast \u201cTo the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.\u201d And Benjamin Franklin, wryly objecting to Southern politicians\u2019 conception of human beings as animals, offered this rule to tell the difference between them: \u201csheep will never make any insurrections.\u201d", "The term\u2019s racial inflection lasted well beyond the end of slavery. In the nineteen-sixties, law-and-order Republicans used that language to demean civil-rights protests, to describe a political movement as rampant criminality. \u201cWe have seen the gathering hate, we have heard the threats to burn and bomb and destroy,\u201d Richard Nixon said, in 1968. \u201cIn Watts and Harlem and Detroit and Newark, we have had a foretaste of what the organizations of insurrection are planning for the summer ahead.\u201d In that era, though, \u201criot\u201d replaced \u201cinsurrection\u201d as the go-to racial code word: \u201criots\u201d were Black, \u201cprotests\u201d were white, as Elizabeth Hinton argues in an essential, forthcoming book, \u201cAmerica on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s.\u201d \u201cYet historically,\u201d Hinton observes, \u201cmost instances of mass criminality have been perpetrated by white vigilantes hostile to integration and who joined together into roving mobs that took \u2018justice\u2019 in their own hands.\u201d This remains an apt description of what happened on January 6th.", "One possibility, then, is to call the Sixth of January a \u201crace riot.\u201d Its participants were overwhelmingly white; many were avowedly white supremacists. A lot of journalists described the attack on the legislature as a \u201cstorming\u201d of the Capitol, language that white-supremacist groups must have found thrilling. Hitler\u2019s paramilitary called itself the Sturmabteilung, the Storm detachment; Nazis published a newspaper called Der St\u00fcrmer, the stormer. QAnon awaits a \u201cStorm\u201d in which the satanic cabal that controls the United States will be finally defeated. So one good idea would be never, ever to call the Sixth of January \u201cthe Storming of the Capitol.\u201d", "What words will historians use in textbooks? Any formulation is a non-starter if it diminishes the culpability of people in positions of power who perpetrated the lie that the election was stolen. It\u2019s not a coup d\u2019etat because it didn\u2019t succeed. It\u2019s not even a failed coup, because a coup involves the military. And, as Naunihal Singh, the author of \u201cSeizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,\u201d told Foreign Policy, the word \u201ccoup\u201d lets too many people off the hook. \u201cThe people who you want to point fingers at are the president, the party leaders, and the street thugs,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd we lose that if we start talking about a coup; it gives a pass to all of the Republican politicians who have been endorsing what Trump\u2019s saying.\u201d", "In truth, the language of the coop seems more appropriate than the language of the coup. I mean chickens. \u201cComing home to roost\u201d quite aptly describes the arrival of armed terrorists in the hall where, moments before, Senator Ted Cruz had summoned that very flock as he stood on the floor and urged the legislature to overturn the election. Derrick Evans, the West Virginia Republican lawmaker who joined the mob and, as he breached the doors of the Capitol, cried out, \u201cWe\u2019re in! We\u2019re in!\u201d acted with more honesty and consistency than the hundred and forty-seven members of the House and Senate who, later that night, voted to overturn the results of the election after having hidden, for hours, from the very people they\u2019d been inciting for months and even years.", "\u201cSedition\u201d is too weak. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, from 1828, offered this handy way to distinguish \u201csedition\u201d from \u201cinsurrection\u201d: \u201csedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.\u201d In any case, sedition in the sense of a political rebellion, is obsolete. \u201cTreason,\u201d an attempt to overthrow the government, seems fair, though it almost risks elevating what looked to be a shambles: a shabby, clownish, idiotic, and aimless act of mass vandalism. If I were picking the words, I\u2019d want to steer very clear of ennobling it, so I\u2019d be inclined to call it something blandly descriptive, like \u201cThe Attack on the U.S. Capitol,\u201d or \u201cThe Sixth of January.\u201d", "\u201cRemember this day forever!\u201d Trump tweeted at one minute past six on Wednesday night. There\u2019s no danger that anyone will forget it, by whatever name. The harder question is not what to call the events of that day, but what to make of the maddening four years and more that led up to it: the long, slow rot of the Republican Party; the perfidy of Republicans in the House and Senate since January, 2017; the wantonness of a conservative media willing to incite violence; the fecklessness of Twitter and Facebook; and, not least, the venality, criminality, and derangement of the President. Whether that story belongs under a chapter titled \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Donald J. Trump\u201d or \u201cThe End of America\u201d awaits the outcome of events.", "Read More About the Attack on the Capitol"], "authors": ["Jill Lepore", "Jill Lepor", "Benjamin Wallace-Well", "Susan B.
