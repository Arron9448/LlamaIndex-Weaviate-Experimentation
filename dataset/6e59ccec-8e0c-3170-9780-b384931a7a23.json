He openly contemplated cabinet roles and lobbied Washington lawmakers around stimulus relief. And he often made television appearances from his weekend home in the Hudson Valley rather than from his apartment in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.", "Andrew Yang has a habit of practicing politics in unexpected ways.", "He began the presidential race as an unknown candidate and stayed relevant longer than more accomplished politicians did, building an ardent fan base through his quirky style, warnings about automation and championing of a universal basic income. He now turns to the New York City mayor\u2019s race with significant name recognition, a vivid social media presence and a demonstrated ability to raise money.", "But he is still every bit the unorthodox contender, and that approach offers Mr. Yang both opportunities and monumental challenges in the race to lead New York out of a pandemic-fueled crisis. His candidacy \u2014 which may be officially announced as early as this week \u2014 would offer a clear test of whether New Yorkers want a splashy but inexperienced contender with bold ideas for navigating the city\u2019s recovery, or whether a mood of citywide emergency propels a more familiar local figure with a traditional governing background."], "authors": ["Katie Glueck"], "keywords": ["hall", "race", "yorkers", "carry", "week", "wayshe", "york", "contender", "star", "yangs", "power", "andrew", "weekend", "city", "yang", "candidate", "yorks"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
