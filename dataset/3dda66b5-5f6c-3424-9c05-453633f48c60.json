Stock prices of many banks are substantially lower to Book values indicating shareholders are shouldering substantial amount of risk of banks\u2019 portfolio and operations.

The market risk framework has been largely overhauled, with improvements that include increased granularity and the introduction of the \u201cexpected shortfall\u201d concept in the Standardised Approach, comprehensive risk capture and a more granular model approval process in the Internal Models Approach. Basel framework includes the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), standards aimed at ensuring banks\u2019 resilience to liquidity stress.", "The new architecture of \u2018Risk Management\u2019 has two important tenets: risk quantification and establishing control systems. The Basel Accords (Basel-II and III) demands utmost importance for risk management systems in Banks and Financial Institutions and directs these institutions to adopt risk capital allocation based on quantification of risk.", "In this context, this programme is intended to cover all generic risks, i.e. Liquidity Risk, Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk and other specific risks of ICAAP. The complex function of risk management demands application of sophisticated models for measuring and managing risks, and this programme aims at improving the competence of managers in selection and application of modern techniques of risk management."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["financial", "regulatory", "framework", "capital", "systems", "banks", "institutions", "risk", "risks", "ratio", "liquidity", "management"], "pubDate": "2021-02-24T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
