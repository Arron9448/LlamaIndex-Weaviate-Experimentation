Jacques\u2019 bestselling stories of talking mice, squirrels and otters (the goodies) and rats, foxes and wildcats (the baddies) gave me so much happiness as a child. The first novel, 1986\u2019s Redwall, was my introduction to fantasy: Matthias, a young orphan mouse, seeks a lost sword to see off an evil rat army led by Cluny the Scourge. (\u201cCluny was a God of War! Cluny was coming nearer!\u201d) Heroism and sacrifice, comedy and evil \u2013 all of life is contained in Jacques\u2019 anthropomorphic world.", "After Redwall, Jacques told the story of how Redwall Abbey came to be, in the sequel Mossflower, as Martin the Warrior (another mouse, of course) arrives to save the creatures of the forest from the grip of the wildcats (Tsarmina Greeneyes is a particularly wonderful villain). Mattimeo continued the saga, following Matthias\u2019s son as he is kidnapped by the slaver fox Slagar the Cruel (another excellent baddie; Jacques does villainous animals very well).", "Born in 1939, Jacques\u2019 books were informed by the second world war, and his memories of rationing. Even the word \u201cfeast\u201d transports me to his depictions of groaning tables laden with deeper\u2019n\u2019ever pies, Goody Stickle\u2019s new yellow cheese, \u201cbulrush and water-shrimp soup provided by the otters; a large flagon of Skipper\u2019s famous hot root punch\u201d.", "The whole saga continues for some two dozen books; for my money, the first three are the best, and Redwall is definitely one for kids who love the talking animals of Dick King-Smith. There is darkness in Jacques\u2019 world, but it is less terrifying \u2013 and far less adult \u2013 than Watership Down. There is humour, but less wordiness than The Wind in the Willows. This is something for children to read alone and have fun with, chunky slices of adventure they can lose themselves in. It has been a delight to see my daughters enjoying the books as I did, weeping inconsolably at the deaths of Methuselah and Warbeak, as I did. \u201cFinally!\u201d the eldest just told me, at the news of the forthcoming adaptation.", "Patrick McHale, creator of the Netflix animation Over the Garden Wall, will be writing the feature film, which will be based on the first book in the series, Variety reports. This will be the first time a feature film of any of Jacques\u2019 works has been made, although there was a cartoon series in the late 90s. Netflix is also developing a series based on Martin the Warrior.", "\u201cBrian often travelled the globe to tell his Redwall stories to young audiences, more often than not at their schools,\u201d Alan Ingram, representative of the Redwall Abbey Company, which has owned Jacques\u2019 intellectual property since his death in 2011, told Deadline. \u201cBrian would have been very happy to see that Netflix shares his joy and desire to bring his stories to life as a new universe of films, series and potentially much more for audiences of all ages to enjoy.\u201d", "Redwaaaaaall!
