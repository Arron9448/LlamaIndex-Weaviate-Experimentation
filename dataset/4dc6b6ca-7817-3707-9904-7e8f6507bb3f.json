Jason of Beverly Hills earrings. Rings and bracelets by Chopard and Tiffany & Co. Manolo Blahnik shoes. Photographed by Hype Williams, Vogue, October 2020", "IN OUR NEW WORLD, where travel is no longer advisable and social distancing mandatory, it has been a bit hard to connect with Lizzo. She has been on vocal rest in her home in Los Angeles, while I\u2019m mostly isolated in my house on the East Coast. When a window of time finally opens, she settles in before the Zoom camera dressed casually, her sweater falling off her shoulders. She looks even more youthful than her 32 years, with her hair in two buns, reminding me of another princess, the fictional Leia from Star Wars. Both women took on the world and won. For Lizzo, this was not necessarily in our national script; for a Black woman it is never a given. But Lizzo\u2019s script is an updated one. As she sings in \u201cScuse Me\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t need a crown to know that I\u2019m a queen.\u201d", "This is not the first time I have encountered the singer. On my birthday last year, my teenage daughter gave me tickets to her concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. She knew I would be ecstatic because every morning, as I pedaled away on my stationary bike, Lizzo\u2019s music filled our home. It had been a long time since I first visited Radio City, on a class trip to see the Rockettes. In my memory, they were a line of leggy white women kicking the air\u2014maybe a woman of color or two was included, but they are not who I remember. This time, the Black woman onstage would leave an imprint.", "As my daughter and I made our way to our seats, we passed through one of the most diverse crowds I have ever seen at a concert: queer men, older than I am, holding hands; suburban-looking women with young girls; people who drove their SUVs through the tunnels or across the bridges, judging from the license plates of the cars blocking the streets outside. All came to see Lizzo\u2014in gold lam\u00e9 pants with THAT BITCH embroidered down each leg\u2014probably for the same reason my daughter and I did. Her music was a part of our daily lexicon\u2014a means of communicating a myriad of emotions at breakneck speed.", "Driving home from the concert, I was struck by the sense that I had experienced something singular. Lizzo is the kind of artist who speaks to multitudes because\u2014in an era of fake news and lying politicians and stressed-out white Americans shouting racist words at stressed-out people of color\u2014she was committed to positivity. This despite the trolls going after her for her race, her weight, her sexuality. Anyone who could understand what it was like to be targeted felt spoken to by Lizzo. They were seen by Lizzo and were taking her lead to love themselves a little bit harder."], "authors": ["Claudia Rankine", "Claudia Rankin", "Hype William"], "keywords": ["justice", "city", "election", "woman", "women", "stressedout", "lizzo", "concert", "music", "daughter", "white", "hope", "world"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
