Manila time,", "isn't it?", "It is, but thrilled to be with you, Steve.", "Well, thanks Maria and I've met", "and it's been great to get to know her", "during this tumultuous time in her life.", "Now I know Rappler has actually been in the news this week,", "and I wanna talk about that.", "But first I wanna talk about the viewers just saw you", "getting arrested.", "What is the situation now", "with the various arrests and in one case, a conviction", "that you've had to deal with from that charming gentlemen,", "Mr Duterte that we just saw in that clip.", "So I have eight arrest warrants, right?", "So eight criminal charges and there fall into three buckets,", "cyber libel, I was arrested for that.", "Tax evasion in order", "to file these tax evasion charges,", "the government actually renamed Rappler", "we're no longer a newsgroup, we're a dealer in securities.", "So that's how we,", "they have five tax evasion cases against us.", "And then the last one is kind of the mother case",

just this week, Monday", "I was supposed to testify to fight for my right to travel", "that didn't happen.", "In fact, the government tried to expunge my...", "Anyway, this is all still ongoing.",

to bring us there.", "Well, I guess the one word to describe all of it", "and I think about this all the time now", "is I feel like Joseph Cain in the trial it's cop class.", "I thought about that when I just read", "about the way,", "particularly that cyber libel case went through.", "Tell us like a little bit about it", "because it just seems so incredibly dicey,", "how they brought that particular case against you.", "So I was convicted along with a former colleague Raison,", "does he no longer work with us", "he actually went to work for government", "after he left Rappler, right?", "So we were convicted on June 15th", "and I could go to jail for up to six years", "for a story that I, that was written eight years ago,", "that I didn't write, didn't edit,", "had no supervision over it", "for violating, supposedly violating a law", "that didn't exist at the time that we published it.", "And in order to even get us there,", "the cyber libel law to get us to court.", "They actually had to change the statute of limitations", "of libel from one year to 12 years.", "And then also come up with a novel interpretation", "of republication for digital.", "All of these redefinitions will have an impact on Filipinos", "for posting on social media.", "Now they could be sued for libel for up to 12 years", "having said that, we are appealing it", "and I have two levels of appeals to go", "up to the supreme court, I won't give up.", "Right, and you told me recently", "the total of possible jail time", "that you could serve for this is what?", "All the eight cases that we're facing", "and it took the international lawyers", "it took them all to actually tell me how many,", "it's almost a hundred years,", "total cumulative sentences of these eight criminal charges.", "I hope I stay alive that long.", "[laughs]", "That's it--", "Sorry, I do laugh about it now", "'cause it's almost", "I guess it's kind of gallows humor how do you deal with it,", "it's unbelievable and I just, I laugh.", "How do you deal with it actually?", "Just laughing,", "I mean, there's more to it than that.", "There are some emotional moments in that documentary,", "every time I see you,", "you're always so upbeat and every time I leave,", "and then talking to you,", "I'm about to slash my wrist because it's so disturbing", "what's happened to you.", "I guess, so you play with your own fear,", "it's in your head", "and I just remember that all the time", "and we talk amongst ourselves in our team, right?", "So how do I?", "I think of the worst case scenario of whatever it is", "and then I imagine how I would deal with it.", "I embrace my fear and if I really pulled it tight,", "then I can rob it of its power over me.", "And this goes to everything", "this is also kind of the way that I run Rappler, right?", "We have to embrace our fear and then go beyond that.", "We work flow our responses to our fear.", "So what's the worst case scenario?", "Let's figure it out,", "break it down and then drill it.", "Like for example,", "in the film you see Pia Renada, our reporter at the palace.", "She chase, she follows Duterte right?", "Followed until we were banned.", "Anyway she, we had actually just drilled, right?", "A few days before she was banned from the palace.", "What we should all do if we get harassed", "or if you're prevented access", "and we had it down to it,", "pulling out your cell phone,", "what things needed to be set up on your cell phone", "and how many steps does it take for you to go live", "and you go live.", "And, one of the things she told us after that was that", "when it happened,", "she had just drilled it like a day or so before earlier", "and it worked, so that's it,", "it's like, I guess it's games with yourself as well,", "because the world is doing things you can't control", "so you figure out what you can control, which is yourself.", "Wow, so let's talk about this week's news", "the Rappler was involved in.", "So yesterday Facebook's head of security", "Nathan Gleicher announced, that Facebook has shutdown,", "some accounts, pages and groups originating from China.", "So we all heard about the Russian interference with,", "the American election and before that Ukraine.", "And it looks like China is now taking a page", "about getting involved in, messing with other countries,", "elections and governance", "and one of the people who they were backing", "just like they backed Trump in America was Duterte", "the leader of the Philippines,", "who is your prosecutor and you've investigated him.", "Now did Rappler had a hand in locating", "these groups, these organized groups", "to circulate misinformation,", "didn't they?", "You tell us about that.", "So Facebook about this time 24 hours ago,", "they announced that they would take down", "two influence operations", "and what I mean by influence operations is, state.", "In this particular case, both looked state sponsored,", "but, you in a closed system you feed lies.", "And the end goal of all of that is to change the minds", "to change the way people think", "so they change the way they act.", "In, there were two,", "the first was Chinese influence operations", "they originated from food jam.", "And then the second were Philippine", "domestic influence operations that were linked by Facebook", "to the police and military.", "We had a hand in the domestic one,", "the police and military,", "because we were quite alarmed by the inciting to hate", "inciting to violence against human rights, activists,", "lawmakers, journalists", "and given the anti-terror law that was just passed", "where anyone designated a terrorist", "can be arrested without a warrant", "and held for up to 24 days.", "We felt that, people brought this up,", "we did the stories and then brought it up to Facebook.", "I think the second one,", "the Chinese operations are interesting for me", "'cause we started seeing these accounts filtering in", "a year ago.", "And one of the interests, of course,", "you can look at the report now,", "but it shows you that this network", "the Chinese influence operations were focused", "not just on the Philippines, but on Southeast Asia,", "Taiwan, Indonesia,", "they were most successful in the Philippines", "and in the Philippines, they were pro-Duterte, pro-Marcos.", "They focused on content on the South China sea,", "which is deeply contentious.", "And then finally, of course,", "this is a network that attacked me personally", "I mean, it's kind of good to know that,", "well, we knew this from the data,", "but I was just gonna be glib and say,", "so now China comes in to also join the attacks", "that are state sponsored here.", "So it is exactly what we have seen from four years ago", "is just as usual from Russian disinformation, it spreads", "Chinese disinformation is now evolved,", "has been affected by that and that,", "well it's great that Facebook took it down,", "there is a lot more that needs to be taken down.", "One thing that was interesting,", "that came out from Facebook,", "I think in this first part you said", "it wasn't the content of the posts", "which violated Facebook policy,", "but just the idea that", "they were from these inauthentic networks.", "So basically some of the content just attack you directly", "and what he was saying is Jim that's okay", "you think after all this time,", "Facebook would maybe,", "look at their policies and say,", "is it okay for a policy to be personally attacking", "not just prominent journalists like yourself,", "but anyone with such lies?", "Are these parts of discussions", "that you've had with Facebook?", "Yeah, Steven I mean", "your book actually shows all of the difficulties", "that Facebook has had with this.", "I think that they continue to duck responsibility", "as a publisher, they don't want to be called a publisher,", "even though in a way they are.", "I mean, to all intents and purposes,", "Facebook is the world's largest distributor of news, right?", "But look, the reason we Rappler also,", "don't just look at the content", "because that's a whack-a-mole game, right?", "And it's much easier to think about it", "the work that we did with Counterterrorism before", "actually helped infuse the way we gather data", "and the way we look at networks of disinformation.", "'Cause I don't wanna get distracted by misinformation", "and I also wonder why Americans always use", "misinformation versus disinformation.", "It is very clear,", "there are networks that are meant to manipulate us,", "and those are the ones like terrorism we should take down.", "So that's kind of the way Facebook", "has dealt with the network is, they came up with this,", "this definition,", "CIB coordinated inauthentic behavior, right?", "But the problem is that this definition", "maybe would have worked four years ago in 2016,", "when the information ecosystem,", "the influence operations coming in started, right?", "Well, it started earlier than that", "it started in 2014.", "But anyway now, four years into it,", "like in the Philippines,", "it's the attacks are constant for four years.", "These types of exponential when lives", "laced with anger and hate spread faster", "and further than facts.", "Those lies are part of these information operations", "they change the way people think.", "So four years later,", "real people think this now, I mean real account.", "So how do you deal with that?", "I think that's a failure", "in terms of how Facebook thinks about this,", "because the influence operations", "have fundamentally changed the ecosystem.", "Democracy is weaker everywhere around the world,", "including in your country.", "Yeah I wanna talk about that the second.", "And we've certainly seen that it's an attack on truth,", "but, since the Philippines we're a little ahead on this.", "I wonder as a journalist,", "you do this great investigative journalism,", "but does it get to a point where the audiences", "that you want to present that journalism to", "just won't be affected by it", "because they won't believe anything.", "And that's the goal and I think we are there.", "This is the problem, this is,", "and that's the root,", "that's the core of Russian disinformation, right?", "And that I think was a basic understanding", "that Facebook didn't have", "I mean, they brought in a lot of people in 2018,", "but it was quite late in the game.", "I mean, the attacks against me began in 2016", "journalists equals criminal, right?", "And look at how it went, where it went in 2020,", "there are Filipinos who believe I'm a criminal", "and yet I haven't done anything differently,", "but the information ecosystem was fundamentally changed", "by social media platforms.", "So yeah, so the goal of Russian disinformation", "is not to make you believe in anything,", "but to destroy your trust in everything", "and that includes why are journalists attack?", "Why are news organizations attack?", "Because we bring the facts,", "we still hold power to account.", "I would say in the last four years,", "the journalists have done their jobs", "we continue to do that even when it's become", "far more dangerous to do so", "so in the United States, right?", "But the problem is, that when the information ecosystem", "is so chaotic and when the distribution system", "prioritize lies over facts,", "prioritizes anger and hate over rational thinking.", "Then, you're left", "with a democracy where people can't tell fact from fiction,", "that means you don't have facts, you can't have truth", "you can't have trust.", "How can you have a democracy", "if you have no integrity of facts?", "How can you have integrity of markets?", "And then how can you have integrity of elections, right?", "So having said that", "this is, we saw the reports start to come out", "the research reports start to come out as early as 2017", "and, we felt the attacks in 2016.", "So globally in 2017,", "I think it was Freedom House that said that", "in at least 27 countries around the world,", "cheap armies on social media was rolling back democracy.", "A year later in 2018,", "that was almost doubled by Oxford university's", "Computational Propaganda Research Project.", "And then in 2019,", "it was more than 72 countries", "and who knows, right?", "What we've seen with the Corona virus", "is that power has consolidated power.", "They are automatically given greater power", "because of the virus.", "And in countries like mine, Hungary, lots of Brazil.", "All of a sudden government gets authoritarian style", "populous leaders get far more power and far more money.", "So in 2016, something Ange", "that I tell in my book, Facebook The Inside Story.", "You warned Facebook about this", "you said, this is happening right now in the Philippines.", "And it could be happening in the United States", "it could even elect Donald Trump", "and everyone laughed because that seems so absurd.", "Do you feel that in that time,", "because it was a few years", "that Facebook had been getting these complaints.", "Facebook understood it and was turning a blind eye", "or they hadn't understood it at that point.", "And the second part of the question would be,", "do they really understand it now?", "So I think in 2016, they didn't understand it because...", "So, you know this better", "actually Steven I should ask you.", "They put the growth people in charge, right?", "You would know that better", "they put engineers who were in the word is optimizing.", "So they were optimizing to manipulate us,", "to keep us on the platform", "and also optimizing for money.", "The micro-targeting, I actually always say that", "today, the social media platforms", "are behavior modification systems", "because they take everything we put in,", "they use machine learning to build the models of us", "and then they take our most vulnerable moment to a message.", "And they sell that to the highest bidder", "that micro-targeting makes it extremely potent", "and that bidder can be a government or a company.", "And I don't think this is advertising in the old sense", "anyway, I'm sorry I got derailed.", "But here, I guess the first part of that is that", "in 2016, they may not have known completely,", "but they got repeated warnings.", "I was very personal", "I gave them Excel sheets of stuff", "and the conversation that you've talked about was in 2016.", "In 2017, I did get to talk to Mark Zuckerberg,", "to Sheryl Sandberg I brought up that the Philippines", "in fact, I invited Mark to come visit the Philippines", "to see how powerful Facebook is.", "Facebook is our internet a hundred percent.", "Did he take up--", "I'm sorry say again.", "Did he take up your invitation?", "No.", "The way he dealt with it was,", "he was just starting the travel through the US", "'cause he was just realizing how little he knew, right?", "So he's, you know this better than I,", "because you've sat in so many interviews with him,", "but he struck me as a bright young man.", "Yeah 'cause I'm much older than,", "but had never lived outside the United States.", "And, I told him I said, Mark,", "97 at that point was 97% of Filipinos on the internet", "that are on Facebook, Facebook is our internet.", "And then he just looked at me and this was like maybe about", "10 or 11, no more than a dozen of us.", "And then he just said,", "wait Maria,", "where are the other 3%?", "Well, you got the other 3% in the succeeding years", "and I laughed at that point in time,", "but now it's just look", "looking at these influence operations.", "This is insidious manipulation of us.", "And I guess that's my question is", "how can we do we have freewill?", "That's one, the second is and this is something", "that the Chinese influence operations do.", "They were the post that they posted against me", "were inciting hate.", "Inciting hate, inciting violence", "degrading you so that you're not a human being", "these things are extremely dangerous.", "And we've seen the violence erupt in countries like Myanmar,", "where the UN sent a special, a fact finding group", "and Facebook sent its own", "and they determined that genocide happened.", "Gosh, I mean Steven, we can talk about so many things, yeah", "Yeah, I guess you tell me what do you think", "are you hopeful?", "Me, well, I mean I'm disturbed", "I'm disturbed that what's happening", "in the Philippines and in America.", "But when I said this is something positive,", "we have a question from our audience that,", "maybe we can finish on a more of an upbeat note.", "So what is Justin Slootsky asks", "what is an achievable positive change", "that could be made in the world in the next five years?", "So I'm going to so many things that I would to happen,", "but if I could like wave a magic wand,", "enlightened self-interests for Facebook.", "It's so strange", "'cause I was just talking to some of the folks there,", "they have tremendous power,", "but it's the abdication of the use of the power.", "They don't want it, Mark has said this,", "you don't want Facebook being the arbiter of free speech.", "Like I feel every time I hear that", "and every time I hear a Facebook rep say that,", "I always think, good God get over yourself, you already are.", "And the choices that you have made", "have destroyed democracy and put people like me", "in extreme danger and has killed people", "because the problem is that, the global South,", "our countries are the ones that bear the brunt", "of Silicon Valley's decisions.", "So a positive thing number one,", "I guess Facebook is asking for regulations.", "Regulations take time", "I hope enlightened self interest happens that Facebook", "does things like what it just did 24 hours ago,", "take down these networks of disinformation", "that are fomenting hate,", "that are spreading lies that are meant to kill democracy", "that's one and it isn't just Facebook.", "It's these kinds of designs,", "the kind of the algorithms", "that create a loop that manipulate us", "these things are embedded in every social media platform,", "it's just, Facebook", "is the world's largest distributor of news.", "I think that's that's one.", "The second is can the world please come together", "we're watching the UN general assembly", "on the 75th year, right?", "But 75 years ago,", "the atom bomb went off the end of world war II,", "the end of fascism.", "And now it looks like we're on the cusp of returning", "to fascism if we cannot solve this problem", "that was created by moving fast and breaking things right?", "So, we've talked about this all the time,", "'cause I go Steven, please tell me, give me hope.", "I have a lot of,", "I put a lot of hope and faith still in Facebook", "we can't put the genie back in the bottle", "and I'm just hoping that they move fast enough", "and do not wait for legislation.", "Having said that they asked for it", "so yes, we need laws", "we need to come together beyond the laws", "and treat it like we did post world war II.", "The world came together to prevent humanity", "from destroying itself", "and that's when we created the UN,", "the UN declaration of human rights, right?", "So this is another one of those moments,", "we need to do this and this protects our lives", "and our democracies.", "Well, I asked you for positive", "you gave me atom bombs and Fascisms Maria.", "But you are the inspiration.", "You are positive", "[mumbles]", "Anyway I wanna thank you so much.", "You can go to sleep now", "and wire 25 thanks you", "and best of luck to you.", "To you too, thanks."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"],
