The Sun went for \u201cPayback Time\u201d, while the Sunday Express had \u201cFreedom \u2026 at a price.\u201d", "A tweet from the TV host Piers Morgan \u2013 who claims he was friends with Meghan before she snubbed him after meeting Harry \u2013 was quoted widely. \u201cThe Queen has told Meghan and Harry to sling their part-time royal hook,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWell done, Your Majesty, right decision. Only surprised it took her so long to get Harry to ditch his family, the monarchy, the military and his country. What a piece of work.", "\u201cBottom line: Meghan and Harry wanted to have their cake and eat it, but the Queen just took the cake back to the royal kitchens.\u201d", "Camilla Long, in the Sunday Times, was among the most scathing, arguing that among the victims of the couple\u2019s decision were people working in the Grenfell soup kitchen visited by Meghan this month.", "\u201cYou know who the real victim in this whole Harry and Meghan thing is? It isn\u2019t Harry or Meghan, however much these fey children tell us they\u2019ve had their spirits \u2018crushed\u2019 by the sheer number of palaces and diamonds and footmen we\u2019ve flung at them,\u201d wrote Long.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t us, even though we\u2019ve had the stupidity to pay this pair of oxygen thieves more than \u00a360,000 a day, if you take into account the \u00a332m wedding, the \u00a32.4m cottage renovation, the security and fripperies and Meghan\u2019s dresses, for the privilege of being patronised and dissed to our faces by them, since they married in May 2018.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the poor, sweet, benighted ladies of the Grenfell soup kitchen I feel sorry for, who have been repeatedly duped into smiling and nodding as the duchess sweeps in to pretend to cook rice on yet another of her many content-gathering missions.\u201d", "Most papers interpreted the agreement between the Queen and the couple as a decisive and unsentimental move by the monarch. The Sun quoted Alastair Bruce, an expert on royal protocol, as saying the Queen had brought \u201cdown the iron fist of monarchical leadership\u201d on a problem that needed to be solved. \u201cShe has made it very clear that the royal status, the princely status, should be dissolved,\u201d he wrote.", "Camilla Tominey, in the Sunday Telegraph, argued that \u201csince the monarchy isn\u2019t just a family but a business, what other option was there when two of its major shareholders had declared their intent to start a rival firm in North America? The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had handed in their notice \u2013 and this was the Queen giving them their P45.\u201d", "Andrew Morton, who wrote a biography of Diana, Princess of Wales, said in the Sun that the loss of the HRH titles could affect the couple\u2019s pulling power. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to affect Diana much. She lost the HRH when she divorced Prince Charles in 1996. If anything, her profile increased as an independent woman. But she had been on the royal stage for 16 years before her tragic death. Meghan has been part of that scene for just a couple,\u201d he said.", "Hugo Vickers, in the Mail on Sunday, expressed similar concern that by surrendering his royal status Prince Harry could \u201close his allure and appeal \u2013 and people could tire of them both\u201d.", "Vickers added: \u201cThat is surely a very real danger in the fickle world of celebrity culture.
