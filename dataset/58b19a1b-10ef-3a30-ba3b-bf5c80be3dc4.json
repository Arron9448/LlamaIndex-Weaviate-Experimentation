So, it seems, do efforts to protect netizens\u2019 privacy. The European Union led the world with its General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which came into force in May 2018. That law shook up internet giants and global advertising firms, both of which had previously used\u2014and at times abused\u2014consumer data with little oversight. On December 11th India\u2019s government introduced a bill that would force firms to handle data only with consumer consent and give the authorities sweeping access to them. The same day Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, promised a review of privacy laws and said the competition authority will monitor how advertising is done on digital platforms. But the most important piece of legislation rhyming with GDPR right now is the California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ), which comes into force on January 1st. To online businesses, it jars.", "The Californian law copies some of the GDPR \u2019s provisions. It gives consumers the right to know what online information is collected about them and how it is used, permits them to demand that their data be destroyed and to sue companies for data breaches. In some ways, the CCPA is looser than its European predecessor. It does not, for instance, insist that firms have a \u201clegal basis\u201d for collecting and using personal data or restrict the international transfer of data. It also stops short of demanding the appointment of corporate data-protection officers and assessments of projects\u2019 data-protection risks. And whereas the GDPR lets individuals demand that private information about them be removed from the web under certain circumstances, the First Amendment makes this \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d a non-starter in America.", "In other respects, though, California goes further than the EU . The CCPA adopts a broader definition of personal information (which extends to such things as internet cookies that identify users on websites) and it explicitly forbids discrimination (by offering discounts to those who grant firms access to their data). Companies must enable Californians to opt out of the sale of personal data with a clear \u201cdo not sell\u201d link on their home page, rather than through GDPR \u2019s fiddlier process. Michelle Richardson of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, a privacy-advocacy group which is bankrolled in part by big tech companies, calls the CCPA \u201cground-breaking\u201d.", "The California law will apply to firms with revenues of $25m or more that do business in the state or process its residents\u2019 data, even if not based there. Any for-profit entity anywhere that buys, shares or sells the data from more than 50,000 Californian customers, households or devices a year is also covered. Law-breakers face fines of up to $7,500 for every violation, compared with 4% of global annual revenues or \u20ac20m ($22m), whichever is higher, for the GDPR . But California\u2019s relatively trifling ceiling can add up quickly for firms with thousands of users.", "The GDPR \u2019s track record suggests the effects of the CCPA will be far-reaching. Some 250,000 complaints have been lodged under the EU rules, and some penalties approach \u20ac100m. If breaking the rules could prove expensive, so is respecting them. The International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry body, and EY , an accountancy, reckon that complying with the GDPR costs the average firm $2m. Tech firms spend over $3m; financial firms, more than $6m. By one estimate, the total cost to all American firms with more than 500 employees could reach $150bn.", "\u201cInitial compliance\u201d with the CCPA may, for its part, cost the estimated 500,000-odd affected American firms $55bn, according to a study commissioned by California\u2019s attorney-general. Any such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. For one thing, global firms that are already GDPR -compliant have a head start, even if differences between the two laws mean abiding by the Californian one will be far from automatic. Big firms, which are already on the hook for GDPR , are expected to spend another $2m each. For the tech giants that looks like chump change. Microsoft and Apple say they are not only ready for CCPA , but also plan to implement it across America.", "For America\u2019s legions of smaller online trinket-sellers, app-makers or other firms present on the internet the Californian law will be onerous. They can ignore European regulations, because most have no EU business, but cannot easily stay away from one of America\u2019s biggest domestic markets. A new survey by the US Chamber of Commerce, a lobby group, claims that only 12% of small businesses in America know about the law, let alone have prepared for it.", "The impact of the CCPA is being felt beyond boardrooms. Big Tech is lobbying lawmakers in Washington, DC , for a federal statute on the subject. \u201cWe really, really support an omnibus federal privacy law,\u201d says a data-privacy official at a large American technology company. Facebook and Google do, too, they profess. The US Chamber of Commerce, better known for opposing regulations, is also now in favour.", "One explanation for tech firms\u2019 sudden enthusiasm to safeguard user information is their reasonable desire to avert a balkanised mess of contradictory state laws. Illinois, New York and Washington have differing state legislation in the works. Many others are looking into the matter.", "Tame west, wild east"], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["dataprivacy", "state", "firms", "gdpr", "sheriffs", "tech", "information", "data", "privacy", "companies", "californias", "californian", "seriously", "ccpa", "law"], "id": "58b19a1b-10ef-3a30-ba3b-bf5c80be3dc4", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/12/21/companies-should-take-californias-new-data-privacy-law-seriously"}
