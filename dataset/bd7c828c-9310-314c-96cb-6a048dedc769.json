These days, she told me recently, \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with avena\u201d\u2014Spanish for \u201coatmeal.\u201d \u201cThey have a particular way of doing it, with cinnamon and milk\u2014just go into any Dominican bodega here and say \u2018avena\u2019 and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\u201d In general, she said, \u201cit\u2019s a lot of really hearty comfort food,\u201d not so different from the dishes she serves herself, inspired by the hawker-stall classics of her home town; both emphasize seafood, especially shrimp.", "Miniature steamed buns are deep-fried and served with chili-crab dip as a contained, snack-sized version of a signature Singaporean dish featuring whole crustaceans.", "Dried shrimp are key to the slow-cooked, gently spicy coconut curry in Pryke\u2019s spin on laksa, a soup popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Her interpretation, more saucy than brothy, is optimized for takeout and delivery (seating is limited at the counter-service shop): a creamy-curry-coated nest of thick rice noodles, topped with crunchy matchsticks of cucumber, crispy onions, bean sprouts, spongy cubes of fried tofu, and an additional choice of protein. (The menu recommends fresh, tail-on shrimp, which are lightly griddled until crunchy.)", "Chili crab, one of Singapore\u2019s most famous dishes, is also one of the most unwieldy, a gloriously messy pile of hulking shells and claws stir-fried and splashed in a thick, sweet, and spicy gravy of tomato and chili, served with puffy, sweet mantou buns, steamed and then deep-fried, to sop it up. At Native Noodles, the dish comes in two cleverly contained forms: chili-crab pasta, featuring swirls of linguine slicked in ruddy gravy and spangled with lump meat, and chili-crab buns\u2014mini mantou, their surfaces as crackly as cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, with a cup of crab gravy for dipping.", "Pork shoulder is basted in honey before being cooked and sliced thin, then served with a soft-boiled egg and bok choy over garlic rice.", "Pryke chose to feature noodles because they\u2019re universally familiar, and because she saw them as a medium to illustrate how Singaporean food\u2014which reflects the island nation\u2019s diverse demographics and its history as a trade hub and is relatively hard to find in New York\u2014fits into a broader landscape of Asian cuisines. That approach helped her get her start, as a vender at the Queens Night Market, in 2019.", "Pryke is not a chef by training. After college, she worked, listlessly, in management consulting. When someone gave her the clich\u00e9d advice to look to her passions as inspiration for a new career, she turned to food, and to business school. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few people who I think actually did what they said they would do in their admissions essay,\u201d she told me, laughing. At the Night Market, she found a business partner in Josh Medina, a co-owner of four Hawaiian restaurants in upper Manhattan. To develop her brick-and-mortar menu, she went back to Singapore last year and worked under a veteran chef-restaurateur who became her mentor.", "The restaurant\u2019s founder, the Singapore native Amy Pryke, chose to focus on noodles as an accessible inroad to a cuisine that\u2019s underrepresented in New York.", "What she landed on makes easy work of comparing Singapore\u2019s Southeast Asian-leaning dishes, such as laksa, chili crab, and satay, to the Cantonese staples you\u2019ll also find there, including wonton noodles and roasted pork over rice, plus the misleadingly named Cantonese dish known as Singapore noodles (saut\u00e9ed rice vermicelli laced with curry powder), whose origins are mysterious but don\u2019t seem traceable to Singapore. The laksa and chili crab, Pryke hopes, will both draw homesick Singaporeans from all over and introduce locals to something new. And though there is excellent Cantonese food to be found in pockets of the city, northern Manhattan is hardly known for it.", "The sweet, salty juices of roasted pork, basted in honey and sliced thin, drip seductively into a dense bed of garlicky rice alongside a soft-boiled soy-sauce egg. Blistered, purse-shaped shrimp-and-pork wontons and frilly leaves of steamed bok choy sit atop thin egg noodles, bathed in just enough broth to keep it shy of soup\u2014Singapore translated for here and now.
