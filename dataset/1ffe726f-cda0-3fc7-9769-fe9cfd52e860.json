Nikki Gravning, country co-director at Ashoka UK, says: \u201cWe believe that becoming a changemaker should be at the heart of every young person\u2019s experience, and that successful organisations today, and of the future, actively seek and promote a culture of changemaking at their core.\u201d", "Salesforce.org has certainly taken heed. The software innovator says it believes in a better future, where \u201ceveryone has a roof over their head, food in their belly, opportunity within reach, and a healthy planet to call home\u201d. It believes this future is possible thanks to the efforts of changemakers.", "But how and why should you foster a changemaking attitude in your organisation?", "Becoming a changemaker", "Experts say that to become a changemaker you need to identify the issue or social challenge that makes your blood pump. \u201cThe first step to becoming a changemaker is being passionate about a social issue,\u201d says Acker. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve identified your passion area, research how to get involved and take action. And it doesn\u2019t take much, one small step can lead to greater impact.\u201d", "To take that first small step, aspiring changemakers need to be empowered. To this end, Acker\u2019s company launched Nonprofit Cloud and Education Cloud to provide changemakers in the nonprofit and education sectors with new technology and tools so they can deliver services faster, streamline processes and build global communities on one system. Adding to the tools for change, the company launched Salesforce.org Philanthropy Cloud, a marketplace for changemaking individuals who knew they wanted to get involved but didn\u2019t know how.
