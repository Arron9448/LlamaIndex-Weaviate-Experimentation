Trial results released at a conference in the United States fired up campaigners. There were marches in the streets, legal actions and an unprecedented political decision by the then UK health secretary Patricia Hewitt to pay for the drug regardless before any cost-effectiveness assessment had been completed.", "It is now a standard treatment for women with HER2+ cancer in affluent countries, with a high cure rate, particularly in early cancers. The WHO listed it as an essential medicine for all countries to buy, but it has been unaffordable in much of the world, with a price tag of about $20,000 (\u00a315,000) per patient.", "With the drug now out of patent, the WHO has approved a biosimilar version \u2013 a cheap copy \u2013 of the monoclonal antibody made by a company in the Netherlands.", "Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said it was good news for women everywhere.", "\u201cWomen in many cultures suffer from gender disparity when it comes to accessing health services. In poor countries, there is the added burden of a lack of access to treatment for many, and the high cost of medicines.

That means it is eligible for procurement by United Nations agencies and for national tenders.", "The price will be 65% lower than Herceptin itself, which at about $9,000 is still a burden for lower income countries, but it is expected that other companies will now come forward for WHO approval. Some of them already sell trastuzumab for as little as $4,000 per patient, but without the WHO stamp their drugs can only be sold in countries that have their own approval process.", "Breast cancer may be detected by blood test five years before clinical signs show Read more", "Death rates from breast cancer are high in low income countries, even though it has become a very curable disease in the more affluent parts of the world.
