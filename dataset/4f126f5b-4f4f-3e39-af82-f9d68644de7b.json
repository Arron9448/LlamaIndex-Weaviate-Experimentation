Otherwise it risks falling behind China and losing its standing on the world stage.", "The report, from the Center for New American Security (CNAS), is the latest to highlight the importance of AI to the future of the US. It argues that the technology will define economic, military, and geopolitical power in coming decades.", "Advanced technologies, including AI, 5G wireless services, and quantum computing, are already at the center of an emerging technological cold war between the US and China. The Trump administration has declared AI a national priority, and it has enacted policies, such as technology export controls, designed to limit China\u2019s progress in AI and related areas.", "The CNAS report calls for a broader national AI strategy and a level of commitment reminiscent of the Apollo program. \u201cIf the United States wants to continue to be the world leader, not just in technology but in political power and being able to promote democracy and human rights, that calls for this type of effort,\u201d says Martijn Rasser, a senior fellow at CNAS and the lead author of the report.", "Rasser and his coauthors believe AI will be as pervasive and transformative as software itself has been. This means it will be of critical importance to economic success as well as military might and global influence. Rasser argues that $25 billion over five years is achievable, and notes that it would constitute less than 19 percent of total federal R&D in the 2020 budget.", "\u201cWe're back in an era of great power competition, and technology is that the center,\u201d Rasser says. \u201cAnd the nation that leads, not just artificial intelligence but technology across the board, will truly dominate the 21st century.\u201d", "Over the past three years, the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy, which shapes the administration's technology strategy, has highlighted the importance of AI and called for federal funds to be redirected towards its development. In its 2020 budget plan, the administration has proposed $5 billion in funding for AI research and development. But officials have generally maintained that the private sector should also play a primary role in investing and developing AI.", "Rasser says this is a mistake because private companies do not invest in the kind of fundamental research that serves as a foundation for big technological advances. \u201cInvestments that the US government made in the \u201850s, \u201860s, and \u201870s propagated the technologies that the American economy, and the global economy, are built on,\u201d he says.", "Artificial intelligence could prove particularly important to America\u2019s military standing. Last month, a report to Congress by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, declared that AI will be critical to US national security. Collaboration between the government and the US tech sector would be vital, it advised.", "\u201cBoth the Russians and the Chinese have concluded that the way to leapfrog the US is with AI,\u201d says Bob Work, a distinguished senior fellow at CNAS who served as deputy secretary of defense under Presidents Obama and Trump. Work says the US needs to convince the public and that it doesn\u2019t intend to develop lethal autonomous weapons, only technology that would counter the work Russia and China are doing.", "In addition to calling for new funding, the CNAS report argues that a different attitude towards international talent is needed. It recommends that the US attract and retain more foreign scientists by raising the number of H1-B visas and removing the cap for people with advanced degrees. \u201cYou want these people to live, work, and stay in the United States,\u201d Rasser says. The report suggests early vetting of applications at foriegn embassies to identify potential security risks.", "Keep Reading The latest on artificial intelligence , from machine learning to computer vision and more", "The administration\u2019s current immigration strategy arguably undermines US competitiveness. Trump\u2019s travel ban, which prevents anyone from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela from coming to the United States, has contributed to a culture unwelcoming to foreign scientists, prompting some to study and work elsewhere. A more rigorous visa vetting process has also reduced the number of Chinese scientists that are able to enter the country."], "title": "Washington Must Bet Big on AI or Lose Its Global Clout", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/washington-bet-big-ai-or-lose-global-clout/", "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Will Knigh"]}
