Our first concern of course is to be sure of that, that she is still alive,\u201d Hurtado said.", "Senior UN officials had sought a meeting with the UAE ambassador in Geneva about Latifa, which in principle had been agreed, Hurtado said. She added that the UN also planned to raise the case of Latifa\u2019s older sister Shamsa, who was kidnapped in 2000 from the streets of Cambridge.", "Concerns over the fate of Latifa, 35, have grown after videos emerged in which she claimed her villa home had been \u201cconverted into a jail\u201d.", "Latifa claimed to have been imprisoned in the villa after an escape attempt in 2018 in which she crossed into neighbouring Oman and took a jetski to a yacht in international waters.

And I can\u2019t even go outside to get any fresh air. I\u2019m doing this video from a bathroom, because this is the only room with a door I can lock. I\u2019m a hostage. I am not free. I\u2019m enslaved in this jail. My life is not in my hands.\u201d", "She has not been heard from in six months, according to her friends.", "The UAE\u2019s embassy in London said that \u201cmedia coverage does not reflect the true situation\u201d and she was being cared for at home supported by her family and medical professionals. \u201cShe continues to improve and we are hopeful she will return to public life at the appropriate time,\u201d a statement last month said.", "Sheikh Mohammed has said his daughter \u2013 the second of his children to try to escape \u2013 is in the loving care of her family.", "His youngest wife, Princess Haya, also left Dubai fearing for her life after claiming she was subjected to a campaign of intimidation and harassment.
