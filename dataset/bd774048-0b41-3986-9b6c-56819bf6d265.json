The same cannot be said of shareholders in Aston Martin Lagonda ( AML ), which owns the prestige brand. An ill-judged initial public offering in 2018, predicated on rapid growth, has the company careening.", "The IPO was an attempt to emulate the success of Ferrari, which floated in 2015. (The chairman of Exor, which has a significant stake in Ferrari, also sits on the board of The Economist\u2019s parent company.) The Italian supercar-maker enjoys 25% operating margins, closer to what LVMH makes on its Louis Vuitton handbags than what Daimler gets for Mercedes cars. Ferrari\u2019s share price has trebled since going public. AML \u2019s, by contrast, has plunged by three-quarters. Its market value now stands at just \u00a31.1bn ($1.4bn). After turning an operating profit in 2017 and 2018, in November it reported a loss for the first nine months of last year. On January 7th the company issued its second profit warning since July.", "AML is selling far fewer cars than it hoped\u201420% fewer relative to early forecasts for 2019, when around 5,800 actually rolled off the production line. The goal of making 14,000 cars a year by 2023 looks fanciful. Attempts to meet it, by investing in new models, have left AML with net debts of around \u00a3900m. Wary bond investors are demanding coupons as high as 15% to refinance \u00a3100m about to come due. Aston Martin has pasted its logo on helicopters and blocks of flats. But if Max Warburton of Bernstein, an equity-research firm, is correct in his heretical suggestion that perhaps the brand is not that strong after all, such non-auto ventures may flop.", "Aston\u2019s legacy of losing money is as rich as that of making fast and glamorous cars. In its 106 years James Bond\u2019s wheels of choice have endured seven bankruptcies. This time investors bet on AML thanks to a credible leader\u2014Andy Palmer, a shrewd industry executive\u2014and a plausible plan to expand its range of vehicles. It has already launched three new GT cars, suited to long, comfy journeys. Next year it plans to unveil a mid-engined car, the Valhalla, to take on Ferrari, better-known for such machines. And it has taken 1,800 orders for its SUV , the DBX , following in the tyretracks of Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini.", "Even if all these AML offerings prove wildly successful, they may not bring in enough cash to ensure a succession of new models needed to keep wealthy petrolheads coming back to the brand. Philippe Houchois of Jefferies, a bank, reckons that if AML sells 5,000 of the cars that start at \u00a3158,000 at a 15% margin, that would only bring in enough cash to cover \u00a3100m in annual interest on its debts. The overall market for sports cars is not growing fast and Evercore ISI , a broker, points out that rivals\u2019 SUV s have eaten into sales of their other cars. AML can expect the same."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["aml", "cars", "idle", "brand", "martin", "aston", "fast", "suv", "company", "ferrari", "s", "driving", "stuck"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
