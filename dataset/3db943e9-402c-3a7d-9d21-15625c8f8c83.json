{"pubDate": null, "title": "Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father\u2019s Campaign?", "paragraphs": ["In today\u2019s political culture, people running for President may announce their candidacy on the steps of their home-town city hall or on \u201cThe View,\u201d but the full introduction comes with their book. Some candidates\u2019 memoirs tell stories of humble beginnings and of obstacles overcome; some describe searches for identity; some earnestly set out detailed policy agendas. Nearly all are relentlessly bland. In 2017, Joe Biden, a longtime senator from Delaware, Barack Obama\u2019s Vice-President for eight years, and now a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, published an unusually raw memoir about the death, two years earlier, of his forty-six-year-old son, Beau, describing how it had threatened to undo him but ultimately brought his family closer. Beau, his father writes, was \u201cJoe Biden 2.0,\u201d a war veteran, a prosecutor, and a promising politician who \u201chad all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.\u201d In the early months of the 2020 race, Joe Biden holds a lead over his many Democratic Party rivals, but he is hardly invulnerable. He is seventy-six and sometimes shows it. He often stumbles when defending his five-decade public history. Some voters will not easily overlook his support for the Iraq War, his treatment of Anita Hill and loose management of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, his handsy, close-talking behavior with women, or his descriptions of his \u201ccivil\u201d working relationships with segregationist lawmakers. Even his admirers concede that he is prone to senatorial bloviation. What often seems to redeem him with voters, as a former senior White House aide put it recently, is \u201chow he\u2019s responded to tragedy and what he\u2019s learned from it.\u201d Yet the family story that Biden tells in \u201cPromise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose\u201d largely glosses over a central character in Biden\u2019s life. Biden writes, \u201cI was pretty sure Beau could run for President some day, and, with his brother\u2019s help, he could win.\u201d Hunter Biden, who is forty-nine, is described as a supportive son and sibling. In speeches, Biden rarely talks about Hunter. But news outlets on the right and mainstream media organizations, including the Times, have homed in on him, reprising old controversies over Hunter\u2019s work for a bank, for a lobbying firm, and for a hedge fund, and scrutinizing his business dealings in China and Ukraine. There is little question that Hunter\u2019s proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former aide told me, \u201cHunter is super rich terrain.\u201d But Donald J. Trump and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Biden\u2019s candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice-President to advance and protect his son\u2019s interests. At the same time, the gossip pages have seized on Hunter\u2019s tumultuous private life. He has struggled for decades with alcohol addiction and drug abuse; he went through an acrimonious divorce from his first wife, Kathleen Buhle Biden; and he had a subsequent relationship with Beau\u2019s widow, Hallie. He was recently sued for child support by an Arkansas woman, Lunden Alexis Roberts, who claims that he is the father of her child. (Hunter has denied having sexual relations with Roberts.) On May 17th, the day before Hunter planned to appear at one of his father\u2019s rallies, at Eakins Oval, in Philadelphia, Breitbart News published a story based on a Prescott, Arizona, police report from 2016 that named Hunter as the suspect in a possible narcotics offense. Onstage at the rally, Jill Biden introduced her husband. \u201cThe Biden family is ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do this as we always have\u2014as a family.\u201d Seated in white chairs to the side of the stage were Ashley Biden, Hunter\u2019s half sister; Ashley\u2019s husband, Howard Krein; Beau\u2019s children, Natalie and Robert Hunter; Hunter\u2019s three daughters, Maisy, Finnegan, and Naomi; and Naomi\u2019s boyfriend, Peter. The last seat in the row, with a piece of paper on it that said \u201cReserved,\u201d remained empty. In one of my early conversations with Hunter, he told me about his sadness at having missed his father\u2019s event. \u201cBeau and I have been there since we were carried in baskets during his first campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went everywhere with him. At every single major event and every small event that had to do with his political career, I was there. I\u2019ve never missed a rally for my dad. The notion that I\u2019m not standing next to him in Philadelphia, next to the Rocky statue, it\u2019s heartbreaking for me. It\u2019s killing me and it\u2019s killing him. Dad says, \u2018Be here.\u2019 Mom says, \u2018Be here.\u2019 But at what cost?\u201d Hunter speaks in the warm, circuitous style of his father. Through weeks of conversations, he became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on \u201cHannity.\u201d He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. \u201cLook, everybody faces pain,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has trauma. There\u2019s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel\u2014it\u2019s a never-ending tunnel. You don\u2019t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.\u201d", "Hunter Biden was born in 1970, a year and a day after Beau and a year and nine months before their sister, Naomi. His father was twenty-seven, and won his first election, to the New Castle County Council, in November of that year. Two years later, in an immense leap of ambition, he decided to run for the U.S. Senate. Biden pledged that, in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, he would never own a stock or a bond. Whatever money he had, he spent on property. His father, Joseph Biden, Sr., managed a Chevrolet dealership in Wilmington, and Joe grew up in a house with his parents, his three siblings, his aunt Gertie, and two uncles. He tried to re-create this arrangement for his own family. He liked historic houses, and bought a center-hall Colonial, built in 1723, on a four-acre lot in the village of North Star, about thirty minutes west of Wilmington. \u201cThe large houses were a way for all of us, including aunts and uncles, to have something special,\u201d Hunter said. Joe Biden depended on his family to help staff his campaigns. His sister, Valerie, who taught at the Quaker day school Wilmington Friends, served as his campaign manager. His brother Jimmy oversaw fund-raising; Frankie, the youngest, helped organize volunteers. When the children were babies, Biden\u2019s wife, Neilia, carried them to community meetings. In November, 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate. That December, while Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office, Neilia took the children to Wilmington, to go Christmas-tree shopping. At an intersection, the family car collided with a truck. Neilia and Naomi were killed almost instantly. Beau sustained numerous broken bones, and Hunter suffered a severe head injury. Hunter has frequently said that his first memory is of waking up in a hospital bed next to Beau, who turned to him and said, \u201cI love you, I love you, I love you.\u201d On January 5, 1973, Biden was sworn in as a senator in his sons\u2019 hospital room. Valerie and Jimmy devoted themselves to the boys\u2019 recovery while Biden took up his role in the Senate. In 1975, he sold the North Star property, and the family moved into a house in Wilmington that had once been owned by members of the du Pont family. Biden, on returning from Washington, often put on a hazmat suit and went into the basement to scrape asbestos off the pipes. He, Hunter, and Beau planted trees and painted the house. Hunter told me that his father would dangle him upside down from the third-floor windows so that he could reach the eaves with a brush. So many people came and went that Tommy Lewis, an old friend of Biden\u2019s who became one of his Senate aides, nicknamed the house the Station. Hunter recalled, \u201cNo door was ever locked. The pool was everyone\u2019s pool.\u201d He and Beau were \u201ccommunal property,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone had a hand in raising us.\u201d In 1977, Joe Biden married Jill Jacobs, a high-school teacher. (Hunter calls Jill \u201cMom\u201d and refers to Neilia as \u201cMommy.\u201d) Biden frequently took the boys to Washington with him when Congress was in session. Roger Harrison, who worked in Biden\u2019s office for seven years, recalled that one of them often sat on Biden\u2019s lap during staff meetings. If he was busy on the Senate floor, another senator would take Hunter and Beau to his office to hang out. Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the boys would wander over to the Senate gym and sit in a corner of the steam room, eavesdropping on lawmakers. Beau and Hunter were fiercely close. They attended Archmere Academy, the Catholic high school that was their father\u2019s alma mater. Friends called Beau, a stickler for rules, the Sheriff. Hunter told me, \u201cIf we wanted to jump off a cliff into a watering hole, I would say, \u2018I\u2019m ready, let\u2019s go,\u2019 and Beau would say, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, before we do it, make sure there aren\u2019t any rocks down there.\u2019 \u201d Brian McGlinchey, a friend of Hunter\u2019s who attended Archmere with the brothers, said, \u201cBeau tended to lead with his head. Hunter often led with his heart.\u201d At Archmere, Beau, with the help of Hunter, who distributed flyers, was elected student-body president. It was clear to family and friends that Beau would follow his father into politics. \u201cDad knew that is what Beau wanted,\u201d Hunter said. Biden sold off some of the land at the Station to help pay for Beau to go to the University of Pennsylvania, in 1987. That year, Hunter and Beau encouraged their father to run for President, and they were crushed when he withdrew from the race over allegations of plagiarism. (He was accused of copying large portions of a law-review article as a student, and of mimicking a speech given by the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.) Soon afterward, when Biden took his sons to a football game at the University of Pennsylvania, a group of hecklers started a chant about the plagiarism scandal. Hunter jumped to his feet, throwing punches, and his father and Beau had to pull him back. Hunter enrolled at Georgetown University in 1988. He and Beau took out student loans to cover their university costs. Hunter worked odd jobs\u2014parking cars at events and unloading sixty-pound boxes of frozen beef\u2014to help pay for his room and board. Ted Dziak, a chaplain-in-residence in Hunter\u2019s freshman dorm, told me, \u201cHunter was always out there, doing something to gain a little bit of money.\u201d In July, 1992, after graduating with a B.A. in history, Hunter began a year as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon. During that time, he met Kathleen Buhle, the daughter of a Chicago schoolteacher and a ticket salesman for the White Sox. Three months after they started dating, Kathleen got pregnant, and the two were married in July, 1993. Beau attended Syracuse Law School, and began thinking about government service. Hunter imagined a more artistic career for himself. He admired Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff; his favorite novel at the time was Charles Bukowski\u2019s d\u00e9but, \u201cPost Office.\u201d On a whim, he applied to, and was accepted into, the creative-writing program at Syracuse University, where Carver and Wolff had taught. He considered getting a joint M.F.A.-law degree at Syracuse, but, with a baby on the way, he decided to go straight to law school. He was rejected from Yale, his first choice, and enrolled at Georgetown Law. In December, 1993, his daughter Naomi was born. After a year at Georgetown, Hunter transferred to Yale Law, where he completed his degree, in 1996. Then he returned to Wilmington with Kathleen and Naomi. Joe Biden was running for re\u00eblection in the Senate, and he appointed Hunter as his deputy campaign manager. Hunter rented an apartment close to his father\u2019s campaign headquarters, and also got a job as a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company based in Delaware, which was one of the largest donors to his father\u2019s campaigns. At the age of twenty-six, Hunter, who was earning more than a hundred thousand dollars and had received a signing bonus, was making nearly as much money as his father. In January, 1998, the conservative reporter and columnist Byron York wrote, in The American Spectator, \u201cCertainly lots of children of influential parents end up in very good jobs. But the Biden case is troubling. After all, this is a senator who for years has sermonized against what he says is the corrupting influence of money in politics.\u201d", "Hunter shared his father\u2019s love of old houses. In 1997, he bought a dilapidated estate in Wilmington, the original structure of which dated to before the Revolutionary War. The previous owner, Anna Sasso, recalled, \u201cThey seemed like the perfect family. They were teen-agers, practically. They were so enthusiastic.\u201d That year, Beau started working as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Philadelphia, and moved in with his brother\u2019s family, taking over the third floor. Hunter was responsible for the mortgage and most of the expenses. In September, 1998, Hunter and Kathleen had their second daughter, Finnegan. On weekends, the house was a gathering place for friends, including a local woman named Hallie Olivere, whose parents owned a dry-cleaning business. Beau and Hallie married in 2002. Hunter, by then an executive vice-president at MBNA, found the corporate culture stifling. \u201cIf you forgot to wear your MBNA lapel pin, someone would stop you in the halls,\u201d he recalled. In 1998, he contacted William Oldaker, a Washington lawyer who had worked on his father\u2019s Presidential campaign in 1987, for advice about how to get a job in the Clinton Administration. Oldaker called William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, who had also worked on Biden\u2019s campaign. Daley, the son of the five-term mayor of Chicago, told me that, because of their shared experience growing up in political families, he empathized with Hunter, and asked his staff to evaluate him for a position as a policy director specializing in the burgeoning Internet economy. Hunter got the job, then sold the Delaware house for roughly twice what he\u2019d paid for it and moved his family to a rental home in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. Hunter and Kathleen sent Naomi and Finnegan\u2014and later Maisy, who was born in 2000\u2014to Sidwell Friends, one of Washington\u2019s most exclusive and expensive schools. Hunter\u2019s salary barely covered the rent, the school fees, and his family\u2019s living expenses. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Hunter told me. \u201cI never considered it struggling, but it has always been a high-wire act.\u201d In late 2000, near the end of President Clinton\u2019s second term, Hunter again consulted Oldaker, who was starting a lobbying business, the National Group. Oldaker asked the co-founder of the firm, Vincent Versage, to teach Hunter the basics of earmarking\u2014the practice of persuading lawmakers to insert language into legislation which directs taxpayer funds to projects that benefit the lobbyist\u2019s clients. In 2001, Robert Skomorucha, an old Biden family friend who worked in the government-and-community-relations department at St. Joseph\u2019s University, proposed that Hunter solicit earmarks for one of the university\u2019s student-volunteer programs, at an underprivileged high school in Philadelphia. Timothy Lannon, the university\u2019s president, who offered Hunter the contract, described Hunter to me as \u201clike his dad: great personally, very engaging, very curious about things and hardworking,\u201d adding that he had \u201ca very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.\u201d Versage told me that the National Group had a strict rule: \u201cHunter didn\u2019t do anything that involved his dad, didn\u2019t do anything that involved any help from his dad.\u201d Oldaker advised Hunter to restrict his clients to mostly Jesuit universities. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t doing McDonnell Douglas or something,\u201d Oldaker told me. Still, Hunter\u2019s name appeared regularly in newspaper stories decrying the cozy relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. An informal arrangement was established: Biden wouldn\u2019t ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn\u2019t tell his father about them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we all sat down and agreed on it,\u201d Hunter told me. \u201cIt came naturally.\u201d", "Oldaker\u2019s office was across the street from the Bombay Club, an Indian restaurant that was popular with policymakers, lobbyists, diplomats, and journalists. The lounge there became an after-hours gathering place for Hunter, Versage, and a dozen of their colleagues. Irfan Ozarslan, the former general manager, said that he greeted Hunter at the door \u201cat least three or four times a week.\u201d The bartender at the time, Norman, told me that he would have a cigarette waiting for Hunter at his seat. \u201cYou miss so much with your face always buried in your phone.\u201d Joe Biden grew up around relatives with alcohol problems, and at a young age he decided to abstain. Hunter\u2014who spoke frankly to me about his struggles with addiction\u2014started drinking socially as a teen-ager. When he was a student at Georgetown, in the early nineties, he took up smoking Marlboro Red cigarettes, and occasionally used cocaine. Once, hoping to buy cocaine, he was sold a piece of crack, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to take the drug. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a stem,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a pipe.\u201d Improvising, he stuffed the crack into a cigarette and smoked it. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have much of an effect,\u201d he said. In 2001, Hunter, Kathleen, and their children moved back to Wilmington to be closer to the rest of the Biden family, and Hunter commuted to Washington on Amtrak, as his father did. Sometimes he missed the last train and stayed in a rental room at the Army and Navy Club. \u201cWhen I found myself making the decision to have another drink or get on a train, I knew I had a problem,\u201d he said. In 2003, Kathleen and the girls returned to Washington. Hunter recalled that Kathleen told him to get sober, starting by not drinking for thirty days. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t drink for thirty days, but, on day thirty-one, I\u2019d be right back to it,\u201d he said. That September, on a business trip, he looked up rehabilitation centers, and soon admitted himself to Crossroads Centre Antigua for a month. The day after his return, Beau accompanied him to his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, in Dupont Circle. By the mid-two-thousands, a growing number of lawmakers were criticizing earmarking as a waste of taxpayer money and a boon to special interests. Hunter was concerned about his future as a lobbyist, and his financial worries increased in 2006, when he bought a $1.6-million house in an affluent neighborhood. Without the savings for a down payment, he took out a mortgage for a hundred and ten per cent of the purchase price. In 2006, Hunter and his uncle Jimmy Biden, along with another partner, entered into a twenty-one-million-dollar deal to buy Paradigm, a hedge-fund group that claimed to manage $1.5 billion in assets. Hunter said that the deal sounded \u201csuper attractive,\u201d but that it fell apart after he and Jimmy learned that the company was worth less than they thought, and that the lawyer they were working with was a convicted felon awaiting sentencing. Hunter and Jimmy, who together went on to buy a stake in the company, estimated that they lost at least $1.3 million on the initial venture, which Hunter described as \u201ca tragicomedy.\u201d To help repay a law firm that had put up the money to initiate the transaction, Hunter obtained a million-dollar note against his house from Washington First Bank, which was co-founded by Oldaker. On January 5, 2007, two days before Biden announced his decision to run for President, Hunter and Jimmy were sued by their former partner in New York. The suit was settled but resulted in a flurry of headlines. In the lead-up to the January, 2008, Iowa Democratic Presidential caucuses, Hunter drove from Washington to Des Moines to campaign with his father. \u201cI\u2019m like his security blanket,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI don\u2019t tell the staff what to do. I\u2019m not there giving directions or orders. I shake everybody\u2019s hands. And then I tell him to close his eyes on the bus. I can say things to him that nobody else can.\u201d Biden did poorly in Iowa, and soon dropped out of the race. On August 23, 2008, Obama, the Democratic nominee, publicly introduced Biden as his running mate. He praised Beau, who had recently become Delaware\u2019s attorney general and was getting ready to deploy to Iraq with his National Guard unit. Hunter had heard that, during the primaries, some of Obama\u2019s advisers had criticized him to reporters for his earmarking work. Hunter said that he wasn\u2019t told by members of the Obama campaign to end his lobbying activities, but that he knew \u201cthe writing was on the wall.\u201d Hunter told his lobbying clients that he would no longer represent them, and resigned from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak, a role for which, Hunter said, the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid had tapped him. \u201cI wanted my father to have a clean slate,\u201d Hunter told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to limit him in any way.\u201d", "In September, 2008, Hunter launched a boutique consulting firm, Seneca Global Advisors, named for the largest of the Finger Lakes, in New York State, where his mother had grown up. In pitch meetings with prospective clients, Hunter said that he could help small and mid-sized companies expand into markets in the U.S. and other countries. In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator John Kerry\u2019s stepson and an heir to the food-company fortune, and Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model who started his finance career at Citibank in Asia and who had been friends with Heinz at Yale. (Heinz and Archer already had a private-equity fund called Rosemont Capital.) Heinz believed that Hunter would share his aversion to entering into business deals that could attract public scrutiny, but over time Hunter and Archer seized opportunities that did not include Heinz, who was less inclined to take risks. In 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital\u2014and, potentially, capital from other countries\u2014in companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR\u2019s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House. In December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping. Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation\u2019s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn\u2019t understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. \u201cHow do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?\u201d he said. Hunter\u2019s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Biden\u2019s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father\u2019s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter\u2019s behavior invited questions about whether he \u201cwas leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasn\u2019t done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.\u201d When I asked members of Biden\u2019s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. \u201cEveryone who works for him has been screamed at,\u201d a former adviser told me. Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, \u201cgot deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.\u201d For another venture, Archer travelled to Kiev to pitch investors on a real-estate fund he managed, Rosemont Realty. There, he met Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural-gas producers. Zlochevsky had served as ecology minister under the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych. After public protests in 2013 and early 2014, the Ukrainian parliament had voted to remove Yanukovych and called for his arrest. Under the new Ukrainian government, authorities in Kiev, with the encouragement of the Obama Administration, launched an investigation into whether Zlochevsky had used his cabinet position to grant exploration licenses that benefitted Burisma. (The status of the inquiry is unclear, but no proof of criminal activity has been publicly disclosed. Zlochevsky could not be reached for comment, and Burisma did not respond to queries.) In a related investigation, which was ultimately closed owing to a lack of evidence, British authorities temporarily froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky. In early 2014, Zlochevsky sought to assemble a high-profile international board to oversee Burisma, telling prospective members that he wanted the company to adopt Western standards of transparency. Among the board members he recruited was a former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, who had a reputation as a dedicated reformer. In early 2014, at Zlochevsky\u2019s suggestion, Kwa\u015bniewski met with Archer in Warsaw and encouraged him to join Burisma\u2019s board, arguing that the company was critical to Ukraine\u2019s independence from Russia. Archer agreed. When Archer told Hunter that the board needed advice on how to improve the company\u2019s corporate governance, Hunter recommended the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was \u201cof counsel.\u201d The firm brought in the investigative agency Nardello & Co. to assess Burisma\u2019s history of corruption. Hunter joined Archer on the Burisma board in April, 2014. Three months later, in a draft report to Boies Schiller, Nardello said that it was \u201cunable to identify any information to date regarding any current government investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma,\u201d but cited unnamed sources saying that Zlochevsky could be \u201cvulnerable to investigation for financial crimes\u201d and for \u201cperceived abuse of power.\u201d Vice-President Biden was playing a central role in overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine, and took the lead in calling on Kiev to fight rampant corruption. On May 13, 2014, after Hunter\u2019s role on the Burisma board was reported in the news, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a \u201cprivate citizen.\u201d Hunter told Burisma\u2019s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father. Kwa\u015bniewski told me, \u201cWe never discussed how the Vice-President can help us. Frankly speaking, we didn\u2019t need such help.\u201d Several former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter\u2019s role at Burisma had no effect on his father\u2019s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that \u201cHunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father\u2019s message.\u201d The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted \u201cto be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.\u201d A former business associate said, \u201cThe appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.\u201d In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter\u2019s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d", "Hunter was not always at ease as the son of the Vice-President. He asked that the Secret Service stop deploying agents to accompany him, a request that was eventually granted. He also became offended when he felt that his father wasn\u2019t treated respectfully enough by Obama and his advisers. In 2012, Biden, responding to a question about same-sex marriage on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable\u201d with all couples having the \u201cexact same rights.\u201d Obama had yet to publicly take a similar stance, and Biden\u2019s statement upset some White House officials. Hunter thought that Obama and his advisers should have acknowledged his father\u2019s good political instincts. \u201cYou must be the super!\u201d Hunter said that he limited his social interactions with Biden\u2019s White House colleagues, because he didn\u2019t want to be in a situation \u201cwhere I\u2019m playing golf with the President or one of his aides and look at my phone and see another headline that reads \u2018President Makes Joke About Biden.\u2019 \u201d Kathleen felt differently about the White House. Their daughter Maisy was in the same class at Sidwell Friends as Sasha, the Obamas\u2019 younger daughter. The two girls became close, and Kathleen and Michelle Obama became friends, attending SoulCycle and Solidcore exercise classes together almost every day. Some evenings, they went out to dinner or had drinks at the White House. Kathleen went on vacations with Michelle, mutual friends, and their daughters. Hunter saw himself as a provider for the Biden family; he even helped to pay off Beau\u2019s law-school debts. But he often wished that, like his father and his brother, he could contribute more to society. Through his business, he got to know an Australian-American former military-intelligence officer named Greg Keeley, who regaled him with stories about his career in the Royal Australian Navy. After moving to the United States, at forty, Keeley had obtained an age waiver to join the U.S. Navy as a reservist. While on reserve duty at a U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan on September 11, 2011, he and members of his unit watched Vice-President Biden deliver a speech at the Pentagon about the attacks of 9/11. After the speech, Keeley sent an e-mail to Hunter to tell him that members of his unit thought the Vice-President\u2019s message was \u201cspot on.\u201d Hunter passed the note on to his father, who wrote Keeley an e-mail. \u201cKeep your heads down,\u201d it said. \u201cYou are the finest group of warriors in all of history.\u201d Keeley helped convince Hunter that it wasn\u2019t too late for him to join the Navy Reserves. He told me, \u201cMy message to him was: If you feel the call to serve, which I encouraged, it doesn\u2019t really matter what your rank is and what\u2019s on your shoulder board\u2014it is that you\u2019re serving your country. Hunter took that message to heart and acted upon it.\u201d With a letter of recommendation from Keeley, Hunter applied for an age waiver, which the Navy granted. The service has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol-abuse policy, and states that all recruits will be asked \u201cquestions about prior drug and alcohol use.\u201d Hunter disclosed that he had \u201cused drugs in the past,\u201d but said that he was now sober, and the Navy granted him a second waiver. Hunter had suffered his first relapse, after seven years of sobriety, in November, 2010, when he drank three Bloody Marys on a flight home from a business trip to Madrid. He continued to drink in secret for several months, then confided in Beau and returned to Crossroads Centre. He had another relapse in early 2013, after he suffered from a bout of shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers. When the prescription ran out, he resumed drinking. On May 7, 2013, he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence, but was given a job in a public-affairs unit. In a small, private ceremony at the White House, Hunter was sworn in by his father. Later that month, the night before Hunter\u2019s first weekend of Reserve duty, he stopped at a bar a few blocks from the White House. Outside, Hunter said, he bummed a cigarette from two men who told him that they were from South Africa. He felt \u201camped up\u201d as he was driving down to Norfolk, and then \u201cincredibly exhausted.\u201d He told me that he called Beau and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Beau drove from Delaware to meet Hunter at a hotel near the naval station. \u201cHe got me shipshape and drove me into the base,\u201d he said. On his first day, Hunter had a urine sample taken for testing. A few months later, Hunter received a letter saying that his urinalysis had detected cocaine in his system. Under Navy rules, a positive drug test typically triggers a discharge. Hunter wrote a letter to the Navy Reserve, saying that he didn\u2019t know how the drug had got into his system and suggesting that the cigarettes he\u2019d smoked outside the bar might have been laced with cocaine. Hunter called Beau, who contacted Tom Gallagher, a former Navy lawyer who had worked with Beau at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Philadelphia. Gallagher agreed to represent Hunter pro bono, but it became clear that, given Hunter\u2019s history with drugs, an appeals panel was unlikely to believe the story that he had ingested cocaine involuntarily, and that appealing the decision would require closed-door hearings and the testimony of witnesses, increasing the likelihood of leaks to the press. Hunter decided not to appeal. Navy records show that Hunter\u2019s discharge took effect on February 18, 2014. Hunter did not tell anyone except his father and his brother about the reason for his discharge, and he tried to get his drinking under control. In July, 2014, he went to a clinic in Tijuana that provided a treatment using ibogaine, a psychoactive alkaloid derived from the roots of a West African shrub, which is illegal in America. Hunter then drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where he met with Thom Knoles, a practitioner of Vedic meditation, who said that he advised Hunter to meditate twice a day, to help keep \u201chis cravings for alcohol at bay.\u201d Knoles said that Hunter struck him as \u201cjust a good man.\u201d He was \u201cnearly clean,\u201d Knoles said. \u201cBut, to be honest, there is such a thing as a dry drunk. I could see that he was in a very delicate position.\u201d Knoles said that Hunter told him about how much he relied on Beau for support and confessed that \u201chis relationship with his other great, deep partner in life, his wife, had been brutalized by him through his loss of control.\u201d That fall, Hunter went to Big Sur, California, to attend a twelve-step yoga retreat at the Esalen Institute. Toward the end of his week there, a reporter from the Wall Street Journal contacted the Vice-President\u2019s office, seeking comment on Hunter\u2019s discharge from the Navy. At San Francisco International Airport, Hunter was waiting for his flight home when he saw the story on the front page of the Journal. \u201cI was heartbroken,\u201d he said.", "In the summer of 2013, Hunter, Beau, and their families took a vacation together on Lake Michigan. During the trip, Beau became disoriented and was rushed to the hospital. He\u2019d had a health scare in May, 2010, when\u2014six months after he returned from Iraq\u2014he suffered a stroke. He had appeared to recover quickly, and continued to work as Delaware\u2019s attorney general, but he struggled to remember certain words, and sometimes talked about hearing music playing when there was none. Soon after Beau\u2019s admittance to the hospital, doctors identified a mass in his brain. It was glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain tumor. Patients who receive similar diagnoses tend to live no longer than two years. As Beau received radiation treatment, his motor and speech skills started to decline. In the spring of 2015, he underwent an experimental procedure in which an engineered virus was injected directly into the tumor, but it was unsuccessful. In late May, doctors removed Beau\u2019s tracheostomy tube, telling the family that he would likely die within a few hours. Beau kept breathing on his own for almost a day and a half before he died, surrounded by his family. On June 6, 2015, thousands of people paid their respects at a service at St. Anthony of Padua Church, in Wilmington. The next day, President Obama, Ashley Biden, and Hunter, who was fearful of public speaking, delivered eulogies. On the drive back to Washington, Hunter\u2014moved by the outpouring of support for him and his family at the funeral\u2014told Kathleen that he was thinking about running for public office. She pointed out that he had only recently been discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine. They rode the rest of the way home in silence. (Kathleen declined to comment for this article.) In couples therapy, Hunter and Kathleen had reached an agreement: if Hunter started drinking again, he would have to move out of the house. A day after their twenty-second anniversary, Hunter left a therapy session, drank a bottle of vodka, and moved out. Later that month, Zlochevsky, the Burisma co-founder, invited him to Norway on a fishing trip. Hunter brought along Maisy and Beau\u2019s nine-year-old son, Robert. Hunter said that, every night, he and his colleagues on the trip drank a single shot of liquor before going to bed. Kathleen found out and was angry. Hunter began to confide in Hallie, whom he was growing closer to. Hunter said that, in July, 2015, \u201cI tried to show Kathleen: I want back in.\u201d He enrolled as an outpatient in the Charles O\u2019Brien Center for Addiction Treatment, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was prescribed two drugs, one to lessen his cravings and another to make him feel nauseated if he drank. He then enrolled in an inpatient program for executives at Caron Treatment Centers, where he used the pseudonym Hunter Smith. On returning to Washington, he began a program that required him to carry a Breathalyzer with a built-in camera. That summer, Ashley Madison, a dating service for married people\u2014which used the slogan \u201cLife is short. Have an affair\u201d\u2014disclosed that hackers had breached its user data. In late August, Breitbart reported that it had found a \u201cRobert Biden\u201d profile among the leaked files. Hunter denied that the account belonged to him, but Kathleen was deeply embarrassed by the story. Two months later, Hunter and Kathleen agreed to formally separate. On October 21, 2015, Joe Biden appeared in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Jill and Obama, and announced that he would not run for President in 2016, talking about the time that it had taken the family to recover from Beau\u2019s death. Until mid-December, Hunter practiced yoga daily. A teacher from his yoga studio told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a person try as hard to heal as he did.\u201d When Hunter stopped coming to class, the teacher went to his apartment, near Logan Circle, and knocked on the door. Hunter told me that he pretended not to be at home. For weeks, he said, he left the apartment only to buy bottles of Smirnoff vodka at Logan Circle Liquor. Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was O.K. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment. Hunter said that his father told him, \u201cI need you. What do we have to do?\u201d In February, 2016, Hunter went back to the Esalen Institute, and then spent a week skiing by himself at Lake Tahoe. When he returned to Washington, he enrolled in yet another addiction-treatment program, run by the Kolmac Outpatient Recovery Center. On his way to Kolmac, he passed several homeless people, including a middle-aged woman who went by the name Bicycles, because of the bike she took with her everywhere. Later, whenever Hunter saw Bicycles near his apartment, he would give her a twenty-dollar bill to buy him a pack of Marlboro Reds and tell her to keep the change. One rainy night, Hunter said, he offered Bicycles his spare bedroom, and she stayed for several months.", "In 2016, Hunter was consulting for five or six major clients. Once or twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that took place in Europe. He said that, in June, 2016, while in Monte Carlo for a meeting, he went to a hotel night club and used cocaine that a stranger offered him in the bathroom. He told his counsellors at Kolmac about his relapse but refused to take a drug test, out of concern that the results could be used against him and published in the press. When Kolmac\u2019s staff insisted that he take the test, he decided to leave the program. \u201cAt this age, you\u2019re lucky if any of your close friends have been born yet.\u201d In August, Hunter and Hallie went to the Hamptons with Hallie\u2019s children. They texted constantly after getting back, and Hunter started to spend most nights in Delaware, at Hallie\u2019s house, watching television until very late. \u201cWe were sharing a very specific grief,\u201d Hunter recalled. \u201cI started to think of Hallie as the only person in my life who understood my loss.\u201d That fall, Hunter made plans to go to the Grace Grove Lifestyle Center, in Sedona, Arizona. During a layover at Los Angeles International Airport, before his connecting flight to Phoenix, he went to a nearby hotel bar and realized that he had left his wallet on the plane. It had belonged to Beau and still contained his attorney-general identification badge, and also Hunter\u2019s driver\u2019s license, without which he couldn\u2019t board his flight. Using a credit card he had in his pocket, Hunter checked into a hotel in Marina del Rey, where he waited for the airline to return the wallet. Instead of going to Grace Grove, Hunter stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. He said that he \u201cneeded a way to forget,\u201d and that, soon after his arrival in L.A., he asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter said that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment, where, in a narrow passageway between tents, someone put a gun to his head before realizing that he was a buyer. He returned to buy more crack a few times that week. One night, outside a club on Hollywood Boulevard, Hunter and another man got into an argument, and a group of bouncers intervened. A friend of one of the bouncers, a Samoan man who went by the nickname Baby Down, felt sorry for Hunter and took him to Mel\u2019s Drive-In to get some food, and to his hotel to pick up his belongings. Early on the morning of October 26th, Baby Down dropped Hunter off at the Hertz rental office at Los Angeles International Airport. Hunter said that, at that point, he had not slept for several days. Driving east on Interstate 10, just beyond Palm Springs, he lost control of his car, which jumped the median and skidded to a stop on the shoulder of the westbound side. He called Hertz, which came to collect the damaged car and gave him a second rental. Later, on a sharp bend on a mountainous road, Hunter recalled, a large barn owl flew over the hood of the car and then seemed to follow him, dropping in front of the headlights. He said that he has no idea whether the owl was real or a hallucination. On the night of October 28th, Hunter dropped the car off at a Hertz office in Prescott, Arizona, and Grace Grove sent a van to pick him up. Zachary Romfo, who worked at the Hertz office in Prescott, told me that he found a crack pipe in the car and, on one of the consoles, a line of white-powder residue. Beau Biden\u2019s attorney-general badge was on the dashboard. Hertz called the Prescott police department, and officers there filed a \u201cnarcotics offense\u201d report, listing the items seized from the car, including a plastic baggie containing a \u201cwhite powdery substance,\u201d a Secret Service business card, credit cards, and Hunter\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Later, according to a police report, Secret Service agents informed Prescott police that Hunter was \u201csecure/well.\u201d Subsequent test results indicated that the glass pipe contained cocaine residue, but investigators didn\u2019t find any fingerprints on it. Public prosecutors in the county and the city declined to bring a case against Hunter, citing a lack of evidence that the pipe had been used by him. Jon Paladini, Prescott\u2019s city attorney, told me that he was not aware of any requests by officials in Washington to drop the investigation into Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s a very Republican area,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think political favors, necessarily, would even work, had they been requested.\u201d After a week at Grace Grove, Hunter checked into a resort spa called Mii Amo, and called Hallie, who flew to meet him. During her stay, Hunter said, they decided to become a couple. When they returned to Delaware, they tried, unsuccessfully, to keep their relationship secret. On December 9, 2016, Kathleen filed for divorce, and on February 23, 2017, she filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunter\u2019s assets, alleging that he \u201ccreated financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.\u201d The motion was leaked to the New York Post, along with the revelation that Hunter and Hallie were dating. Kathleen told friends that she felt ostracized by the Biden family. Hunter denied hiring prostitutes, and said that he hadn\u2019t been to a strip club in years. But, he said, the evening the story was published, \u201cI went directly to a strip club. I said, \u2018Fuck them.\u2019 \u201d The first that Biden heard of the relationship was when the Post asked his office for comment. Hunter issued a statement saying that he and Hallie were \u201cincredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time.\u201d Hunter told me he appealed to his father to make a statement, too: \u201cI said, \u2018Dad, Dad, you have to.\u2019 He said, \u2018Hunter, I don\u2019t know if I should. But I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do.\u2019 I said, \u2018Dad, if people find out, but they think you\u2019re not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong. The kids have to know, Dad, that there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you.\u2019 \u201d A former Biden aide confirmed that Biden agreed to issue a statement because of concerns about Hunter\u2019s well-being. Biden told the Post, \u201cWe are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. . . . They have mine and Jill\u2019s full and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d The Post ran the statement under the headline \u201cBeau Biden\u2019s Widow Having Affair with His Married Brother.\u201d In August, Hunter rented a house in Annapolis, Maryland, where he, Hallie, and her two children hoped to have some privacy, but, several months later, they split up. \u201cAll we got was shit from everybody, all the time,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt was really hard. And I realized that I\u2019m not helping anybody by sticking around.\u201d (Hallie declined to comment.) In early 2018, he moved to Los Angeles. The idea, he said, was to \u201ccompletely disappear.\u201d Hunter said that, in divorce proceedings, he offered to give Kathleen \u201ceverything,\u201d including a monthly payment of thirty-seven thousand dollars for alimony, tuition, and child-care costs for a decade. Hunter told me that he was living on approximately four thousand dollars a month; he was hardly poor, but it was an adjustment. On occasion, transactions on his credit cards were declined. One of Kathleen\u2019s motions contains a reference to \u201ca large diamond\u201d that had come into Hunter\u2019s possession. The motion seems to imply that it was one of Hunter\u2019s \u201cpersonal indulgences.\u201d When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars. Hunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye\u2019s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter\u2019s hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. \u201cI was, like, Oh, my God,\u201d Hunter said. (In Kathleen\u2019s court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: \u201cWhat would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn\u2019t in office.\u201d Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesn\u2019t know what they did with it. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,\u201d he said. Hunter began negotiating a deal for CEFC to invest forty million dollars in a liquefied-natural-gas project on Monkey Island, in Louisiana, which, he said, was projected to create thousands of jobs. \u201cI was more proud of it than you can imagine,\u201d he told me. In the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a \u201cshady character at all,\u201d and characterized the outcome as \u201cbad luck.\u201d", "Joe Biden is hardly the first politician to have faced scrutiny for the business dealings of a family member. In 1973, during the Watergate investigation, the Washington Post reported that Richard Nixon had the phone of his brother Donald tapped for at least a year, because he feared that Donald\u2019s \u201cvarious financial activities might bring embarrassment to the Nixon administration.\u201d In the late seventies, the F.B.I. investigated President Jimmy Carter\u2019s younger brother, Billy, after it emerged that he was on the payroll of the Libyan government. In an extensive report on the affair issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Biden was a member, Billy was quoted as saying that \u201che did not need anyone in Washington telling him how to conduct his private business.\u201d Carter said that he had tried, unsuccessfully, to \u201cdiscourage Billy from making any other trip to Libya\u201d and \u201cto keep him out of the newspapers for a few weeks.\u201d Hunter Biden and Melissa Cohen on the roof deck in L.A. where they were married. Photograph by Philip Montgomery for The New Yorker Biden\u2019s approach was to deal with Hunter\u2019s activities by largely ignoring them. This may have temporarily allowed Biden to truthfully inform reporters that his decisions were not affected by Hunter. But, as Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter\u2019s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter\u2019s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.\u201d It is clear that Hunter and Biden\u2019s decades-old decision not to discuss business matters has exposed both father and son to attacks. (Biden declined to comment for this article.) In March of last year, Peter Schweizer, a conservative researcher and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart, published \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.\u201d Schweizer is best known for \u201cClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Clinton Rich,\u201d which was released in May, 2015. Research for that book was funded by the Government Accountability Institute, which Schweizer co-founded, in 2012, with Stephen Bannon. Under the law, the G.A.I. is a nonpartisan organization. But, as Joshua Green wrote, in \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d his book about Bannon\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s rise, Bannon saw \u201cClinton Cash\u201d as \u201cthe key to orchestrating Hillary Clinton\u2019s downfall.\u201d It was, Green writes, \u201cthe culmination of everything Bannon learned during his time in Goldman Sachs, Internet Gaming Entertainment, Hollywood, and Breitbart News.\u201d As Bannon and Schweizer had hoped, investigative journalists from the mainstream press followed up on Schweizer\u2019s many examples of the Clintons\u2019 purported conflicts of interest. In April, 2015, two weeks before Schweizer\u2019s book came out, the Times published a front-page article, by Jo Becker and Mike McIntire, that cited Schweizer\u2019s research alongside Becker\u2019s own reporting from 2008. The article singled out a Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra, who donated tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The story suggested that the donations of Giustra and others might have created conflicts of interest, at a time when the Obama Administration was negotiating to allow the Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to gain control of a swath of America\u2019s untapped uranium deposits by purchasing the Canadian company Uranium One. The Times was criticized for building on Schweizer\u2019s work, and, two years later, Eileen Sullivan, in another Times article, wrote, \u201cThere has been no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced the Uranium One deal.\u201d Still, \u201cClinton Cash\u201d did exactly what Bannon hoped it would do, Green writes, \u201csullying Clinton\u2019s image in a way that she never fully recovered from.\u201d \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d which details Hunter\u2019s activities in China and Ukraine, focusses on what Schweizer calls \u201ccorruption by proxy,\u201d which he defines as a \u201cnew corruption\u201d that is \u201cdifficult to detect\u201d and that, though often legal, makes \u201cgood money for a politician and his family and friends\u201d and leaves \u201cAmerican politicians vulnerable to overseas financial pressure.\u201d Schweizer often relies on innuendo to supplement his reporting. At one point, he describes \u201cone of the few public sightings\u201d of Hunter in Beijing, when Hunter, \u201cdressed in a dark overcoat,\u201d followed Biden into a shop to buy a Magnum ice cream. \u201cIntentionally or not,\u201d Schweizer writes, \u201cHunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had guanxi\u201d\u2014connections. Schweizer asserts that \u201cRosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.\u201d In fact, the deal had been signed before the trip\u2014according to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterward\u2014and Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasn\u2019t with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was \u201clucrative\u201d for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company.", "In October, 2017, the special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, indicted Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, on twelve counts, including committing conspiracy against the United States by failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine. (Manafort pleaded guilty to that charge in September, 2018.) Making a case that Hunter had his own Ukrainian scandal, Schweizer implies that Joe Biden had been consulted in advance about Hunter and Archer\u2019s work with Burisma. On April 16, 2014, he notes, shortly before the announcement that Hunter and Archer had taken seats on the company\u2019s board, Archer made a \u201cprivate visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice-President Biden.\u201d Hunter, Archer, and Archer\u2019s son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-President\u2019s hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed. Rudolph Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has also aggressively promoted what he has called the \u201calleged Ukraine conspiracy\u201d in interviews and on social media. Giuliani told me that, in the fall of 2018, he spoke to Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general. Shokin told him that Vice-President Biden had him fired in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma and the company\u2019s payments to Hunter and Archer. Giuliani said that, in January, 2019, he met with Yurii Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s current prosecutor general, in New York, and Lutsenko confirmed Shokin\u2019s version of events. On April 1, 2019, John Solomon, an opinion contributor to The Hill, wrote about Shokin\u2019s claim that he had been conducting a corruption probe into Burisma and Hunter when he was dismissed. A month later, the Times reported that Hunter \u201cwas on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\u201d The story, by Kenneth P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel, provoked some Democrats to express concern that the Times was again lending credence to allegations made by Schweizer and other Trump allies. Giuliani retweeted the article, and Trump called for the Justice Department to investigate. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Obama, tweeted, \u201cZero lessons have been learned from 2016: 1. Mainstream outlet credulously accepts Trump conspiracy about opponent 2. Trump propaganda machine uses story to spread the conspiracy on social media and through digital ads 3. Voters believe it, ignoring subsequent fact checks.\u201d There is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokin\u2019s removal in order to protect Hunter. According to Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, Shokin was removed because of concerns by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the U.S. government that he wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption investigations. Contrary to the assertions that Shokin was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Zlochevsky, Hochstein said, \u201cmany of us in the U.S. government believed that Shokin was the one protecting Zlochevsky.\u201d In May, Giuliani scheduled a visit to Ukraine, and told the Times that he would look into Hunter\u2019s involvement with Burisma, \u201cbecause that information will be very, very helpful to my client,\u201d but then abruptly cancelled the trip, amid reports that Ukraine\u2019s President-elect was unwilling to meet with him. A week later, on May 16th, Lutsenko appeared to shift his position on Burisma, telling Bloomberg News that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, and that \u201ca company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d The reasons for his reversal were unclear, but Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, in Kiev, speculated that Lutsenko, in talking with Giuliani, had been trying to \u201cpump his political muscle,\u201d a strategy that had proved ineffective in the new political climate. That month, Hunter declined Burisma\u2019s offer to serve another term on the board, believing that the controversy had become a distraction. But he said that he was proud of his work there, and that he thought the criticism was misplaced. \u201cI feel the decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me,\u201d he told me. \u201cWas it worth it? Was it worth the pain? No. It certainly wasn\u2019t worth the grief.\u201d He went on, \u201cI would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.\u201d And yet, to many voters, the controversy over Hunter\u2019s business dealings will appear to have been avoidable, a product of Biden\u2019s resistance to having difficult conversations, particularly those involving his family. Hunter said that, in his talks with his father, \u201cI\u2019m saying sorry to him, and he says, \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry,\u2019 and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, \u2018Look, it\u2019s going to go away.\u2019 There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away.
