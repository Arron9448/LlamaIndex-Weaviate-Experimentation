Hamad\u2019s hometown has been fought over by the Syrian opposition, Islamic State, US-backed Kurdish forces and, now, Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxy fighters.", "\u201cI decided to return since my house wasn\u2019t destroyed and there\u2019s still furniture left that wasn\u2019t stolen,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cI am trying to find a job now. I\u2019ve heard that the schools are going to open soon. I hope so, because both my children are in elementary school and I want them to pursue their education.\u201d", "Hamad and his family fled the fighting in Syria in 2014, and have returned from Sanliurfa in Turkey voluntarily. But human rights monitors believe that those moving back of their own accord are in the minority \u2013 and that the so-called safe zone carved out by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s October invasion of the border strip is anything but.", "On Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan told the Global Refugee Forum in Geneva that 371,000 Syrians had already chosen to leave Turkey to move into the 32km-deep strip between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad, and that he expected another 600,000 to follow imminently, reflecting a pattern established by previous Turkish offensives in Afrin and Jarablus.", "The figure was disputed by Sara Kayyali, a Syria researcher with Human Rights Watch.", "\u201cThere are many obstacles to return for Syrians, and the ethnic angle here makes it even more difficult to verify whether these numbers are accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve seen so far, some people are being allowed to travel freely and others are not. That\u2019s on top of violations such as looting and arbitrary arrests, the repeat of thuggish behaviours we saw in Afrin.\u201d", "Ankara\u2019s heavily criticised border operation was designed to clear the area of previously US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters that Turkey says are linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). But the offensive has a secondary, equally important goal: under intense domestic pressure to solve Turkey\u2019s refugee crisis, Ankara has said up to 2 million of the country\u2019s 3.6 million Syrian refugees will be repatriated to the safe zone.", "The bulk would be Arab Syrians originally from Aleppo, Deir Ezzor and other areas where the Syrian regime has regained control, leaving people afraid to return to their homes.", "The proposed influx of newcomers into the relatively small 2,000-sq-mile area now under Turkish control has been met with allegations of demographic engineering and ethic cleansing from rights groups and local Kurds, who say Turkey\u2019s Syrian proxy fighters have forced Kurdish families from their homes and accuse them of looting, burning and confiscating farmland and businesses.", "Despite ceasefire deals brokered by the US and Russia, intermittent fighting in the form of shoot-outs, shelling and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) blamed on both sides continues.", "The UN said an additional 75,000 people inside Syria who fled the border fighting remain displaced from their homes, although 117,000 have managed to return to areas now under Turkish control.", "The latest upheaval leaves many Syrian families facing new dilemmas. \u201cMy family are split on this issue,\u201d said Fatima, a Syrian originally from the contested town of Manbij now living in the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s promise of $26bn for schools and hospitals in the area was unlikely to materalise, she said.", "\u201cMy father would love to go back home, our town and our house mean a lot to him. But based on previous repatriation efforts to places like Jarablus I just don\u2019t believe we could be safe there. I don\u2019t want my children growing up in an environment like that. These people are mercenaries, not the Free Syrian Army [opposition umbrella] we used to know. I don\u2019t want these factions pressuring them to fight when they\u2019re old enough.\u201d", "Turkey\u2019s latest repatriation efforts are also dogged by allegations it began a large campaign to forcibly deport Syrians over the summer in a violation of both domestic and international law regarding refugee protection.", "Amnesty International said that between July to September this year hundreds of refugees were compelled to return home, some in handcuffs, after receiving threats of violence or being tricked into signing \u201cvoluntary return\u201d agreements. Others were told they were signing a registration document, a confirmation of having received a blanket from a detention centre, or a form that expressed their desire to remain in Turkey.", "Many Syrians living in Turkey without up-to-date paperwork fear that if they are caught up in another police crackdown they too could be forced home against their will.", "\u201cEven if we went back, Turkish-controlled Syria is just as expensive as Turkey now and you\u2019d still make Syrian wages,\u201d said Milad, who lives in Gaziantep. \u201cA Turkish residency card is worth its weight in gold now. It\u2019s all those people here illegally or still living in camps who are the most vulnerable ones.
