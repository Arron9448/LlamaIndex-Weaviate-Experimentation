Others called him condescending, equating his statement to the men who praise their stay-at-home wives for doing \u201cthe most important job in the world\u201d.", "Would it be uncouth to say that Obama has become \u2026 a centrist dad? Who lectures people with extremely mundane, unsolicited opinions?", "1. When he told Black Lives Matter to stop yelling", "In 2016, Obama met young people in Europe and was asked whether his administration had gone far enough in tackling racial profiling. Instead of answering the question, Obama turned his attention towards the Black Lives Matter movement.", "\u201cOnce you\u2019ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people\u2019s attention \u2026 then you can\u2019t just keep on yelling at them,\u201d Obama said.", "And so, the president who ran on a campaign promising people \u201cYes, we can\u201d was using his platform to criticize a campaign group working to highlight the how routinely American police shoot and kill unarmed black men.", "2. When he complained about woke culture", "When Obama took the stage to talk down to young people in October, it was almost too easy to agree with him. The world is messy, he said, so we should be more careful about our tendency to \u201ccancel\u201d people online \u2013 especially if our judgment is replacing real action.", "Which all sounds fair enough. But0 then came his central message: that change is incremental. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely remake society in a minute. This idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke \u2026 you should get over that quickly,\u201d he said.", "There is a term for older people who benefitted from the boom and are now criticising young people for wanting change too quickly, and I think it\u2019s: OK boomer.", "3. When he said America was not ready for real change", "In November, Obama \u2013 who now has a net worth of $70m \u2013 stood up in front of a room of similarly wealthy people to reassure them that the system doesn\u2019t need to be radically changed.", "\u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Obama said at the annual Democracy Alliance meeting, attended by wealthy liberal donors. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d", "Perhaps Americans wanting radical change should re-think their approach. Get ready to lean in to good health insurance, everybody!", "4. When he bragged about helping oil companies", "At a Rice University gala in 2018, Obama took credit for the oil and gas boom in America. \u201cIt went up every year I was president. Suddenly America\u2019s the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas. That was me, people, say thank you,\u201d he said.", "Oil production grew 88% under Obama\u2019s two terms. The US is also one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels, and the planet is literally burning \u2013 so this is not exactly something to be proud of, but credit where credit is due, I guess.", "5. When he said he\u2019d stand up to stop Sanders", "Obama has said he would support any Democratic nominee for president in 2020. But judging by a Politico report from November, he doesn\u2019t include Bernie Sanders in that list. The piece quoted close sources to him who said that Obama has refrained from speaking out against Bernie so far because Sanders doesn\u2019t look like a credible threat.", "But privately, Politico reported, Obama has vowed to \u201cspeak up to stop him\u201d if it looks like Sanders has a proper shot at winning the nomination."], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["oil", "ultimate", "president", "sanders", "ok", "took", "young", "youre", "boomer", "dad", "barack", "noor", "doesnt", "obama", "centrist", "stop", "poppy", "say"], "id": "616ad545-e03a-381f-874b-d2cc5f18a677", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "title": "OK boomer: how Barack Obama became the ultimate centrist dad | Poppy Noor"}
