Photograph from AP", "Unavailability exacts two interrelated tolls on works of art: neglect and misunderstanding. If few can access a work, then it is seldom discussed, and, if it does finally become available, and earns overdue appreciation, it is often the victim of a rush to judgment that leaves the best parts of the artist\u2019s inspiration overlooked. This problem recently came back to mind when I received a cherished Christmas present from my daughters: a rare first edition (and there is, to date, no second one) of \u201cA Cage for Lovers,\u201d the novel, from 1957, by Dawn Powell, which exemplifies the misdirection and vagaries of artistic reputation. It is Powell\u2019s penultimate novel, and the only of her later ones that hasn\u2019t been republished. This is especially dismaying given that \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d shows Powell in her full artistic maturity, and thrusts her most daring artistic tendencies into the foreground. Over and above its urgent dramatic plot, the book connects with the most advanced ideas of Powell\u2019s time and suggests a leap, or a launching, that circumstances never allowed her to realize.", "The failure to recognize the distinctive merits of \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d replicates the peculiar and disturbing fate of Powell\u2019s literary career over all. Born in Mount Gilead, Ohio, in 1896, she moved to New York in 1918 and wrote fifteen novels in her lifetime (plus a handful of plays and a batch of short stories), but they didn\u2019t sell well. Her advances were scant, and her financial difficulties\u2014exacerbated by the cost of care for her son, who was mentally ill, her own medical issues (including an enormous albeit benign thoracic tumor), and the alcoholism of her husband\u2014were harrowing. In 1936, she was summoned to Hollywood with a lucrative screenwriting offer, but she quit after a month and returned to New York. (She may have spared herself the sort of agony that F. Scott Fitzgerald found in the movie business, but her rush back East doubtless cost the world some of the greatest fictions on the lives led in and around the studios.) From the thirties on, she was a New York literary notable, a friend of Ernest Hemingway (who admired her work, and became a character in Powell\u2019s \u201cTurn, Magic Wheel,\u201d from 1936) and of Edmund Wilson, perhaps the most acclaimed literary critic of the time. But her commercial fortunes were so desperate that, in 1958, when Powell was sixty-two years old, she and her husband were ejected from their Greenwich Village apartment (it went co-op and they were renters). In her last years, she lived on the largesse of a wealthy friend. By the time of her death, in 1965, at the age of sixty-eight, her work had fallen into oblivion.", "Powell was brought to wider attention only in 1987, by Gore Vidal, in the New York Review of Books, after which she became the subject of the devoted and discerning attention of Tim Page, who wrote a biography of Powell and edited a collection of her letters and a book of her diary entries. (Rachel Syme detailed Page\u2019s subsequent travails here, in 2012.) As a result, a dozen of Powell\u2019s novels have been brought back into print, nine of them in a pair of Library of America volumes. Yet she is nonetheless burdened by the reputation for which she has been belatedly acclaimed\u2014as a great social and comic novelist, as a satirist (a title that she herself modestly claimed)\u2014which stands like a screen to block the view of her genius and deflect the vast power of her art.", "\u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d is the story of a young woman named Christine (Tina) Drummond, from a small town in upstate New York, who works as the personal assistant and factotum to a rich and not quite elderly woman, Lesley Patterson. Lesley has grown so accustomed to Tina\u2019s services that, when the young woman had previously left the job, she sent detectives to find and fetch her. Now Tina has fled again\u2014this time to Paris, from a French country villa where she and Lesley have been staying\u2014and is taking careful, fearful, even frantic measures to evade any potential pursuers and reclaim her independence. Most of the novel is set in Paris\u2014and most of Tina\u2019s time in Paris is spent alone, walking the streets, thinking of the past, doubting the future, and paranoiacally trying to remain invisible and unidentifiable while hiding out in plain sight. \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d is a book about the fretful and punctilious social codes\u2014of personal and familial responsibility, of elaborate politeness and the ominous threat of scandal\u2014that have held Tina in a grip even stronger than the one that Lesley exerts, and of Tina\u2019s efforts to discover herself through, and liberate herself from, its tangle of delusions. It\u2019s a philosophical novel disguised as a social romance in which the social dynamics, the fine points of behavior and the fine observations of motives, are magnified to a symbolic dimension\u2014and to a horrific cycle of self-punishment and self-deception. (Even its romantic element seems mainly a conceptual inquiry on the nature of love.)", "Throughout her career, Powell had three main subjects\u2014her native Ohio, her adoptive New York, and their intersection in the form of small-town Midwesterners trying to make their names and fortunes in the city. The Parisian setting and, for that matter, the choice of an East Coast protagonist set \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d apart from the rest of her \u0153uvre. So does the book\u2019s brisk and chilled tone, the febrile fa\u00e7ade of breeziness disguising its bleak depths; unlike many of Powell\u2019s other books, it is not a comic novel\u2014and Powell even hoped that its lack of humor might help its commercial prospects. But \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d doesn\u2019t so much depart from Powell\u2019s work in her earlier novels as shift its emphasis, because, throughout her career, far from being primarily a novelist of middle-class manners, Powell was a master of literary psychology, of inwardness, of thought. Her novels depict introspection at a level of insight and imagination comparable to that of Dostoyevsky or Henry James; like them, she can go on for pages of unbroken text in detailing those states of mind and their labyrinthine intricacies. In \u201cA Cage for Lovers,\u201d which is spare in texture but dark in tone, the interior musings\u2014including skeins of imaginary dialogue\u2014are shorter but plunge deeper faster and rise again to the surface in a dizzying rush.", "Whereas James was a psycho-pointillist, blurring the boundaries of personality in the infinite nuances of social connection, and Dostoyevsky a writer of infernal flamboyance and hallucinatory ecstasy, Powell relied on the gaiety of Broadway colors, the charming artifice of lighting and clothing and d\u00e9cor. She saw social life as a theatre, in which people were cast into roles by the force of expectations. The struggle to discern one\u2019s distinctive selfhood through the barriers of social representations, whether those inculcated in childhood or adopted in adulthood, was the core of her satirical temperament. She created characters who exude a theatrical recognizability, a cinematic plausibility\u2014and then invested them with depths of feeling, understanding, and energy that reflect, above all, her own vitality, complexity, and refinement. She saw through the solid fa\u00e7ades of real-life stock characters and invested them with rarefied and profound sensibilities, even ones that they themselves may only dimly discern. If she understood herself as a satirist, it might be because she had an original and personal conception of the term. She wrote in her diary, in 1936, that romanticism is \u201cpeople as they would like to be,\u201d and realism \u201cpeople as they seem with their insides left out.\u201d Satire, she wrote, \u201cis people as they are\u201d\u2014with their inner lives detailed as fully as their outer ones are depicted.", "Powell\u2019s books often got favorable, even admiring reviews, but the good press didn\u2019t help. Like all of her other novels, \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d sold poorly, and this time she blamed her publishing house, Houghton Mifflin, which had compelled her to revise the book significantly; the editors forced her to add a lengthy flashback to the protagonist\u2019s youth in her home town and cut back on the Paris scenes, out of fear, as Powell put it, that the novel would be just \u201canother Paris Left Bank sort of book\u201d\u2014which is exactly what Powell meant it to be. Indeed, there is something crucially French about \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d which goes beyond its setting and links it to the leading French intellectual currents of the time. With its subjectivity and solitude, its identity quest and self-effacement, \u201cA Cage for Lovers\u201d is essentially an existential novel, offering a vision of bleakness and blankness, with a sort of cosmic opacity that Christine, in the course of her journey to nowhere, recognizes. Christine fears \u201cthe eternal collaborationist within,\u201d sees herself as \u201ca faded negative in a montage of light-struck doorways,\u201d fears that her thoughts themselves are \u201clike a stage curtain between her and every experience,\u201d and that her Parisian adventure will transform her into \u201cnothing but the mirrored fragments of the dispossessed.\u201d Her imaginings of social life itself, of a mere stroll with sociable strangers, veer toward the ultimate dread:", "Your mind tells you that you could break away, scream, run, but there is some code that passes terror, not just the embarrassment of making a scene or the pride in hiding your fear; it is the queer pact between victim and hunter at the point of surrender, when no choice is left.", "Aside from \u201cA Cage for Lovers,\u201d the last decade of Powell\u2019s writing strikes me as less fulfilled than her earlier ones. Her strongest output, in my view, was the nine-novel stretch that began with \u201cThe Bride\u2019s House\u201d (1929), the first in a remarkable trio of moving Ohio novels (including the often overlooked \u201cThe Story of a Country Boy,\u201d a virtually Dreiserian and psychologically piercing vision of a businessman\u2019s rise and fall), and ended with \u201cThe Locusts Have No King\u201d (1948), a work of sardonic fury regarding the life of the mind that rises to a rarefied romanticism. The novels that she published during this period represent one of the most extraordinary outpourings of sustained literary artistry that the United States can boast. Powell\u2019s New York-based novels turned a scalpel eye on book publishing, radio, and the press. \u201cThe Happy Island\u201d (1938) is a fascinating picture of the corrupting ins and outs of night-club celebrity and literary ambition, and its tale of long-frustrated romance rises to a scathing interior monologue that\u2019s among the most discerningly bitter depictions of a woman\u2019s subjection in love. (\u201cA fish out of water is a dead fish, not a neurotic or discontented or irritable fish, but a dead fish,\u201d Powell writes.) \u201cA Time to Be Born\u201d (1942) looks with a furious skepticism at the misuses and abuses of editorial power and the fabrications of fame. But the novel \u201cThe Wicked Pavilion\u201d (1954) and Powell\u2019s last one, \u201cThe Golden Spur\u201d (1962), both set in artistic circles in Greenwich Village, seem to have lost contact with the pavement, to be books about an idea of New York that was already curdled and shrivelling, without suggesting the new one, of new ideas and a new spirit, that was arising amid it.", "Yet it was only after the publication of \u201cThe Golden Spur\u201d that Powell finally gained a bit of attention (too late for her health and for her work), when Wilson reviewed the book enthusiastically in The New Yorker, in 1962. Powell learned from her publisher that the book received increased attention after the review appeared; it was also nominated for a National Book Award. Yet Wilson\u2014who, in 1944, had written a crabbily negative review of Powell\u2019s autobiographical novel \u201cMy Home Is Far Away\u201d for the magazine\u2014ultimately offered a meagre view of her work, including only a tacked-on overview of her career. He treated \u201cThe Golden Spur\u201d mainly as a representation of the culture of Greenwich Village, and wrote, both hedgingly and condescendingly, \u201cI hope that the tone of this article\u2014sociological and somewhat nostalgic\u2014will not obscure the fact that Dawn Powell\u2019s novels are among the most amusing being written.\u201d The piece belatedly pinned Powell\u2019s name to the cultural bulletin but did little more. It also launched the appreciation of Powell\u2019s work in the wrong direction\u2014a misfire that, over time, helped Powell become the brightly esteemed yet enduringly underestimated star she remains today."], "authors": ["Richard Brody", "Richard Brod"], "keywords": ["book", "cage", "work", "powell", "misunderstood", "outofprint", "novel", "novels", "york", "art", "social", "dawn", "powells", "lovers", "reveals"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
