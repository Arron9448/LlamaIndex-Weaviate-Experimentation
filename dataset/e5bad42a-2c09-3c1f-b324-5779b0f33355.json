But none so brutally jarring as last Wednesday when that same Capitol was desecrated by a pro-Trump mob who fought police, ransacked offices, brandished the Confederate flag and occupied the vice-president\u2019s chair on the Senate dais.", "Insurrection: the day white supremacist terror came to the US Capitol Read more", "Five people lost their lives in the violence. As the mob gathered, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned that overturning Trump\u2019s election defeat would send democracy into \u201ca death spiral\u201d. Hours later the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, evoked the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor by describing it as a \u201cday of infamy\u201d.", "On one level it was the inevitable realisation of Trump\u2019s war on Washington. Casting himself as the barbarian at the gate, his years stoking the furies of racial resentment, anti-establishment contempt and warped conspiracy theories reached their natural conclusion in the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d he once promised to end.", "The events triggered an existential crisis. Some suggested that democracy has not been so precarious since the civil war and that the myth of American exceptionalism has seldom felt so hollow. There was a sense of a global superpower on the wane as inexorably as the first Capitol in Rome.", "Our attitude about America was one in which we would go abroad and brag about how how much better we are Michael Steele", "Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican national committee, told the Guardian: \u201cWe stopped paying attention to what was happening around us. We started taking for granted each other and we weren\u2019t listening to the things that were driving people\u2019s pain and anguish and frustrations. Our political leadership became absorbed in their own self-interest, in their own re-elections.", "\u201cOur attitude about America was one in which we would go abroad and brag about how good we are and how much better we are but then we ignored the fact that may not necessarily be true all the time when things like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor [unarmed African Americans killed by police] happen. That, for me, is a big part of this.\u201d", "America\u2019s failure to carry off a peaceful transition of power did not go unnoticed. A Kenyan newspaper asked, \u201cWho\u2019s the banana republic now?\u201d,and the leader of Iran crowed that it \u201cshows above all how fragile and vulnerable western democracy is\u201d.", "How, 245 years after independence, did it come to this in the world\u2019s most powerful country and biggest economy? The erosion of American democracy has multiple causes \u2013 inequality, racism, distrust of institutions, polarisation, media, social media \u2013 that predate Trump and will survive him.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Azhenedt Sanabria holds flowers as she pays her respects to the late Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died on Thursday from injuries he sustained while defending the US Capitol from a pro-Trump mob. Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters", "Steele added: \u201cThere\u2019s no one thing you can single out with any absolute truth as definitive. It is like making a gumbo and finding the worst ingredients possible and just scratching your head and trying to figure out, why doesn\u2019t this taste right? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for the last 30 years.", "\u201cThis goes back much further than Donald Trump to the breakdown of comity in the House of Representatives and the breakdown of the idea of building a consensus to deal with the nation\u2019s problems. We took tribalism to heart. We used it as a cudgel against our opponents who became our enemies as a badge of honour to rationalise and justify our bad behaviours.\u201d", "The gumbo of democracy has always been bittersweet. Women gained the right to vote only a hundred years ago and, despite hard-won gains, people of colour still face discriminatory voter suppression. When Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president, it will be the 45th presidency held by a white male.", "Within the past half-century, the Watergate scandal tarnished politics as Richard Nixon became the first president to resign. Among his successors, Ronald Reagan actively sowed distrust in government for political ends and slashed taxes for the rich in ways that explain today\u2019s brutal inequality.", "In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich\u2019s pugnacious grandstanding as House speaker, President Bill Clinton\u2019s tawdry impeachment and President George W Bush\u2019s illegal Iraq war further undermined faith in the political class. The end of the cold war removed the unifying force of a common adversary. Automation, globalisation and the 2008 financial crisis devastated many communities and fuelled a sense of injustice and anger at elites.", "Then there was Citizens United, a 2010 ruling by the supreme court that removed many limitations on outside groups spending money to shape elections. Critics say it tilted political influence towards wealthy donors, corporations and special interests. A report from the independent New York University-based Brennan Center found that a very small group of Americans now wield \u201cmore power than at any time since Watergate, while many of the rest seem to be disengaging from politics\u201d. The 2020 elections cost nearly $14bn.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Tea Party supporter holds an anti-Obama sign at a rally in Clinton Township, Michigan, in April 2010. Photograph: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images", "The past decade was also turbo-charged by the election of Barack Obama, America\u2019s first Black president. The racist backlash was evident in the conservative Tea Party movement and Trump\u2019s entry into politics as a \u201cbirther\u201d questioning whether Obama had in fact been born in Kenya and was therefore ineligible.", "In 2015 Trump served up a nationalist, nativist message that promised to build a border wall to keep Mexicans out and make America great again. Wednesday\u2019s insurrection at the Capitol by a mostly white crowd \u2013 meeting little of the heavy-handed security that greeted Black Lives Matter protesters \u2013 could be seen as a final howl of white rage.", "Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt America\u2019s going through a historic generational change. The percentage of whites in the electorate is declining, and dramatically, from 89% in 1980 to about 68% in 2020, and Donald Trump has tapped into the frustration of the sliding status of a group of less well-educated whites. Frankly, I think we saw them streaming into Congress.", "Donald Trump spoke to their grievances but the future of America is multiracial, multiethnic Larry Jacobs", "\u201cThat\u2019s not America\u2019s future. That\u2019s the part of America that feels very much that it\u2019s on the decline, Donald Trump spoke to their grievances but the future of America is multiracial, multiethnic.\u201d", "America has weathered political storms before but its cracks are in urgent need of structural repair. Republican presidential candidates have won the national popular vote only once in the last 32 years yet sometimes claimed the White House via the electoral college. The Senate, where big and small states have an equal voice, has become unrepresentative of the population.", "Thanks to gerrymandering, blue states have turned bluer and red states have turned redder. The loudest and most extreme voices are often rewarded in party primaries; hence QAnon conspiracy theorists who embrace Trump have prospered in Republican circles.", "Jacobs said: \u201cStarting in the early 1970s, the political parties changed how they nominate candidates and in a fit of democratic euphoria they decided to create primaries. The primaries were to give power to the people but what it did instead was to give power to extremists.\u201d", "Polarisation is now stark across class, race, geography and educational attainment. Biden\u2019s 2020 election-winning base in 509 counties encompasses 71% of America\u2019s economic activity, while Trump\u2019s losing base of 2,547 counties represents just 29% of the economy, according to the Brookings Institution thinktank.", "Rightwing TV networks such as Fox News, Newsmax and the One America News Network, and social media such as Facebook and Twitter, have fuelled the tribalism and helped generate alternative reality bubbles, filling a vacuum left by the decline of local newspapers.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest An armed extremist stands in the Michigan Capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, in April 2020 as part of a protest against Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Subsequently several people were charged with a plot to kidnap Whitmer.

The convulsions at the Capitol were indicative of a febrile environment that last year saw a plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and it did not deter 147 Republican senators and House members going ahead with votes to overturn the election result.", "Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, told the Axios website: \u201cYou can\u2019t lump US democracy in with Canada, Germany and Japan any more. We\u2019re now midway between them and Hungary.\u201d", "Yet there are still reasons to believe the glass is half full. Civil society and the media are robust. The courts remain strong and independent, as they showed in rejecting false claims of election fraud.", "Although gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts are far from over, Democrats just won two runoffs in Georgia to take control of the Senate and complete the repudiation of Trump.", "I see election officials, including Republicans, calling it straight. I mean, where is the breakdown in democracy? Larry Jacobs", "Jacobs said: \u201cWe had the largest turnout in an American election. Joe Biden beat Donald Trump. These Georgia Senate elections are very important; this was the heart of the Republican party\u2019s strength and it was one of the most racist states in America only half a century ago. From Dr [Martin Luther] King\u2019s pulpit, we get a Black senator, the first from Georgia, and somehow that needs to be filtered into the story about American democracy.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not one-sided. The Trump phenomenon may well be an isolated development, one that will have legs, for sure, but not one that\u2019s dominant. I look at this election and what I see is judges appointed by both parties, including Trump, standing up for the rule of law. I see election officials, including Republicans, calling it straight. I mean, where is the breakdown in democracy there? I don\u2019t see it. I think people are jumping to overly broad conclusions based on the horror of January 6.\u201d", "Trump's Maga insurrectionists were perverse US civil war re-enactors | Sidney Blumenthal Read more", "Steele, the former Republican chairman who is now a senior adviser to the anti-Trump group the Lincoln Project, agreed that the idea America should be relegated from the premier league of global democracies is \u201cbullshit\u201d.

But it is a lesson not only to us here but to the world: watch your back.", "\u201cDon\u2019t think you don\u2019t have rightwing nationalism and populism lurking beneath your surfaces.
