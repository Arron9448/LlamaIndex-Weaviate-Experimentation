But the actions of certain ambitious Republican officeholders in the days leading up to the tragedy were not clouded by confusion.", "Trump may have lost the election, but his movement was on the march, and for politicians hoping someday to succeed Trump as president, that meant an opportunity was afoot.", "With Trump now finally accepting he will leave office, the future leadership of his movement is increasingly up for grabs, with a ragtag band of senators, congressman, Trump family members \u2013 and Trump himself \u2013 already jostling for the position.", "Whether anyone apart from the president is able to successfully ride the tiger of racism, nihilism and grievance politics that carried Trump to near-re-election after four years of American chaos and hundreds of thousands of preventable pandemic deaths is an open question.", "It also might be an irrelevant question, if Trump decides to stage a 2023-24 stadium tour doubling as a new presidential campaign.", "\u201cAbsent disqualification, the 2024 GOP presidential nomination remains his if he wants it,\u201d tweeted Dave Wasserman, Congress editor of the Cook Political Report.", "But with Trump gone, for the moment, after years of rock-like reign over the Republican party, powerful currents of political ambition and realignment have swirled into the vacuum.", "A protester holds a Trump flag inside the US Capitol on 6 January. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images", "Longtime Trump loyalists, chief among them the vice-president, Mike Pence, have suddenly broken with the president over his fight to reverse the election result. Mick Mulvaney, the former chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland whose loyalty helped Trump escape conviction in the impeachment scandal, resigned over the Capitol riot debacle, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t stay.\u201d", "Two firebrand conservative senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, went the other direction, taking up Trump\u2019s cause \u2013 only to see their campaign result almost immediately in the death of a police officer and four others, and the vandalization of the US Capitol.", "A third young senator with designs on the presidency, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, blasted his plotting colleagues \u201cwho, for political advantage, were giving false hope to their supporters\u201d, he said. The Republican old guard, meanwhile, in the guise of Mitt Romney, who has actually run for president \u2013 twice \u2013 accused his colleagues of being \u201ccomplicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy\u201d.", "Even the former Republican House speaker John Boehner, who since his 2015 retirement has mostly limited his commentary on politics to tweeted pictures of himself mowing his lawn, said the Grand Old party (GOP) was in trouble.", "\u201cI once said the party of Lincoln and Reagan is off taking a nap,\u201d Boehner wrote on Thursday. \u201cThe nap has become a nightmare for our nation. The GOP must awaken.\u201d", "For certain Republicans, the violent and deadly near-sacking of the Capitol on Wednesday by white supremacists and other Trump sympathizers seemed to be only the second most disturbing event of the week.", "The night before, Republicans had lost two runoff US senate elections in Georgia, a state that until 2020 had not voted for a Democrat for president for 30 years.
