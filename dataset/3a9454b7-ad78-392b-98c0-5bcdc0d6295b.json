Cameron Diaz has Avaline, Mary J. Blige has Sun Goddess, and Sarah Jessica Parker her award-winning partnership with Invivo. It comes as no surprise that the latter\u2019s 2019 Sauvignon Blanc is considered one of the top 100 wines this year, according to Wine Spectator. \u201cI\u2019ve loved learning about the business and everything I can about wine,\u201d says Parker.", "In-person wine tasting and blending would\u2019ve created the perfect follow-up to the award-winning 2019 vintage, but amid the pandemic Parker and the wine producers in New Zealand had to adapt, quickly. The solution: an at-home wine blending kit and virtual tasting sessions. \u201cWe\u2019ve now done two virtual blending sessions. We did our second Sauvignon Blanc in April and we just did our second Rose from Provence. it\u2019s really fun. It\u2019s pure science, trying to reach the perfect blend based on the accuracy of each pour,\u201d Parker explains. Of course, with the actor in New York and her partners in New Zealand, the time difference presented an added challenge. \u201cWe normally start in the middle of the day, which feels very peculiar to be drinking that much in the middle of day\u2014or in some cases, it\u2019s been really welcome.\u201d", "As Parker prepares for her holiday at home with a honey-baked ham and a roast (\u201call those things we typically make, just fewer and less\u201d), her wines will be helping others get a meal to eat. Through a partnership with FEED Projects, Invivo x SJP has committed to donating a varying percentage per each individual purchase in order to reach their goal of 330,000 meals for those who are food insecure.", "When it comes to her downsized family dinner\u2014she has 8 brothers and sisters, but they\u2019re spread out across places and time zones, meaning it will be a holiday of Facetimes\u2014Parker is finally bringing out a set of dishes she\u2019s been collecting over the years, figuring it\u2019s high time she fully appreciated their beauty and utility. \u201cThey\u2019re all mismatched hotel plates,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor years I was like, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t use these,\u2019 but now I\u2019m like: Use them. Put them in the dishwasher. Enjoy them.\u201d She\u2019ll be pairing the dishes with jelly jars and bistro cups for a nonchalant gathering, which is an approach she hopes her wine inspires, rather than the intimidation that some bottles evoke. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any rules. The whole point is to just enjoy it.\u201d It\u2019s advice we could all use, heading into a season of festivities that won\u2019t look like any other."], "authors": ["Dayna Carney", "Dayna Carne"], "keywords": ["wining", "virtual", "parker", "holiday", "blending", "sessions", "zealand", "tasting", "theyre", "season", "wines", "wine", "second", "jessica", "sarah", "dining"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
