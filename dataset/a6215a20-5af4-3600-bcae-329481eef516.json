Many of the businesses are multi-generational, and\u2014let me put it this way\u2014a lot of Chinatown is pre-digital,\u201d Young adds. \u201cThat\u2019s part of its charm and beauty. But they don\u2019t take credit cards. There\u2019s no way that you can order online.\u201d (Young even recalls a recent visit to a restaurant that opened in 1967 and was still operating with its original cash register.)", "For Young, it was about harnessing the power of social media to bridge the gaps that these traditionally-minded businesses were unable to do themselves in the age of lockdowns and social distancing. \u201cThey are not doing Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,\u201d Young continues. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have time. These are hard-working immigrant businesses, they\u2019re there seven days a week, working 10 to 14 hours a day, and that would feel frivolous for them, I think, to be tweeting or doing an Instagram post.\u201d", "Young also wants to spotlight how integral these immigrant communities are to the history and social fabric of the American urban landscape, especially given that Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown is not considered a historic district and is therefore highly susceptible to gentrification. As many of the most historic restaurants and produce stores have closed\u2014some that have been running for over 60 years\u2014those properties could be quickly snapped up by developers unconcerned with the district\u2019s cultural significance. Working in collaboration with filmmaker Dan Ahn and the Poster House museum, Young began creating an oral history project of recorded interviews with a number of restaurateurs and small business owners in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown just hours before New York\u2019s first government-mandated lockdown in March 2020. Titled Coronavirus: Chinatown Stories, the powerful series was featured by The Smithsonian National Museum of American History both at their annual youth summit and their Food History Gala last fall.", "\u201cI mean, America is a land of immigrants, and San Francisco and Manhattan\u2019s Chinatowns are historic immigrant communities that are struggling to survive right now,\u201d says Young. \u201cThis is the story of America. This is how Asian immigrants, Chinese immigrants have been able to get a foothold in this country and start their lives. They are communities where food justice is key, where people of all different ethnicities are able to access high-quality, nutritious food at affordable prices. You walk like three blocks outside of Chinatown, and a supermarket has the same produce for double the price. It\u2019s very unique, and it tells the story of what it means to be American.\u201d", "It\u2019s a story that feels particularly urgent given the dramatic rise in anti-Asian hate crimes across the U.S. over the past year, the most recent and most visible occurrence being the shooting in Atlanta on March 16 that resulted in eight deaths, the majority of whom were Asian-American women. For Asian-American service industry workers, not only is there an increased risk of catching COVID via regular in-person interactions, but also the fear of harassment, intimidation, or even violence. \u201cWith the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, it makes it more challenging for workers to even be coming to work,\u201d Young adds. \u201cThere\u2019s fear.\u201d As Young\u2019s project makes clear, at a time when many are looking for ways to support and show solidarity with AAPI communities around the country, heading to your local Chinatown is a good place to start.", "\u201cI hope that everyone shows solidarity in speaking out against Asian hate, but on top of that, the best way to combat hate is with love,\u201d Young concludes. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to shower all these businesses with as much love as possible. We have to show up for them now.\u201d"], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["businesses", "communities", "history", "social", "young", "immigrant", "mission", "save", "americas", "hate", "historic", "grace", "manhattans", "chinatowns", "chinatown", "immigrants"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
