It wrapped things up in 2019 with Avengers: Endgame, which became the highest-grossing movie of all time. Meanwhile, its publishing arm has spent the past 10 years releasing a raft of new, exciting comic book titles. No surprise, then, that the self-proclaimed House of Ideas is planning to expand its reach going into 2020. What might surprise you, though, is how Marvel is planning to do it.", "Late last week, the company launched a new co-production with the serialized audiobook/ebook publisher Serial Box. Titled Thor: Metal Gods, it's a fresh story about the God of Thunder, and a move into a whole new medium for Marvel's superheroes. \"We\u2019re focused on more of an audiobook experience, where it\u2019s typically a single person telling you a story rather than actors reading from a script,\u201d explains Molly Barton, Serial Box's cofounder and CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the oldest forms of audio entertainment: one person telling a group of people a story.\u201d", "Metal Gods is far more than a simple storytelling experience, however; across 15 weekly episodes, written by a group of writers led by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, the series tells an ambitious tale of Thor and Loki attempting to prevent a cosmic apocalypse with the help of a Korean demi-goddess and a gender-ambiguous space pirate. (Actor Daniel Gillies is the narrator of the series.) It\u2019s the first of four such audio serials being created as part of the partnership between the two companies.", "This isn\u2019t the first foray into audio for Marvel\u2014the company partnered with podcast platform Stitcher to create a Wolverine podcast in 2018, and has licensed radio adaptations of its characters going all the way back to 1967\u2019s Doctor Strange series on New York\u2019s WBAI\u2014but it is a sign that audio is playing an increasingly important role in the company\u2019s plans for 2020 and beyond; just two months ago, Marvel and SiriusXM announced a multiyear partnership that will include a number of scripted and nonfiction projects.", "According to Barton, Marvel is well aware of the potential that serialized audio presents for growing its audience even further. \u201cIn one of our earliest conversations with Marvel, they said, \u2018We understand that serial storytelling is really fundamental to our way of [delivering] entertainment content,\u2019 and they\u2019re really excited about audio,\u201d she says.", "Whether or not fans will be excited about it, though, remains to be seen. Marvel has proven quite skilled at getting people who don't read comics to see movies based on them, but getting folks to listen to superhero audio stories might prove a more difficult task. But Stewart-Ahn says that, narratively, the medium allows fans to do something they don't have a chance to do at the multiplex: imagine the scene for themselves.", "\u201cThere are visual things I believe you can do in comics that you can\u2019t even replicate in movies, and vice versa,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do believe all mediums lend themselves to something unique. No matter how hyper-detailed an illustration is, or a prose description, you still need the person on the other end, the audience, to complete the illusion.\u201d", "To create that illusion, however, Marvel and Serial Box rely on a collaboration not that different from filmmaking. In the beginning, Marvel offers input on an initial treatment and subsequent pilot, with editors from the company offering guidance on the story and characters before a writers' room chosen by Serial Box moves forward with the series itself. As part of the arrangement, Serial Box got to choose what Marvel properties it wanted to use, which Barton says meant they got to pick the characters with strong fandoms, but also ones \"where there was room to explore and also to expand the story world.\" (Beyond Thor, the companies will roll out series for Black Widow, Black Panther, and Jessica Jones throughout 2020.)"], "title": "Marvel Conquered Movies.
