Their ballistics are their ballet, the play of pouring, and a Rorschach-like invitation to the discovery of form. Paramecia and lilies alike bloom under her open-ended colors and shapes. Pollock is praised for pouring and dripping, as though inviting randomness, but one senses the significant amount of figural underpainting that exists beneath the surface. Even in the case of a painter as original and as decorative as Joan Mitchell, there\u2019s a kind of stenographic calligraphic reduction of Monet, Impressionism remade as Action. By contrast, Frankenthaler\u2019s images seep into the material; there really is no paint surface as we think of it, no top to be on top of.", "Her work of the fifties and sixties speaks to a world not of action but of reaction, of absorption and fluidity, with intimations of aquariums and hothouse flowers rather than of the usual Eighth Street stoplights and street corners. As much as Mitchell is in active dialogue with Monet\u2014a devotion so intense that it led her to move to V\u00e9theuil, up the hill from his old house\u2014Frankenthaler seems in conversation with Bonnard. They have the same love of faded color, and the same feeling for designs that are almost chatty, this bit laid alongside that bit, rather than \u201call over,\u201d in the manner that links Monet and Pollock. There are Bonnard watercolors that, if one simply enlarges a sky or a flower surface, look eerily like Frankenthaler paintings. Even Picasso\u2019s dismissal of Bonnard\u2019s compositions as \u201ca potpourri of indecision\u201d holds for her pictures. In this sense, Frankenthaler\u2019s work asks what would happen if you took this kind of Bonnard watercolor\u2014with its deliberately slack, soft-edged intimacy\u2014eliminated the more obvious referents, and worked big. But that principle of displacement is a truth of all modernist art, where shifts in practice come from seeing in the margins of an activity\u2014like the spattered paint on a drop cloth\u2014the possibilities of something central.", "In a curious way, Frankenthaler\u2019s revenge on Newman has been achieved, almost accidentally, in the past decades, with Newman\u2019s pictures inspected for signs of patriarchal phallocentrism. His sublime zips have even been blandly likened to actual zippers\u2014\u201cmundane openings onto male organs,\u201d as one academic put it\u2014an analogy that would have been seen as blasphemously belittling in his day. Meanwhile, Frankenthaler\u2019s weepiness, condescended to as feminine, looks more richly fertile.", "Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell, a New York power couple of abstract painting, in 1963. Photograph by Arnold Newman / Getty", "For a nonparticipant, these arguments will seem crudely reductive. If a straight line is to stand for phallocentrism while a soft center stands for its vaginal opposite, do we have an argument worth winning? Both Tom Wolfe and Robert Hughes were indignant at this seeming smallness of meaning and metaphor in abstract painting. And yet the reduction of the argument to simple gestures is the whole point of the game. What makes good games matter is the commitment of their players to the rules as the springboard of invention. Art is its constraints. Scrabble players don\u2019t suppose that spelling words is significant; what\u2019s significant is assembling words from a limited array of letters. Chess players don\u2019t think about capturing kings and rooks; they think about strategies for capturing kings and rooks. No painter imagined that eliminating perspective or storytelling from pictures was inherently virtuous, or that the picture plane was a prime place in itself; they were drawn to the game of eliminating everything else, then finding out what was left and how it could communicate. The dignity of American abstract art lies in the intersection of the obviousness of its motifs and the complexity of its motives. It says smart things simply.", "A great and somewhat limiting event of Frankenthaler\u2019s life took place six years after \u201cMountains and Sea,\u201d when she married Robert Motherwell, an older Abstract Expressionist of unimpeachable integrity. At the time, Motherwell had an Arthur Miller-like aura of dignity and authority. His signature work\u2014big funereal blobs of black solemnly processing across a void, called \u201cElegies to the Spanish Republic\u201d\u2014provided, in retrospect, a too easily remembered recipe for seriousness in the serious fifties. The work \u201cindicates,\u201d as Method actors of that period learned to say of a too neatly telegraphed emotion, rather than inhabits its mood. The obvious visual metaphor\u2014big black forms meaning big black feelings\u2014was bolstered by an obvious progressive piety in the title. Motherwell\u2019s best works were his less strenuously virtuous collages, built around his favorite brand of French cigarettes rather than around his loftiest beliefs. But the romance between the two artists is genuinely moving: Motherwell and Frankenthaler fell on each other as soul mates. Frankenthaler took in his two daughters by his first marriage, and they made their home in an Upper East Side town house. For a while, Frankenthaler and Motherwell were the Lunts of abstract painting, the unquestioned power couple of the form.", "Although the marital connection, as rivals groused, assisted Frankenthaler\u2019s career in certain ways, it may have arrested it in others. For a very long time, Frankenthaler\u2019s style supplied a default look for American abstract art. In Paul Mazursky\u2019s late-seventies feminist film \u201cAn Unmarried Woman,\u201d the SoHo artist played by Alan Bates paints in just this style (which, historically, is a little too late); perhaps it was inevitable that the style was appropriated from a woman and assigned to a male painter by a male filmmaker. For all Frankenthaler\u2019s fame, though, she was typed as a member of an earlier generation than the one she belonged to. When subsequent waves of art\u2014Pop art and Minimalism\u2014came washing over, she seemed like an Old Guard holdout rather than, as the lightsome, colorful, improvisational nature of her painting might have suggested, a predecessor of an art less self-consciously angst-ridden than Abstract Expressionism.", "The marriage brought other forms of misfortune. Motherwell, whose father had been the president of Wells Fargo, turned out to have been the prisoner of a traumatic childhood, and sank into alcoholism. Frankenthaler and Motherwell divorced in 1971, and perhaps it should have been easier for peers and critics to re-situate her art within the generation that rebelled against the Ab Ex anguish. A painting like her simple silhouette of orange, \u201cStride\u201d (1969), now in the Met, looks gaily Day-Glo, very much of its time. There was an evident overlap, as the art historian Robert Rosenblum once pointed out, between the high-keyed color and ease of post-painterly abstraction and the formal qualities of Pop; they were both helium-filled antidotes to the dark agonies of Abstract Expressionism proper.", "Frankenthaler, had she been the careerist some decried, might have benefitted from this resemblance. She didn\u2019t, in part because of her allegiance to the \u201cserious\u201d stuff. Some of her best painting, certainly, is her most larksome. Pictures like \u201cTutti-Fruitti\u201d (1966), now in Buffalo, or \u201cRoyal Fireworks\u201d (1975)\u2014which sold at Sotheby\u2019s last June for a handsome, though not Pollockian, sum\u2014have a warmth and a brightness of affect that seem entirely their own. The appealing pousse-caf\u00e9 of color in \u201cTutti-Fruitti\u201d implies sherbets, water ices, fireworks\u2014nothing \u201cdeep\u201d and everything alive. They have what Nemerov calls \u201cchildlike connotations,\u201d an unapologetic, inspiring embrace of color for its own, elemental sake.", "Frankenthaler continued to paint late into her life. She remarried, in 1994, to an investment banker, and five years later they moved to a house in Darien, Connecticut, right on the Long Island Sound. There her paintings picked up the sea greens and turquoises that, for the last dozen years of her life, she could see from her studio.", "Learning to be an aesthete in middle age, as Nemerov has, is like taking tango lessons in your fifties: the spirit is admirable, but the moves are awkward. Almost overequipped to handle the intersection of art and social history\u2014Nemerov does a masterly job on the relation of Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poetry and Frankenthaler\u2019s painting\u2014he is underequipped to make people and pictures live on the page. No one could pick a picture out from all the others after reading his description of it. At one point, we\u2019re told, of Frankenthaler\u2019s 1955 \u201cBlue Territory,\u201d \u201cThe graffiti of a schoolgirl\u2019s private confession takes on the aura of saintly ecstasies, a conventional sign of forlorn adolescence martialed almost against its will into a bold strapping air of titanic achievement\u201d\u2014a description that reveals little about the picture except that the author likes it. Attempting to create novelistic character and an inhabited world, Nemerov relies on mechanical double adjectives and stock word pairings: \u201cElegant yet earthy, Martha Frankenthaler was a person of vibrant enthusiasms and impetuous moods\u201d; Greenberg is \u201ctough as nails.\u201d", "Another struggle is presented by Nemerov\u2019s puritanical take on Frankenthaler\u2019s concern for her career, too much remarked on in her day; she thought nothing of posing for a spread in a popular magazine if doing so would increase her fame and sell her pictures. Nemerov assures us that, nevertheless, \u201csomething saved Helen. Her paintings stood apart from her quest for recognition and sales.\u201d Why, though, would she need to be saved from being sold? Being part of the world of buying and selling is constitutive of what the visual arts have meant and have been since the end of the medieval era. Only priests and academics find anything shameful in it. Whatever is lost in contamination by commerce is more than made up for by what\u2019s gained in independence. Frankenthaler painted what she wanted, and people bought what they wanted.", "Nemerov worries, too, about the possibility that bourgeois collectors found her subtle intimacies merely soothing. Yet the idea that New York collectors would seek out pictures they thought comforting is a misreading of the psychology of New York collectors; they like to collect what they don\u2019t think likes them. The prestige lies in showing that you don\u2019t need to be flattered by the art you own. This is why, in the apartments of Manhattan collectors, sweet photographs of the grandchildren are hived off in the bedroom, while kinky Koonses and Bacons take places of honor next to the coffee table. (The people who thought of Frankenthaler\u2019s art as in any way \u201ceasy\u201d were, in that period, teaching in colleges, not collecting paintings.)", "Nemerov\u2019s admiration for his heroine sometimes makes him overrate her originality. \u201cHelen\u2019s sensitivity allowed her to grant ordinary experience\u2014faltering, incomplete, apparently meaningless\u2014the large solemnity of art,\u201d he writes, as if this were not the achievement of every landscape and still-life since the birth of painting. Of all the constraints that make art matter, that pairing\u2014small, sensual objects seeking big, lifesaving points\u2014is the most familiar. Having once been shuttered in a classroom where commonplace lyricism is censored and the depiction of intimate experience is assumed to be merely a cover for bourgeois ideology, Nemerov is a bit like Moli\u00e8re\u2019s M. Jourdain, discovering that he has been speaking prose his whole life\u2014or, in this case, discovering that, while he has been speaking prose, everyone he studies has been reciting poetry all along.", "From today\u2019s perspective, the most striking thing about Frankenthaler\u2019s career is how much all the things that were said to belittle her, sometimes by other women, now seem to point toward her art\u2019s larger soul. Joan Mitchell may have sneered at Frankenthaler as that \u201cKotex painter,\u201d while Grace Hartigan said that her pictures seemed \u201cmade between cocktails and dinner.\u201d Now the Bonnard-like ease within the cycles of domesticity, and even the possible origins of her work in menstrual staining, are seen by feminist critics as an admirable uplifting of the \u201cabject.\u201d Nemerov is appropriately voluble on this subject: \u201cThe painting that left the studio, the painting that hung on the gallery wall, offered such a range of experiences and emotions that it might disguise how it had all started with a gesture connoting such a private and bodily function.\u201d", "He is surely right to sense a larger American story here, about women, painting, and the elevation of the decorative instinct in art. Impressionist painting became uniquely valued in America at a time when it was still scorned in France, in large part for being \u201cfeminine,\u201d instinctive, and soft. (It was no accident that the leading post-Impressionist correctives to Impressionism were almost comically phallic, as with Seurat\u2019s Piero-like pillar people.) The Chicago curator Gloria Groom has established that American women played a crucial role here. Mary Cassatt and May Alcott (the original Amy March) formed a circle in France that assisted married women with money to buy pictures, and advised them to heed the judgment of Sara Hallowell, a remarkable curator and art adviser in Paris. These viewers prized exactly the qualities that made the art of Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro dubious in France: non-heroic, housebound subjects like babies and kitchens, an allergy to firm contour and an adherence to the domesticity of the passing day. This tradition of \u201cfeminine\u201d defiance is part of the inheritance of Frankenthaler\u2019s art. It extends to a painter like Elizabeth Murray, but also to the seemingly Dadaist activity of Janine Antoni, who was rightly included in \u201cPretty Raw: After and Around Helen Frankenthaler,\u201d a 2015 show at Brandeis University. Antoni chews chocolate and then, spitting it out, forms it into her own signature objects\u2014an extension, in deadpan form, of Frankenthaler\u2019s revaluing of the messy necessary liquids of life.", "In the classic pattern of the oppressed taking on the values of the oppressor, social radicals still sometimes think that only \u201csubversive\u201d art\u2014tense and tedious\u2014can be serious, while things that look like big watercolors cannot be. This dismissal leaps past gender to the heart of the modernist enterprise, where Monet\u2019s delight in painting for the eye is still suspect, and Matisse\u2019s calm insistence that he saw his art as akin to a comfortable armchair for an exhausted businessman is still the most taboo of all artist manifestos. And yet this unashamedly decorative impulse, experienced as a woman\u2019s domain, is a constant in the American tradition. For her fond biographer, Frankenthaler\u2019s art delights the eye, as it was designed to, and that\u2019s enough. Enough? It\u2019s everything. \u2666"], "authors": ["Adam Gopnik", "Adam Gopni"], "keywords": ["frankenthaler", "pictures", "nemerov", "art", "painting", "messy", "life", "abstract", "helen", "motherwell", "think", "frankenthalers", "painter"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
