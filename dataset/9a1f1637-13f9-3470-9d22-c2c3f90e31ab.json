The average lifespan of collective-defence alliances over the past five centuries is just 15 years. NATO has not only survived to three score and ten, but is in many ways in fine fettle. It remains \u201cthe strongest alliance in history\u201d, says Jens Stoltenberg, its secretary-general, and has implemented \u201cthe largest reinforcement of our collective defence in a generation, with for the first time in our history combat-ready troops in the eastern part of the alliance\u201d. Yet it has manoeuvred around its anniversary year with all the caution of an army entering hostile territory\u2014the final, fraught operation being a gathering of its leaders on December 3rd at Buckingham Palace, where the queen is to host a reception, and a summit the next day in Watford, just outside London.", "Since the collapse of communism NATO has ranged far and wide, fighting terrorism in Afghanistan and pirates off the Horn of Africa. But Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine in 2014 prompted a return to the core mission of defending Europe. The response has been vigorous. NATO has put multinational brigades in the three Baltic states and Poland. It has set itself demanding readiness targets, aiming by next year to have 30 mechanised battalions, 30 air squadrons and 30 warships ready to move within 30 days. It has held its biggest exercises since the end of the cold war: \u201cTrident Juncture\u201d last year involved some 50,000 troops in and around Norway; next year about 20,000 will come over from America for \u201cDefender 2020\u201d.", "So why the current caution? It is a tale of three presidents, says Kori Schake of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.", "No prizes for guessing the first of the trio. President Donald Trump\u2019s bolshiness towards the alliance probably explains why NATO chose to mark its actual 70th birthday, in April, with a meeting of foreign ministers rather than government heads. Better to avoid the risk of another bust-up of the sort seen at the Brussels summit the previous July, when Mr Trump even threatened to pull America out of the organisation if the rest failed to shape up. True, he no longer calls the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d, as he did before taking office, but he has been louder than his predecessors in criticising allies for not spending enough on defence and happy to point the finger\u2014especially at Germany.", "The scope for Mr Trump to make mischief in London this week is not confined to NATO. He may also be tempted to weigh in on the British election, now less than two weeks away. And the two topics are linked: Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party\u2019s leader, is no fan of NATO or of America; were he to become prime minister Britain\u2019s defence posture could change radically. Mr Trump, however, has an election back home to worry about, and with next year\u2019s vote in mind he may become more inclined to boast about NATO rather than to bash it. He has already been claiming credit for significantly increased defence spending by the European allies and Canada\u2014now estimated at an extra $130bn between 2016 and 2020.", "Even if Mr Trump tones down his criticism, the doubts he has raised about America\u2019s commitment to the alliance have not been lost on a second presidential troublemaker: Emmanuel Macron of France. In a recent interview with The Economist Mr Macron said that NATO was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d. He bemoaned the absence of co-ordination between America and its partners. \u201cStrategically and politically,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to recognise that we have a problem.\u201d He also questioned whether Article Five, the cornerstone of the alliance that sees an attack on one country as an attack on all, could be depended on. \u201cIf the Bashar al-Assad regime decides to retaliate against Turkey,\u201d he asked, \u201cwill we commit ourselves under it?\u201d", "Mr Macron\u2019s comments caused consternation. Frontline states worried about his push for a strategic dialogue with Russia. Germany seemed to suspect him of wanting stronger European defence to replace NATO, rather than complementing it. Mr Stoltenberg says that \u201cthis idea that the US is leaving Europe is just simply wrong\u201d, and insists that the European Union \u201ccannot defend Europe\u201d, especially after Brexit, when 80% of NATO\u2019s defence spending will be from non-EU allies. But Mr Macron is unrepentant: \u201cThe questions I have asked are open questions, that we haven\u2019t solved yet,\u201d he said after meeting Mr Stoltenberg in Paris on November 28th. And Turkey, he repeated, could not expect solidarity from its allies if it acts unilaterally in Syria.", "That brought an angry response from the third president in this drama: Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cMr Macron, I appeal to you from Turkey and I will say it at NATO,\u201d he fumed: \u201chave your own brain death checked out first.\u201d Turkey is an important NATO ally, but it has been an awkward one of late. It has upset America by buying a Russian air-defence system, and as a result has been pushed out of the F-35 fighter-jet programme, for fear that vital data would be compromised. Now it is said to be holding up NATO decisions on defence plans, demanding that the allies recognise the YPG Kurdish militia in northern Syria as a terrorist group.", "At the London summit the allies may find a way to finesse Mr Erdogan\u2019s obstructionism. With luck, Mr Trump will not spoil the party. The allies will not only reassert that Article Five is ironclad; they will also look to the future. They have just agreed to make space a fifth domain for operations (alongside land, sea, air and cyber), and have started to think collectively about the strategic implications of China\u2019s rise, a first step towards a more co-ordinated response. They have also agreed on a rebalancing of payments into NATO's central budget, which will see Germany pay a little more and America a little less by 2021. But Mr Macron\u2019s awkward questions\u2014what will Article Five mean tomorrow? what does it mean to belong to NATO?\u2014will not be solved in Watford."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "A tale of three presidents - NATO\u2019s Watford summit features a troublesome trio", "pubDate": null, "summary": "It is a tale of three presidents, says Kori Schake of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.\nThe scope for Mr Trump to make mischief in London this week is not confined to NATO.\nIn a recent interview with The Economist Mr Macron said that NATO was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d.\nBut Mr Macron is unrepentant: \u201cThe questions I have asked are open questions, that we haven\u2019t solved yet,\u201d he said after meeting Mr Stoltenberg in Paris on November 28th.\nWith luck, Mr Trump will not spoil the party.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2019/12/01/natos-watford-summit-features-a-troublesome-trio"}
