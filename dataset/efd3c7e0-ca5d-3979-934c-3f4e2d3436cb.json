Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the House could vote to impeach him.", "Trump would then face a trial early next year in the Republican-controlled Senate. With a two-thirds majority of senators needed to convict Trump and remove him from office, his survival \u2013 until the November 2020 election, at least \u2013 seems likely.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump dashed off an acrid letter to Pelosi, charging her with \u2018declaring open war on American democracy\u2019.

On Tuesday, he dashed off an acrid letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, charging her with \u201cdeclaring open war on American Democracy\u201d and calling impeachment an \u201celection-nullification scheme\u201d.", "But a mountain of evidence indicates that it was Trump who sought to undermine American democracy. Harboring no illusions about the political risks of pursuing impeachment, and waiting perhaps for the case to build to overwhelming strength, Pelosi for months held her fire. Then a whistleblower complaint originating inside the White House in August was temporarily blocked from reaching Congress, as is required by law.", "The complaint, alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election\u201d, snapped Pelosi to action.

A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the House. The chief justice of the US Supreme Court then presides over proceedings in the Senate. The president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.
