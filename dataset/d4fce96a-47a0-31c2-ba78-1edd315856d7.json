Over the course of two decades, this strange cipher of a man has traveled from the Romanian lab where he was engineered on a globe-trotting journey of, well, assassination. Hitman 3 marks the end of IO Interactive\u2019s World of Assassination trilogy, and we were fortunate enough to be able to play through much of the game\u2019s conclusion. Whether you\u2019re a devoted fan of the series or someone who just likes to throw rubber duckies at guards, we\u2019ve got something for you in our extensive 14-page cover story. It\u2019s based on hours of hands on from three of the game\u2019s six levels, as well as in-depth interviews with some of the talented developers who made it all possible.", "We\u2019ve got a slew of information about some of Hitman 3\u2019s new levels, including an explosive opening in Dubai worthy of a summer blockbuster, as well as a methodically paced murder mystery in England, where you get to actually investigate and solve a case. There\u2019s plenty to unpack, so get ready to set aside some time for this massive feature.", "Agent 47\u2019s adventure isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s coming to a close. We\u2019re nearing the end of 2020 (good riddance!), and we take an extensive look back at the year and the games that it brought. In addition to featuring our Top 10 Games of 2020 list, we break down the big events that happened over the course of the past 12 months. There was a lot to process, from console launches to the obvious global effects of COVID-19, and associate editor Blake Hester runs down the highlights in a four-page feature. That\u2019s capped off with a massive recap of the best and brightest games of the year, broken down by best-in-genre categories and highlighted selections that call out the games that personally resonated with Game Informer editors. And finally, we have our traditional editor top 10 lists, so you can see how our picks align \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 with your own personal favorites.", "That\u2019s in addition to other features, such as Liana Ruppert\u2019s look at the tech behind Bloober Team\u2019s The Medium; Matt Miller\u2019s roundup of the year\u2019s best tabletop games; and Blake Hester\u2019s interview with Paul W.S. Anderson about the Monster Hunter movie. And, of course, the Hitman 3 issue is filled with game previews, reviews, and other exclusive info that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.", "Print subscribers can expect their issues to begin arriving in the coming days/weeks.
