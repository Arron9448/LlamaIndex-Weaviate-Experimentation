What if he had then avoided all his other would-be assassins and lived to old age well into the 21st century? (He would have been 89 this year.)", "Though it is often a mistake to attribute too much power to shape history to a single person, King\u2019s death was the spur for improvements in civil rights and race relations that might not otherwise have occurred. Had he made it through 1968 alive, however, he would have ended the 1960s as a controversial, divisive figure for many white Americans. A Gallup poll in 1966 found that only 32% of Americans had a positive view of King. In a Gallup survey in 1967 to identify the ten most-admired Americans, George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, made the list. King did not.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "By the year of his murder, King was associated with three unpopular causes, all of which he would probably have pursued had he lived. The first was opposition to the Vietnam war. This was a fringe view in America when King embraced it: in 1967 only about 30% of Americans agreed with his stance that America should not send troops to Saigon. King\u2019s conviction that the Vietnam war was a mistake was so strong that he was planning to do all he could to prevent Lyndon Johnson from running for president again in 1968, despite everything Johnson had done to pass the Civil Rights Act.", "In 1968 King was exploring the idea of supporting a moderate Republican over Johnson in the presidential election. George Romney, father of Mitt, seemed to be his preferred choice. Had Romney won the Republican nomination instead of Richard Nixon, the Romneys might have become the leading Republican political dynasty, rather than the Bushes. Instead, King\u2019s murder set off a wave of rioting that benefited Nixon\u2019s law-and-order rhetoric. With no assassination, there might have been no President Nixon.", "Without Nixon there would have been no Watergate and, more importantly, perhaps no political realignment in the South, during which white Democrats abandoned the Democratic Party and became solid Republican voters. With no realignment Donald Trump would still be a Democrat, elected president with southern, conservative Democratic votes. There would still be talk in Congress about impeaching him, but it would be from Republicans.", "The second of King\u2019s causes in 1968, the Poor People\u2019s Movement, was even less popular than his stance on Vietnam. King is such an extraordinary figure that his admirers sometimes argue he could have made this dream of democratic socialism work. Yet given America\u2019s long-standing suspicion of left-wing ideas and the visceral anti-communism of the cold-war era, that seems unlikely. King might have become known as a former civil-rights leader who peddled crackpot plans for a living wage, job guarantees and the redistribution of land and capital\u2014ideas that have gained ground lately, but are still outside the political mainstream.", "His third cause, a commitment to improving the lives of African-Americans without resorting to violence, seemed equally shaky in 1968. Throughout the 1960s, civil-rights activists had argued about the utility of violence in pursuing their aims. King\u2019s embrace of non-violence now looks like a triumph of Gandhian wisdom, but at the time it risked looking weak, old-fashioned or out of touch. In his Pulitzer-winning biography, \u201cBearing the Cross\u201d, David Garrow quotes King telling a friend in Memphis that, \u201cmaybe we just have to admit that the day of violence is here, and maybe we just have to give up and let violence take its course.\u201d Paradoxically, King\u2019s murder more or less settled the argument in favour of non-violence. Groups like the Black Panthers, who had marched in California in 1967 bearing rifles, slowly faded away. The cause of racial progress continued peacefully, gradually drawing the support of more and more white Americans.", "Had he lived, King might be remembered not as the man with the dream but as the leader of a failed socialist movement, or the loser in an argument within black activism over the use of force. But the country\u2019s finest speechmaker since Lincoln would have been around to tell Americans what to make of the Rodney King riots, the deaths of so many young black men, and whether sportsmen should have to stand during the national anthem. In fact he might be on cable news right now, being interrupted for breaking-news alerts about a presidential tweet or another school shooting.", "Vincent Harding, a historian and activist who knew King, said that the assassination turned King into a \u201crather smoothed-off, respectable national hero\u201d. Death transformed King from the unpopular leader of a pair of causes that seemed lost into a hero whose example would be taught to schoolchildren of any colour. King\u2019s murder was an act of pure evil. Yet his martyrdom helped change America for the better."], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["kings", "murder", "vietnam", "white", "dream", "violence", "republican", "americans", "president", "different", "king", "1968"], "id": "068f7278-4e73-393a-b50d-c54866adb1b7", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2018/07/05/a-different-dream"}
