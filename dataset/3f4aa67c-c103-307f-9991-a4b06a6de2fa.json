I\u2019m Kara Swisher and I\u2019m recording on Wednesday evening in the middle of a coup attempt in our nation\u2019s Capitol. As of right now, Washington is on lockdown with senators and members of the House sheltering in place after a mob incited by President Trump stormed Congress. The attack shocked the nation. But if you\u2019re a far-right Trump supporter, if you think the election was stolen, then you may have been planning for this day. And you may have been planning for it on social media. Three decades ago and 30 miles away, I started covering the nascent internet. I was at the headquarters of a company interviewing a group of quilters who had met online and made a quilt together without ever meeting in person. It was sweet and hopeful, which is how it was back then in tech. The company was America Online. Well, America is online now, and it\u2019s been a downward slide into what can only be called a toxic swamp of hate, conspiracy theories, and anger, all presided over by the troller-in-chief, Donald Trump. Today he egged on the crowd of his MAGA fans to march over to the Capitol, and Trump continued to add fuel to the fire via Twitter, just as his successor Joe Biden was in the process of being certified as president. I wish I could say I was surprised. On my other podcast yesterday, I said that I expected violence at the Capitol after I spent time on a variety of social media sites where you could see it coming. In my first column for The New York Times, I wrote about all these tech field communications tools and their dangers. I said, quote, \u201d[They] have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age... They have mutated human communication, so that connecting people has too often become about pitting them against one another, and turbocharged that discord into an unprecedented and damaging volume. They have weaponized social media. They have weaponized the First Amendment. They have weaponized civil discourse. And they have weaponized, most of all, politics.\u201d When I wrote that column in 2018, a new social media site was just launching. It was called Parler. Now it\u2019s called Parler. Parler has since become the darling of the far right. Ted Cruz is active on it. He says Parler quote, \u201cgets what free speech is all about.\u201d The site is nowhere near as big or powerful as Twitter or Facebook, but it\u2019s a platform of choice for some people who, frankly, scare me. Parler\u2019s C.E.O is a guy named John Matze. I\u2019ve been wanting to have him on the show. And as I watched the insurrection unfold on TV, I thought now\u2019s the time. We spoke for a while about the dangerous power he\u2019s unleashing. By the way, minutes after we hung up, Twitter locked Trump\u2019s feed temporarily and threatened to take more drastic action if he continued to violate its rules. That\u2019s something Matze suggested Parler would not do. Here\u2019s our conversation about that and more. So there is an effective coup attempt happening in our nation\u2019s Capitol to stop a vote that was occurring there. It moved all the legislators out of the Capitol. Are you surprised at all by what\u2019s happening?", "john matze", "Well, I don\u2019t know what I would describe it as. I guess I\u2019m kind of surprised, because it\u2019s surreal, if that makes sense.", "kara swisher", "Sure is.", "john matze", "But I\u2019m also not surprised, because if you put yourself in the shoes of a lot of these people, they feel like an election was stolen once. And then they feel like an election was stolen again yesterday. And so they are left thinking, well, what am I supposed to do? So they hear this rhetoric. They don\u2019t believe, they don\u2019t trust the results. They feel like they\u2019ve been fed a lot of propaganda. They feel like they can\u2019t trust the media.", "kara swisher", "Well, they certainly have. But go ahead.", "john matze", "Well, I believe that almost everybody is. But you have to be able to judge that for yourself and make your own decisions, weigh the pros and cons. But that being said, a lot of these people feel like they can\u2019t trust anything, but they do genuinely believe that the election was stolen. So if you put yourself in their shoes, I\u2019m not exactly surprised they\u2019re doing this.", "kara swisher", "All right, John, if you feel like you\u2019re in a restaurant, you don\u2019t get good service, do you feel like you can break the windows and invade people\u2019s homes? I\u2019m just curious that this just doesn\u2019t seem to be \u2014", "john matze", "No, I go home.", "kara swisher", "Yes, exactly.", "john matze", "In fact, I don\u2019t even like going to restaurants. I like staying home.", "kara swisher", "OK, but let me ask you a question. This is not this \u2014 first of all, feelings aren\u2019t facts. And I want to know if you were watching it on Parler, which is a site you run, which you are the C.E.O of. Have you been seeing this organizational stuff?", "john matze", "Well, you know I don\u2019t necessarily monitor a lot of this stuff. I participate and watch Parler just as anybody else does. If people are breaking the law, violating our terms of service, or doing anything illegal, we would definitely get involved. But if people are just trying to assemble or they\u2019re trying to put together an event \u2014 which is what a lot of people tried to do at this event today \u2014 there\u2019s nothing particularly wrong about that. Now I had noticed a long time ago that there were some accounts trying to get people off to private telegram groups and things of that nature, where Parler couldn\u2019t witness what\u2019s going on or it wouldn\u2019t be public. But, you know, for the most part, I haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of illegal activity. And if it was, it would have been taken down. We\u2019ve had multiple doxxing attempts that have resulted in some of the people organizing these movements have actually had their accounts taken down due to doxxing. But organizing an event isn\u2019t illegal.", "kara swisher", "Understandably, and organizing a peaceful protest is also perfectly fine. A lot of the stuff I saw Parler was actually organizing bringing guns into the district \u2014 which is illegal, as you know, carrying guns \u2014 organizing exactly what\u2019s happened on the Capitol. How did you deal with that?", "john matze", "Well, the way we work on our platform is we put everything to a community jury. So everyone\u2019s judged by a jury of their peers in determining whether the action is illegal or against our rules. And so if reported, it goes to a jury of people\u2019s peers. And if it\u2019s deemed illegal, promptly deleted. But, you know, the jury of five people get to decide. And it\u2019s a random jury, so they don\u2019t know each other. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re voting. They just get the independent facts of the situation and they make their own judgment call. We\u2019ve actually been inviting journalists and other people to join the jury as well, so that we have a nice transparent jury system.", "kara swisher", "All right, but what I\u2019m asking specifically, there were specific postings and quite a few of them \u2014 and we have dozens of them to look at \u2014 which is talking about doing just what they did today on the Capitol. Were these adjudicated, if that\u2019s the right word? And if they pass muster, is that a particularly good jury, if these are illegal activities what\u2019s happening right now in the Capitol?", "john matze", "Well, for violence, and advocation of violence, or violence specifically, it needs to be a clear and imminent threat. And I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019ve been witnessing what happened today a little bit, but I\u2019m not really too much in the weeds on this stuff. I haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of illegal activity. Maybe there has been some, but it\u2019s a minority of the cases.", "kara swisher", "Well, I do believe having been to the Capitol dozens of times that if you do anything that not go through their metal detectors, you don\u2019t follow the rules, you break windows, you run through the other people\u2019s offices, you take pictures of their offices, you sit-in their seats, I believe that\u2019s all illegal.", "john matze", "Yes, but I do want to push back a little bit on this here. Because if you go back six months ago, you had a lot of the media putting out full stop \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 saying in defense of looting where they came out and said it\u2019s acceptable to loot. And looting and all this stuff needs to be \u2014 there\u2019s even a book written and promoted. But it was during the time when there was a lot of people on the left looting and angry.", "kara swisher", "The New York Times does not promote \u2014 I\u2019m going to push back on you. The New York Times was absolutely not promoting looting. That is untrue.", "john matze", "Well, my \u2014", "kara swisher", "You can say it. This is \u2014 you can say it. It\u2019s untrue. It\u2019s 100% true. It\u2019s not true.", "john matze", "Well, I don\u2019t know the specifics of the \u2014", "kara swisher", "No, don\u2019t do the I don\u2019t know the specifics. You don\u2019t know the specifics. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s untrue. And unless you have a specific, you can\u2019t make that allegation. I\u2019m talking about the activities today. And I do want to understand what was happening on your platform. And again, it was happening on Twitter and other places. But do you feel any responsibility if people were organizing to \u2014 protests are very different. And you\u2019re absolutely right. Everyone gets to run around with whatever flag they want to fly, and whatever coat they want to wear, and whatever chant they want to have. But going into the Capitol building to do this, if it was organized on your site, what should happen on your site?", "john matze", "Look, if it was illegally organized and against the law and what they were doing, they would have gotten it taken down. But I don\u2019t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we\u2019re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law. So if people are organizing something, that\u2019s more of a problem of people are upset. They feel disenfranchised. They need their leaders to stop provoking this partisan hate. They need to come together and have a discussion on a place like Parler.", "kara swisher", "So I want to finish this with specifically there were a lot of examples of people calling for what they did today. Do you believe what happened within the Capitol today, if you were the judge and jury as you do on Parler, would this be the thing you would think is legal? Not that they feel bad and I think I\u2019ll break something. Do you think this was legal what happened to the people that moved into the Capitol and trespassed?", "john matze", "I mean, it\u2019s obviously illegal. What their actions that they took, yes.", "kara swisher", "And if they were organizing on your platform, do you think it should have been taken down on Parler? It sounds like you do not think that.", "john matze", "If they were organizing specifically saying, tomorrow, we\u2019re going to go out and we\u2019re going to bust this window. Hey, by the way, guys, there\u2019s an area we can climb up in and break into that window. If that is what they were doing, yeah, of course, that would get taken down. But that\u2019s not what people were doing. They were saying let\u2019s peacefully protest for the President. That\u2019s what a lot of people were saying, not just on Parler, on Twitter, on Facebook, on every major social network. And including ones that we will have no ability to police. Now you have to take into consideration that everything on Parler, Twitter, Facebook, all of these places are very public. But what happens when people use direct messaging apps that are two-way encrypted that even the service providers don\u2019t know what these groups are talking about? How do you address those situations? And you can\u2019t do it using authoritarian measures. You must do it using the media, the politicians, the leaders. They have to come out and have a discussion with the people and show that they care, that they want to discuss these things. And that is why I think Parler provides those platforms to do that. Because people can come out and transparently say what they believe and they can be transparently addressed by those in charge. However, there is a large movement of people who want to push for authoritarian measures and censorship. And it just puts gas right on the fire. And we need people to come out and set examples.", "kara swisher", "So your point that they get driven underground if they don\u2019t have a wide open space, public space to do this in?", "john matze", "Yeah, I think so. Do you disagree?", "kara swisher", "Sometimes. Sometimes not. It depends. I think if people are actually calling for civil war on your platform or pushing egregious lies that lead to violence, down it goes. It\u2019s very \u2014 and I think you should be responsible for it, not some jury. I think you have some responsibility for what\u2019s happened on your platform.", "john matze", "Well, how would you do it then? Would you put together an authoritarian task force or?", "kara swisher", "I think it\u2019s super \u2014 well, if you want to use the word authoritarian, everybody has rules. Restaurants have rules. Retail places have rules. Everywhere you go in life has different rules that you adhere to or you don\u2019t. Or you don\u2019t do it and then you suffer the consequences.", "john matze", "I think that you have a few options. One is you can be proactively monitoring, and spying on people, and surveilling them, which is what some platforms have decided to do to some extent. Although, most surveillance is limited into capturing data about people in order to sell products and manipulate them. But nobody has yet really done the surveillance thing, as far as I\u2019m aware, in order to stifle speech. They have gotten into it a little bit. But it\u2019s a difficult question. You have 12 million, 13 million people on Parler, for example, and you can\u2019t watch what all of them are doing. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s our obligation to. Society needs to work together in a democracy to get through things like this.", "kara swisher", "Let\u2019s talk about \u2014 so how do you want to monitor your site? Not at all? Let people say civil war? Let people say \u2014 you think that\u2019s great, you think that\u2019s \u2014 not great \u2014 what do you think when people are saying it\u2019s time for civil war, I\u2019m bringing my guns to Washington? You think you just let them say that?", "john matze", "Well, if it was up to me we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation where two sides hate each other this much.", "kara swisher", "I get it, but here we find ourselves.", "john matze", "Whether or not it\u2019s Parler, it\u2019s Twitter, it\u2019s Facebook, it\u2019s Google, it\u2019s telegram, WhatsApp, whatever it might be, you can\u2019t stop people and change their opinions by force by censoring them. They\u2019ll just go somewhere else and do it. So as long as it is legal, it\u2019s allowed.", "kara swisher", "We\u2019ll be back in a minute. So when did you become aware of the events at the Capitol?", "john matze", "I saw it early around, I guess, my time would be 10, 11 AM my time. So a few hours ago. I was alerted when \u2014 because I was on conference calls all morning. And so by the time I found out about this, it was due to a traffic spike. And I was like, what do you mean traffic spike? It\u2019s a random Wednesday. What are you talking about?", "kara swisher", "But you had a server outage earlier today. What happened? Was it because of the slam of people trying to use it or what?", "john matze", "Well, we\u2019re in the middle of an upgrade. So it\u2019s not an ideal time. We\u2019re trying to optimize a few things. And so then you get an influx of millions of people, 3 million people by two o\u2019clock Eastern today.", "kara swisher", "Then what were they doing? What were they doing? Were they talking about going into the Capitol or were they talking about protesting?", "john matze", "No, most people were watching it. Most people were trying to understand what was happening. They were like, where are the videos? What\u2019s going on? What are people doing? It\u2019s interesting, the reaction is half of the people were actually \u2014 that I was following, so I follow a diverse set of people. I follow some very hardcore progressives, some conservatives, and a lot of libertarians, and some people were apolitical. A lot of the reactions that I saw at first had been condoning what\u2019s going on. And then some people paranoid saying, oh, this isn\u2019t really Trump supporters. It\u2019s a bunch of \u2014 this is organized by some conspiracy theories, which I think are completely ludicrous, because \u2014", "kara swisher", "That was Trump supporters.", "john matze", "I think people have been stoking themselves up for something like this.", "kara swisher", "So when you think about these conspiracy theories, you think you should just let them fly, and let this autonomous jury, or let the discussion just have out?", "john matze", "It\u2019s not against the law to have a conspiracy theory. But if they have a conspiracy theory, people should call them out for it. And people should build their own reputations as being a reliable source, rather than us trying to become the reliable source. And so that\u2019s a huge differentiator between Parler and Twitter and Facebook is they want to be the authoritative reliable source of information.", "kara swisher", ", Well let\u2019s work through your guidelines then. What are your community guidelines exactly?", "john matze", "Well, we have a few major rules. But let\u2019s go over the most violated or the most kind of touched upon.", "kara swisher", "Yes, all right. Let\u2019s talk about that.", "john matze", "The one that we have absolutely no tolerance for under any circumstances is doxxing personal information like home addresses, phone numbers, unless is like a call your Congressman kind of thing. You can put their phone number there or send them a letter to their P.O. box.", "kara swisher", "So no home addresses. Also a problem on all the other platforms too.", "john matze", "Yes, but that, we don\u2019t even warn people. That just gets taken down immediately, because that\u2019s an imminent threat. Like you can\u2019t \u2014 what are you doing? You\u2019re posting someone\u2019s home address, so what? You can mail them cookies? No, they want to hurt them.", "kara swisher", "So, that\u2019s one, doxxing or personal information.", "john matze", "Yes, and then illegal activity, of course, will get taken down, as long as it\u2019s illegal. And so the difference is if someone says something mean or violent, it\u2019s not necessarily illegal. It has to cross that threshold.", "kara swisher", "You said a majority of the activity today was observational, but not all of it. Can you acknowledge that people today do use Parler to go organize and plan to go to the Capitol?", "john matze", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really good for planning events, to be honest. The way the format\u2019s set up, it\u2019s more for announcements like, hey, we have an event. The planning was mostly done on things like Facebook groups, or like a telegram, or a WhatsApp would probably be better for planning.", "kara swisher", "But are they using it to plan? Do you think they use it for organization?", "john matze", "I\u2019m sure some people do.", "kara swisher", "OK. Can you acknowledge that people in the Capitol right now are, in fact, violating the law? They\u2019re carrying guns, breaking windows. Are they threatening law and order from your perspective?", "john matze", "I\u2019m sure some are.", "kara swisher", "OK.", "john matze", "I haven\u2019t actually seen any videos of anybody protesting that had guns. I saw a protester that got shot. But I didn\u2019t actually see the protesters doing any shooting. I haven\u2019t seen any videos like that yet.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, a woman has now died.", "john matze", "Yes, she was a protester I believe, though. She was shot by the \u2014 I think it was the \u2014 I don\u2019t know who she was shot by, though. I didn\u2019t actually see that.", "kara swisher", "How long does it take between a message threatening violence and sedition, for example, or anything else, how long does it take to flag to you as a C.E.O that gets to you? Do these things get to you? Because they do get to Jack Dorsey, a lot of the more problematic ones.", "john matze", "Sometimes they do. It just depends on how nasty, how violent, and whether or not the authorities were needed to get involved. And it just depends on a lot of factors and how many people it reached. If you come out and you say something incredibly nasty and violent, but you get no votes and no impressions, the likelihood of being on the platform longer is higher, because we aren\u2019t surveilling people or figuring it on our own.", "kara swisher", "But you don\u2019t have any algorithmic catching of words and things like that? Like I\u2019m going to kill blank kind of thing.", "john matze", "No, the only algorithm that we have for catching words is for pornography and nudity and things like that.", "kara swisher", "But it takes 48 hours, because of the fully automated jury process. Is that correct?", "john matze", "It can. It depends on how inundated the jury is and how many jurors are active. Most days, it takes less than five minutes. But some days, like today, it\u2019ll probably take 24 hours.", "kara swisher", "That\u2019s a long time on the internet, long enough for violence. Does that policy work? Do you see it scaling as you get larger?", "john matze", "It has scaled well so far. It\u2019s scaled a lot better than trying to hire out teams. Because if you imagine, if we have to hire people, they\u2019ve got to go through a period of interviews, and background checks, and building up a whole team. And Facebook, I don\u2019t know how many people they have. But I do know that I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as 20,000 people doing the moderation. And so scaling out teams like that, it\u2019s very time-consuming, and difficult, and expensive.", "kara swisher", "Well, yes, but you could anticipate you might need them. These self-appointed juries, they\u2019re judging millions of people?", "john matze", "Yes, I don\u2019t know how many people at this point are part of the jury. I have asked to grow the jury over 2000 people. I don\u2019t know how far along we are getting it to that size, but it\u2019s pretty substantial.", "kara swisher", "Do you know how many flags today? Do you have any idea of how many flags today?", "john matze", "I\u2019d have to ask the database engineer.", "kara swisher", "They spend a lot of time picking juries, so they are somewhat neutral. Although, it\u2019s almost impossible to do it. How do you do that if most of the people on your site are of the same political bent, which is more conservative?", "john matze", "Well, we have a lot of jury training, and jurors are picked by their tenure. and there\u2019s very specific things that they \u2014 buttons they have to select to categorize the violation. That being said, we also have internal metrics. So if somebody is marking more things or less things as a violation compared to the norm or they\u2019re outliers, then they get kicked from the jury pool.", "kara swisher", "So what would be illegal? So saying, let\u2019s raid the Capital would not be illegal just because they\u2019re saying it?", "john matze", "Well, it\u2019s hard to get into the specifics. But I can give you an example. I guess, if you said I know where you live. I\u2019m going to come to your house and I\u2019m going to hurt you. That\u2019s a clear and imminent threat, because you clearly know where that person lives. You\u2019re going to their house. You\u2019re going to hurt them. So that is an example. But I don\u2019t generally like to get into specifics, because it can get really touchy.", "kara swisher", "Right, but community guidelines around harmful and violent speech, that you would consider harmful and violent speech?", "john matze", "Yes. Yeah, anything that presents a clear and imminent threat, that would be violent.", "kara swisher", "And how do you compare it to what\u2019s happening \u2014 I\u2019m going to use Twitter as the example, because I think a lot of people don\u2019t focus on you as a Facebook killer, more as a Twitter rival, essentially. How do you consider what they\u2019re doing with the labeling of President Trump?", "john matze", "I think it\u2019s inappropriate. I do. And I think it undermines a lot of what they\u2019re trying to do. And so you have to put yourself in the shoes of the people who are following President Trump. And so if you put yourself in their shoes \u2014 which, by the way, I am not a conservative, and I\u2019m not a Trump voter. In fact, I didn\u2019t even vote in the last election. I just didn\u2019t want to bring myself to doing it. But I just I can\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want to participate in all of this.", "kara swisher", "Because?", "john matze", "Well, one, I think I actually am pretty neutral on a lot of this stuff. And two, it just feels like a mess. I don\u2019t really want to participate in this mess.", "kara swisher", "In a mess?", "john matze", "Yeah.", "kara swisher", "Gosh, it feels like a privilege to me.", "john matze", "Well, I don\u2019t know. This whole year has been a mess. A lot of people fighting. One side fighting each other. And it\u2019s like I\u2019ll call out the people on either side. And frankly, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s my place to weigh in. And so that by being neutral and actually kind of living a little bit more neutral, I think it\u2019s \u2014", "kara swisher", "All right, let me make something a little easier. What happened to Alex Jones on the platforms? He was he was active for a long time until Apple moved and then the rest of them moved rather quickly afterwards. How do you how do you look at someone like an Alex Jones and what happened with Twitter, Apple, Facebook, and others?", "john matze", "Well, I think it\u2019s a little bit wrong that \u2014 not just a little bit, it\u2019s extremely wrong that everybody just purged him all at the same time. If he says something crazy \u2014 I mean, he says a lot of crazy stuff all the time \u2014 that\u2019s a great time to reinforce for somebody who\u2019s trusted with the mainstream and elsewhere to reinforce hey, this guy is crazy. These ideas are crazy. Look at what he just said. That\u2019s a great opportunity. But purging him \u2014 the people who follow him, A, they want more. They get more devout in my opinion. And furthermore, it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s like a collective digital kind of purging of him, and his existence, and his ideas. It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s authoritarian and it\u2019s wrong that everybody, once one person bans them, everybody bans them. It\u2019s horrible. It sets a horrible precedence.", "kara swisher", "So you would have left him up? You\u2019re not of the school that thinks that as he gets to say more, he converts more people, the lies he tells get worse, and that more people start to believe his conspiracy theories?", "john matze", "Well, why should I weigh in as an authoritative source, as an authority figure? What if I, as a person, was against a certain group whether race, religion, or whatever it was, and we aimed our platform \u2014 and not just me let\u2019s say, Mark Zuckerberg, let\u2019s say Jack Dorsey, any of the other tech companies. What if any of us said, we don\u2019t like this particular religion, or race, or group, and then targeted them and took them off the internet? How horrible would that be?", "kara swisher", "So tell me, when you talk about people taking things down off of things like Facebook, or Twitter labeling things, a lot of people say that\u2019s a free speech violation. In fact, they are private companies and they can do whatever they want. Do you think it\u2019s OK that they do that? Do you think they should be allowed to do that given these are private companies and not public squares?", "john matze", "Well, it\u2019s a little bit of a sticky situation, because you can\u2019t violate the company\u2019s right to free speech. They don\u2019t have to do business with everybody. You can\u2019t force somebody to work for somebody else. But at the same time, we are in a country that likes free speech. So you are limited on what you can say online. A lot of people go there thinking that it\u2019s an open place, a town forum. They think that they\u2019re private, or at least, that their information is not being stored and sold and all of this. But they\u2019re also wrong. And so what we wanted to do is be a community town square for free speech. As long as it\u2019s legal, they can go ahead and talk about it online. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve marketed ourselves. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve behaved. That\u2019s how we are.", "kara swisher", "All right, now you say you\u2019re neutral, but your members are primarily conservative at this moment. And you do want to make it bigger \u2014 I\u2019ve seen lots of interviews where you talked about it \u2014 but your co-founder is Rebekah Mercer, a major Republican Party donor, very early Trump backer. Are you actually neutral or are you seeing right now, as a right-wing publisher, all the people affiliated with you are more on the right? How do you change that? And tell me about the ownership structure.", "john matze", "Well, today everybody \u2014 a lot of people on the platform are on the right. And we have appealed to people on the right, because they are primarily the victims of online censorship right now, the way I see it.", "kara swisher", "You know there\u2019s no actual evidence of that happening, just them saying it?", "john matze", "There\u2019s also no actual evidence of it not happening either.", "kara swisher", "Oh my God. Come on. That\u2019s Loch Ness Monster talk.", "john matze", "You can\u2019t say that, though. You can\u2019t say that.", "kara swisher", "I would like to see evidence of it. Just like I\u2019d like to see more evidence of widespread election fraud, which, of course, you don\u2019t see in courts of \u2014 courts already are saying, too.", "john matze", "Well, yeah. So I don\u2019t want to get into the election thing. But let\u2019s put it this way, people feel that they are being censored online and they can\u2019t get their voice out.", "kara swisher", "Again, feelings are not facts. But OK. They\u2019re over there. They\u2019ve moved over there. They\u2019re hurt by something that Twitter\u2019s done, although they certainly can\u2019t resist it on many levels.", "john matze", "In capitalism, we vote with our dollars. So \u2014 and online and on social media, our presence equates to our dollars, because being able to present ads allows people to sell products to them. And therefore by voting with their feed, they are essentially voting with in this example. And so their feelings do matter in this case, because whether or not it\u2019s factually happening, that\u2019s what they feel. And the way I see it, is today it is a conservative issue. A lot of conservatives feel that they are censored, and they\u2019re not living up to their free speech values. Tomorrow, it may be the left. Today, it may be a foreign country, which there has been other foreign countries that have had these issues too. We saw a large influx from Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ve seen a large influx in Brazil. So there are other countries where people feel that they are being censored online too.", "kara swisher", "OK. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re appealing to? So your ownership, Rebekah Mercer \u2014 who else is ownership? Is it Dan Bongino?", "john matze", "So primarily, it\u2019s me and our co-founders, which would be Jared and Rebekah. And then you have Dan Bongino is also an investor. And you also have Jeffrey Wernick in his group, who\u2019ve publicly come out. And that\u2019s basically the extent of everybody involved in the company.", "kara swisher", "Is she the principal funder in this case, financial funder?", "john matze", "At this point, no. We have more people involved in the financing of the company. And now we have actually ad revenue doing a lot of our \u2014 covering a lot of our monthly overhead.", "kara swisher", "So who are your advertisers right now then?", "john matze", "Anybody can create an ad as long as they have a badge on the platform. So the badge system is where they prove their identity to us. Once they do that, they can then advertise.", "kara swisher", "What are the most of the ads? What do they focus on?", "john matze", "Most of it\u2019s national brands. So it\u2019s anything that can be sold anywhere in the U.S. for the most part.", "kara swisher", "Who\u2019s your biggest advertiser?", "john matze", "Might be hard to say. We\u2019ve had a lot of political ads.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, I bet.", "john matze", "It\u2019s been a large, probably the largest sector.", "kara swisher", "But more right or left?", "john matze", "Republican leaning.", "kara swisher", "Republican. How do you then assess President Trump\u2019s behavior online on social media, especially Twitter?", "john matze", "I think actually they should not flag his stuff. They shouldn\u2019t censor him. They shouldn\u2019t let him \u2014 force them to hold back.", "kara swisher", "Well, they didn\u2019t for a very long time, for most of his \u2014", "john matze", "No, they didn\u2019t for a while, but he\u2019s also ramped up more recently too. But if you don\u2019t get involved, if you don\u2019t censor, if you don\u2019t \u2014 you just let him do what he wants, then the public can judge for themselves. Don\u2019t weigh in. Just sit there and say, hey, that\u2019s what he said. What do you guys think?", "kara swisher", "What about him saying things right now that seem to be inciting violence?", "john matze", "OK, well, let\u2019s break it down this way. Do you feel that Twitter has a responsibility to get involved?", "kara swisher", "Right at this moment where there is violence happening and he seems to be encouraging it? Yes, I do think there is some role. But I would say, when he lies incessantly, flagging it is not \u2014 it\u2019s not censoring. It\u2019s linking to better information. And that\u2019s their judgment, because it\u2019s their company.", "john matze", "Yeah, but isn\u2019t that kind of the role of a journalist and a publication?", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s their company. The New York Times doesn\u2019t print every crazy email we get, do we? We print the ones we think are valuable.", "john matze", "But they\u2019ve billed themselves as a free place for people to contribute \u2014", "kara swisher", "Not anymore.", "john matze", "\u2014 their own content.", "kara swisher", "No.", "john matze", "They did historically, but maybe not anymore.", "kara swisher", "Historically. You\u2019re absolutely right.", "john matze", "But then don\u2019t you view Twitter, then, in that case, as a competitor of \u2014", "kara swisher", "Yes, I think they\u2019re a media company. I\u2019ve always thought that. I think Facebook is too. I think they like to have it both ways. On ParlerTakes right now, which is the one on Twitter that talks about Parler, things that are on Parler, a video of MAGA-ers chanting hang Mike Pence, one user Joel Fischer is saying, looks like Republicans have full control of the House and the Senate. Now there\u2019s a collection of a fund to bail out a member of the Proud Boys who\u2019s been arrested. Is this normal day?", "john matze", "No, that\u2019s pretty extreme. I think by any metric that\u2019s pretty extreme.", "kara swisher", "Right. Hang Mike Pence should stay there?", "john matze", "I don\u2019t know. They\u2019d have to report it.", "kara swisher", "What do you think? If you were the jury?", "john matze", "I would take it down. If I was a jury member, I\u2019d vote against it. But that\u2019s my opinion. So you\u2019ve got to get four out of five people to share my view. I think they probably would. But it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s a clear and imminent threat of danger, considering they\u2019re literally raiding buildings and then \u2014", "kara swisher", "Talking about hanging.", "john matze", "Spreading a message to hurt somebody.", "kara swisher", "OK. You said you didn\u2019t vote in the last election. Will you vote in the next one?", "john matze", "Probably not.", "kara swisher", "Because?", "john matze", "I don\u2019t know. I kind of subscribe to the theory that, I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to word this. Let\u2019s see. I don\u2019t know that I really am interested in participating too much in it. One is I\u2019d like to remain neutral, but also I don\u2019t really have a whole lot of confidence in the system. That\u2019s really what it comes down to.", "kara swisher", "Because you don\u2019t believe in the system?", "john matze", "Yeah.", "kara swisher", "So how do you feel today about democracy?", "john matze", "Well, it\u2019s not the idea of democracy. It\u2019s \u2014 because the idea of democracy is a great idea.", "kara swisher", "How do you feel about our democracy today?", "john matze", "I think that we\u2019re destined to go towards more of a socialist progressive state. I think it\u2019s just inevitable, and whether you vote or not, it\u2019s heading that way. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much anybody can do about it.", "kara swisher", "And not an authoritarian, which is another direction?", "john matze", "It could be authoritarian. I\u2019m not sure if it will or will not be. It just depends on who comes into power and how strong-willed they are.", "kara swisher", "All right. Yes, well, we\u2019ll see how that turns out. This great experiment continues, the United States of America. It is sad when you get really \u2014 today, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed on Twitter or not, maybe on Parler \u2014 a lot of foreign leaders just say \u2014 it\u2019s just go look on Twitter.", "john matze", "Oh, they\u2019re probably laughing.", "kara swisher", "Yes, well, laughing is not what I would say they\u2019re doing.", "john matze", "Well, mocking.", "kara swisher"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["thats", "think", "coming", "saw", "opinion", "mob", "dont", "know", "right", "lot", "say", "matzewell", "parler", "im"], "pubDate": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
