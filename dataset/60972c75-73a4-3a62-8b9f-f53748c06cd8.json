After studying economics and design, she\u2019d spent much of her 30s working in user experience at Google. In 2014, a humorous blog post she wrote, \u201c10 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings,\u201d had gone viral, and Cooper quit her job to write and perform comedy full-time. A contract for a book followed six months later. Over six years she did stand-up in New York, released two more humor books, and wrote a pilot that was not produced. Her work had a respectable audience\u2014she had assembled some 50,000 Twitter followers\u2014but not a huge one, and now, at 42, she wondered whether her risky leap had left her in the roadside dust. \u201cIt was kind of a make-or-break year for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI told myself that if I couldn\u2019t get a late-night set I would think about going back to Google.\u201d", "At just the moment when Cooper was working up the steam to give her dream one final push, though, the pandemic lockdowns began. The clubs where she\u2019d performed closed, and she felt her train shiver to a halt. Worried about losing momentum, she turned to social media and started brainstorming new approaches. \u201cI was looking for a funny series that I could do,\u201d she says.", "It was around this time that Cooper noticed President Trump was saying the most extraordinary things live on TV: UV light baths, disinfectant injections, and similar inanities. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t write something better than that,\u201d she says. She decided to lip-synch the statements for TikTok, the algorithmic social network for short user-generated videos. To distinguish her effort, she used multiple camera setups, playing not just the president but baffled figures in his audience. And instead of doing a full-on impersonation, with a tie and a wig, she dressed as herself. Her third book had been called How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men\u2019s Feelings, and she saw the president as one of many swaggering, flimflamming male executives. By adopting this swagger herself, she thought that she could bring the words\u2019 absurdity into relief. She worked at it, hard. \u201cUsually if I can\u2019t get something exactly the way I want it, I\u2019ll give up on it pretty quickly\u2014I call myself a lazy perfectionist,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cBut with the lip-synchs I was willing to put in the effort.\u201d", "In late April, \u201cHow to Medical\u201d appeared on TikTok, with cross-posting on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. As of this writing, it has been watched more than 30 million times. As other videos followed, Cooper made it not just to the late-night shows but to morning TV, afternoon TV, and the virtual red carpet. In September, she released a Netflix sketch special, Sarah Cooper: Everything\u2019s Fine, with a cast of stars who\u2019d admired her work\u2014", "a group ranging from Maya Rudolph to Jon Hamm to Helen Mirren. She spent much of the autumn writing a new TV show for CBS based on her last book. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to go from creating a 60-second TikTok to being able to create a series,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s weird, because without the pandemic I wouldn\u2019t have had these opportunities.\u201d"], "authors": ["Nathan Heller", "Nathan Helle"], "keywords": ["tv", "midst", "videos", "working", "president", "wrote", "cooper", "pandemic", "spark", "tiktok", "write", "darkness", "creative", "book", "writing"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
