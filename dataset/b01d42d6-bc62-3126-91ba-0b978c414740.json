The researchers say the trial results suggest the 15-minute scan could find an extra 40,000 cases of prostate cancer a year in the UK alone.", "Prof Hashim Ahmed, senior author and chair of urology at Imperial College London, said: \u201cProstagram has the potential to form the basis of a fast, mobile national-screening programme for prostate cancer and could be a gamechanger. Prostagram also has the potential to detect more aggressive cancers earlier and pass over the many cancers which don\u2019t need to be diagnosed. By finding these aggressive cancers at the earliest opportunity, men have the opportunity to be offered less invasive treatments with fewer side-effects.\u201d", "The number of prostate cancer deaths in the UK has overtaken the number of breast cancer deaths (approximately 12,000 compared with 11,000), with the national breast screening programme credited with saving an estimated 1,300 lives a year.", "Last year, Prostate Cancer published research showing it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK, with 57,192 new cases in 2018.", "PSA tests are not recommended for screening because they are unreliable and can yield false positive results, while digital rectal examinations (DREs) are invasive, which can put men off being tested, and also have issues with reliability.", "A third of the men in the Prostagram trial were black, which is significant given their increased risk of prostate cancer. One in four black men in the UK will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime compared with one in eight in the general UK population.", "Dr David Eldred-Evans, another researcher and developer of the Prostagram, said: \u201cPlans for a more extensive trial covering 20,000 men are well advanced and will proceed in the coming months subject to funding. If results from this study are similar or better than those revealed today, there is then a clear pathway to the widespread implementation of Prostagram into the general population.\u201d", "Funders of the research, which has been supported by Stephen Fry, include the Wellcome Trust, the BMA foundation for Medical Research and the National Institute of Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre."], "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "keywords": ["save", "scan", "uk", "results", "replace", "exam", "men", "lives", "research", "invasive", "prostate", "trial", "cancers", "prostagram", "screening", "cancer"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
