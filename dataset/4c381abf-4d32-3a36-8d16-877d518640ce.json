The quickest way to up your dating profile game is to get yourself some new profile pictures that showcase you at your best\u2026 but sometimes that is easier said than done.", "We spoke to the UK dating photography expert, Saskia Nelson about how you can exude confidence in your dating profile photos.", "Get comfortable in front of the lens", "OK, this may sound a bit like hard work but it really works. Before you head off on your photoshoot, spend a little time in front of the mirror and practice some different looks and get a feel for what you\u2019re doing with your mouth, chin etc when you like yourself the most in the shot. Then experiment taking some selfies \u2013 don\u2019t worry, you can delete them straight afterwards, but it is a quick and easy first step to getting comfortable in front of the lens.", "Confident people take up room", "Remember a time when you were on fire", "This always helps me. Think back to a time when you were absolutely on fire; it might be that time you delivered the presentation of your life or you stunned an audience with your knockout version of Killing Me Softly. Now remember how you felt about yourself. Amazing wasn\u2019t it? If you can access that feeling and channel it in front of the camera, you\u2019ll just shine in your profile photos. It takes a little practice but it is hugely effective once you\u2019ve got the hang of it.", "Ground yourself", "Grounding techniques are designed to redistribute the energy from your head or mind into your body and doing so has an almost instant calming effect. We want calm confidence in your profile photos (rather than arrogant confidence). I love using grounding techniques before I have to do anything that makes me feel nervous, it immediately relaxes me and feelings of confidence usually follow.", "There are different ways to ground yourself and some are super quick and effective. I like to breathe in and visualise my breath moving through me starting at my feet and moving all the way up my body to my head and back down again. Sometimes just a hand on top of your head for 30 seconds is very grounding. You need to try it to believe it.", "Own the space", "Wear that hot first date outfit", "Once you\u2019re channelling the right mindset, you need the outfits to match. The easiest way to do this is to wear something that you\u2019d usually choose for a hot first date. You know the outfit, the one that curves in all the right places and makes heads turn. That outfit is the one that is going to help build on your new-found confidence.", "Take up space", "Mastering your body language is the quickest way to come across as confident, even if you\u2019re really struggling to feel it. Don\u2019t be afraid to take up room. Confident people take up room. They\u2019re not shrinking themselves to fit in. The easiest way to do this is to use open body language, not closed. Don\u2019t \u2018cross anything\u2019, like arms or legs. Crossed arms, in particular, come across as defensive at best, aggressive at worst. Open arms and hands come across as warm and welcoming. Don\u2019t shrink away from the lens, open yourself up to it. Own the space.", "Hold something", "A really quick and easy way to feel confident is to grab hold of something. It\u2019s human nature to wonder what to do with your hands when you\u2019re having your photo taken so holding something immediately relaxes you. Even better, hold something that tells people a bit more about who you are. That might be a camera, a favourite book, a notebook and pen, a yoga mat, a bike, even your dog (if they\u2019re well behaved).", "Have fun", "If all else fails just aim to connect with your photographer (if they\u2019re good, they\u2019ll make this really easy to do) and make the decision to relax and enjoy their company. Experiment, go with the flow, have fun. Sit, stand, turn, dance, have a laugh and your photographer is bound to get some great natural shots. Fake smiles don\u2019t reach your eyes so the best way to get genuinely happy, laughing shots is to just go for it and have a good time."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["confidence", "exude", "youre", "profile", "dont", "really", "body", "dating", "feel", "way", "head"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
