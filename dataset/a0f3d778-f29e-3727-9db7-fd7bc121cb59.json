About 50km away, across the slate-grey water, naval divers were deploying in rubber boats to retrieve the bodies of two victims still missing after the White Island volcano disaster.", "The first of the six recovered bodies to be identified was that of Krystal Browitt, a 21-year-old Melbourne woman who was on holiday with her family, police said on Saturday.", "But while the community was united in its hope that the mission to retrieve all of the dead would ultimately be a success, divisions are growing over the future of the island \u2013 sacred to M\u0101ori, lucrative for tourism operators \u2013 and the future of their tourist town.", "Whakat\u0101ne endured what many residents have described as its \u201cstrangest, saddest\u201d week after Whakaari, also known as White Island, blew. Large squads of police and the military buzzed down the main street in four-wheel drives, and a 70-strong media pack clogged the waterside, looking for grieving family members who had sought refuge in motels that had stationed security guards in their forecourts.", "She shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted any more. Joshua Kauta, Whakat\u0101ne resident", "At the peak of the excruciating wait for developments, one domestic media outlet approached two foreigners sitting in a cafe. \u201cAre you family?\u201d they asked. \u201cDid you lose someone, or escape the island?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d the pair replied. \u201cWe\u2019re media.\u201d", "Whakaari had showed signs of increasing volatility for weeks before Monday\u2019s eruption. Many locals said they\u2019d held quiet fears about the possibility of an eruption for decades, and that it was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d until it blew during one of the increasingly frequent tours.", "White Island volcano disaster: the victims Read more", "Many M\u0101ori the Observer spoke to said it was wrong for anyone \u2013 tourist or otherwise \u2013 to set foot on the sacred soil of Whakaari, considered a living ancestor by the local tribe, Ng\u0101ti Awa. Some in town expressed anger that the island was administered by private owners, and that tours costing upwards of NZ$250 (\u00a3123) were out of reach of many locals, where the median annual income is NZ$25,000, and unemployment is 11% \u2013 more than double the national rate.", "Joshua Kauta, a 70-year-old Ng\u0101ti Awa local, watched Friday morning\u2019s retrieval operation from the shore: \u201cNone of this should have happened and it scares me to think of the risks those guys have had to take \u2013 anything could happen, she\u2019s unpredictable. She shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted any more.\u201d", "Some M\u0101ori viewed White Island\u2019s eruption on Monday as a sign of the volcano\u2019s dissent and protest; that \u201cshe\u201d \u2013 as locals describe her \u2013 was sick of increasing numbers of tourists and boats traipsing across her bones. And she blew to show humans her power.", "Hiko Merito, 25, said: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have gone on there in the first place. It\u2019s good to watch her from afar, not to actually step on sacred ground.\u201d", "Resident Hinepare Tawa, 32, said she had never been to the island: \u201cMy belief is that Whakaari is a living being, an ancestor, and I don\u2019t believe she is a person to be disturbed. If the island was closed I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it because I really have a problem with capitalising on nature.\u201d", "'Nothing short of miraculous': the long road ahead for injured survivors of White Island Read more", "One commercial fisherman who has fished off White Island for 30 years said he felt the modern world and tourism to the island were \u201cout of touch with nature\u201d and people didn\u2019t know how to read \u2013 or respect \u2013 the land\u2019s natural wonders any more.", "Roy McIntyre, 60, said: \u201cOlder people in town envisaged this when they started doing the tours 30 years ago. Because White Island is White Island \u2013 you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to blow up. I thought it was a matter of time and they were probably lucky to get away with it for this long really.", "\u201cWe\u2019re all horrified but mother nature doesn\u2019t care \u2013 White Island is exactly the same as ever.\u201d", "Tourism is not only the lifeblood of Whakat\u0101ne, it is an economic necessity. It is located in one of the country\u2019s most socio-economically deprived regions, and ringed by small communities whose deprivation has been made famous by director Taika Waititi in his film Boy.", "If tours to White Island are halted permanently \u2013 or the eruption scares people away \u2013 there are few other big money-earners in the region, which is dominated by small-scale agricultural holdings such as avocado plantations, and seafood operators. Many say it is too soon to discuss the local economy, with bodies still on the island. But those in the tourism industry who have suspended operations while the search is ongoing say they\u2019re nervous that the notoriety may stain their town forever.", "\u201cIt must be one of our largest tourism disasters, it\u2019s major for our small town and the country\u2019s tourism industry as a whole,\u201d said Phil van Dusschoten from Diveworks Charters Fishing and Diving, who has worked off White Island for 24 years.", "\u201cLike anything, I guess, to do with nature, if you\u2019re going to put more people out there, more frequently, in greater numbers, over a longer period of time \u2013 it is always going to increase the chances of something happening. We\u2019re still learning about volcanoes all the time; to have only a second\u2019s notice, I suppose we just can\u2019t account for it.\u201d", "As the days passed since Monday\u2019s eruption, and the bodies remained on the island, unease permeated the town. The grieving process was suspended and disquiet reigned. In every restaurant and every cafe and every conversation on the town wharf, Whakaari was the only word, and people\u2019s gazes were drawn to the eastern horizon, where Whakaari could be glimpsed through the summer haze. Locals who have grown up in the volcano\u2019s shadow say they always knew of her power, and were waiting for the day she would blow in protest, in fury.", "Some have made the point that New Zealand is a volcanic country, and many towns and cities have been built on active plateaus, including Auckland. But White Island is different, locals say. With its distance from the shore and the ease with which the crater is accessed, as well as her beauty, she is a national taonga \u2013 treasure \u2013 and there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d about selling tours to a jewel of Aotearoa."], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["whakaari", "town", "say", "eruption", "volcano", "blew", "m\u0101ori", "white", "tourism", "locals", "granted", "taken", "shouldnt", "tours", "island"], "id": "a0f3d778-f29e-3727-9db7-fd7bc121cb59", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "title": "'She shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted': White Island after the volcano blew"}
