Their only children, aged 27, 26 and 21 respectively, have just spent 35 days, nine hours and nine minutes in a 28ft boat, travelling 2,720 nautical miles from the Canaries in the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.", "They came third, breaking the record for three rowers by six days, and in the process becoming the first three brothers, and the youngest trio, to make the trip. \u201cI wonder how their mother feels,\u201d said Kelly Carmichael, mother of another competitor in a Royal Navy team the MacLeans beat to the finish line. Sheila, who was helping to tidy up the boat on Friday, laughed it off: \u201cI had such a quiet Christmas; I want them to go out into the mid-Atlantic every year.\u201d", "The brothers\u2019 boat, Broar, was loudly welcomed into the dour 18th-century surroundings of Nelson\u2019s Dockyard, Antigua by a set of very modern hornblowers, a line of super-yachts at anchor.", "By the standards of the race, the MacLeans had it relatively easy. Fortitude IV, the British foursome who won the race, had capsized stern over bow and rolled during the crossing, which one of the team described as \u201cstartling\u201d.", "Meanwhile Sam Coxon, who was on Ocean5, the boat that arrived 10 hours behind the MacLeans, stepped on to the wharf with a long-harboured plan to go down on one knee to his girlfriend Natasha, only to find he couldn\u2019t, because, he said, \u201cmy knees were so wobbly\u201d. He proposed anyway.", "Rowing the Atlantic is increasingly popular, although fewer people have made the crossing than have climbed Everest. Thirty five boats competed this time.", "The brothers, who grew up in Edinburgh, spent their summers in Sutherland in the far north of Scotland. Jamie plays the bagpipes, Ewan the guitar and Lachlan an accordion, and they\u2019re a striking lot, with sun-bleached hair and green eyes.", "The challenge was Lachlan\u2019s idea, with Jamie first on board. \u201cThen Ewan was like, \u2018Lads, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m not going to be able to live through any future family Christmases if you guys do this and I\u2019m the odd one out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie.", "Nine out of 10 teams that register for the race don\u2019t make it to the starting line. \u201cIt costs around \u00a3120,000,\u201d said Lachlan. \u201cTo raise that sort of money when we are two students and one young professional, it\u2019s quite a challenge.\u201d They are also raising money for the charities Feedback Madagascar and Children First.", "They found sponsors and bought a secondhand boat and patched it up.\u201cWe spent so much time working on the boat that we knew the whole thing inside out,\u201d said Ewan.", "The Dyson design engineer believes this gave them an edge. He made innovations: a streamlined keel, lighter bedding made by his mother. \u201cBeing brothers was hands down the biggest advantage though,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe get on so well.\u201d When the cables for their iPhones didn\u2019t stand up to the conditions, they couldn\u2019t listen to music or podcasts. \u201cThat was a big thing because it meant we talked,\u201d said Lachlan.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The brothers celebrate their achievement on arrival in Antigua. Photograph: Atlantic Campaigns/PA", "\u201cWe had some great conversations,\u201d said Jamie, as Lachlan added: \u201cWe talked about everything, from our childhood, through to our projects, to the future.\u201d Ewan then interjected. \u201cOur life plans.\u201d", "Lachlan is studying philosophy at the University of Glasgow, while Jamie studies architecture at Glasgow School of Art, although this experience may take them in new directions. They agree they will definitely do something else together.", "Often long-distance rowers fall out, forced to fury by the confined space. \u201cOur fall-outs only occurred when there was an accusation of someone eating more than their fair share of porridge,\u201d said Lachlan. Jamie is currently the chief suspect: \u201cI\u2019m the one who has lost the least amount of weight.\u201d", "The welcome they received came as a shock. They believed they had travelled so fast their family wouldn\u2019t make it on time, and that no one would be waiting. \u201cEwan and I were rowing,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d", "When the horns began to sound on the yachts in the harbour, Jamie and Ewan started asking Lachlan what was going on. \u201cAnd then mum popped up beside us,\u201d said Ewan. \u201cShe\u2019d managed to get a lift on a local\u2019s rib.\u201d", "They celebrated their record breaking arrival by eating \u2013 a lot. \u201cWe made a stack of blueberry pancakes and streaky bacon and maple syrup with loads of peanut butter and apple,\u201d said Ewan. Because of the training, it\u2019s been three and a half months since any of them have had a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change tomorrow,\u201d said Lachlan."], "authors": ["Ruaridh Nicoll"], "keywords": ["atlantic", "spent", "help", "rowers", "recordbreaking", "mother", "lachlan", "tell", "jamie", "race", "brothers", "big", "going", "ewan", "boat", "trip"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
