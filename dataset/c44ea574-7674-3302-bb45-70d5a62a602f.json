You\u2019re going to a hotel\u2014to sleep? For the past 12 months, my passport has languished in its drawer, and not a single ticket stub has made its way into my wallet; travel of any kind is a novelty. A night away, simply to knock myself out? Inscrutable to them, highly appealing to me.", "And I wasn\u2019t hitting just any old sack but rather the \u201cworld\u2019s best bed\u201d\u2014at least according to Swedish mattress company H\u00e4stens, which has installed its $200,000 Vividus model (Drake\u2019s a fan of the $400K Grand Vividus) in its Ultimate Sleep Suite at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel. When I arrive, the lobby is predictably muted, devoid of pre-COVID bustle, but it hardly matters. The elevator whisks me to the 43rd floor, where a cross section of the mattress has been installed to better exhibit its contents: horsehair, cotton, wool, flax. I slip into the company\u2019s signature blue-and-white plaid pajamas while the H\u00e4stens Restore app, activated on my phone, issues a soundscape meant to emulate the Orinoco River.", "If this kind of indulgence sounds like something out of a scene from Gossip Girl (Serena van der Woodsen lived at the Palace for a spell, after all), it\u2019s only just a sliver of the sleep-themed programs that are cropping up in hotels and resorts worldwide. Across town, the Equinox Hotel incorporates its proprietary \u201csleep system\u201d\u2014devised with a health-advisory panel\u2014into each of its rooms. Sound-blocking walls, total-blackout window systems, and a magnesium-\u200bsupplement-stocked minibar all set the tone for peaceful repose. (Its temperature-regulating sheets and shams are newly purchasable should you find yourself tempted to stuff them in your suitcase.) At the sand-swept Amangiri resort in Canyon Point, Utah, a \u201cRestorative Sleep Retreat\u201d will take place this November, kicking off with a diagnosis of your natural sleep pattern and continuing with a program of lectures such as \u201cSleep Genetics\u201d or \u201cThe Exhausted Executive\u201d; meanwhile, at Blackberry Farm in Tennessee, a sleep-coaching program is currently under construction. And for those looking to burn their idle frequent-flier miles, the Cadogan Hotel in London has retained a sleep-expert hypnotherapist, available for one-on-one consultations, for when it reopens this spring, while the Royal Scotsman train has partnered with the famed Bamford Haybarn Spa in the Cotswolds to offer an in-transit pressure-point massage service specifically geared to roll you toward better slumber.", "But will people really travel just to sleep when we can move more freely through the world? \u201cSleep has been affected quite badly,\u201d Magdalena Rejman, a H\u00e4stens global product-and-sleep trainer, tells me of one of the many consequences of the COVID era. (According to research published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, the prevalence of sleep problems has risen to 40 percent during the pandemic; up to 75 percent for people who have had the virus.) Rejman is part of the team behind H\u00e4stens\u2019s latest effort to provide the ultimate in sleep luxury: a 15-room sleep hotel in the Portuguese city of Coimbra. A collaboration with hotelier O Valor do Tempo, the oasis features customized pillows, access to a series of \u201cBed Talks\u201d on topics such as neck position, and guided tours of the hotel\u2019s inspiration, the nearby Baroque Biblioteca Joanina, where a colony of bug-eating bats is unleashed every night to help preserve the centuries-old books. \u201cThe blessing in it all,\u201d Rejman says of the period of reflection afforded by the last year, \u201cis that people are starting to look more closely at their own well-being.\u201d (H\u00e4stens\u2019s sales, she notes, are way up.)", "An interior image from H\u00e4stens's new sleep hotel in the Portuguese city of Coimbra, inspired by the tranquil spirit of the nearby Biblioteca Joanina.

It\u2019s hard to fully determine whether the refresh was from the quality of the Z\u2019s or the brief break from my static-yet-hectic pandemic household, but I\u2019m not bothered by the ambiguity. When I checked out in the morning, there was slightly more life in the lobby: clusters of people shivering in sequined gowns, \u201cHappy New Year\u201d tiaras perched above their masked faces. They were filming a scene for an upcoming TV show, and as I watched the boom operators swing their mics, it felt a little like old New York, where such productions were commonplace. It felt a little like, after a good rest, a reset was right around the corner.", "Below, a roundup of some of the products featured and inspired by each hotel\u2019s sleep programming:", "Ultimate Sleep Suite at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel, Manhattan", "H\u00e4stens pajamas in blue check \u20ac223 HASTENS Shop Now H\u00e4stens firm pillow $375 BOSTON LUX BEDS Shop Now", "H\u00e4stens down quilt $710 SLEEP LUXURY BEDS Shop Now Magnolia Melange duvet cover in optic white $129 MAGNOLIA Shop Now", "Equinox Hotel's Sleep System, Manhattan", "Equinox Hotels top mattress $791 EQUINOX HOTELS Shop Now Equinox Hotels pillow $166 EQUINOX HOTELS Shop Now", "The Nue Co.
