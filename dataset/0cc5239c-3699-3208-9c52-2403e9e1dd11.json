They\u2019re too in the habit of sowing distrust. They have disdain for rules \u2014 which in fact made them terrible leaders in the first place, prone to cheating and stealing and grift. \u201cThey leave their organizations in terrible shape, both from a structural and cultural point of view.\u201d As Trump has left the Republican Party. And the country at large.", "Charles O\u2019Reilly, a management professor at Stanford and a frequent collaborator with Chatman, reminded me that Adam Neumann, the disgraced, extravagantly grandiose former C.E.O. of WeWork \u2014 his ambitions included becoming the world\u2019s first trillionaire and living forever \u2014 presented an I.P.O. prospectus that was patently bonkers in a last-ditch effort to save his company. It sounded awfully reminiscent of Trump\u2019s deluded lawsuits. O\u2019Reilly added that most boards fail to stop such leaders, swooping in only when the company is falling apart, because they have too many incentives (money, power) to see them succeed. It sounded an awful lot like Congress. And every former White House official who\u2019s finally speaking up.", "You know where else you can find letter-perfect predictions of the president\u2019s current behavior? Self-help books dedicated to helping people break up with the rotten narcissists in their lives. Seriously. I started burrowing into them in the last few days, more on a daffy hunch than anything else, and it turned out I could basically open any page \u2014 and I mean any page \u2014 and find something relevant to the president\u2019s current behavior: That narcissists lurch between the role of victim and tormentor; that they are minor Shivas, destroyers of worlds; that they howl on and on about betrayal.", "But it was this common thread that stood out: Pathological narcissists make a point of saying that their former partners would have been \u2014 and will be once again \u2014 nothing without them.", "It rhymed with something a White House official recently said Trump was spewing about Pence: \u201cAll day, it was a theme of, \u2018I made this guy, I saved him from a political death, and here he stabbed me in the back.\u2019 \u201d", "I do not by any means wish to suggest that Trump\u2019s disordered personality is the key to understanding his presidency. It is, in some ways, almost tedious, exactly what makes him boring and uncomplicated, as shallow as a spoon.", "But I also think it\u2019s impossible to understand Trump\u2019s behavior without looking at him through the prism of his pathologies, which at this moment are threatening lives. He may have made a robotic statement on Thursday that condemned Wednesday\u2019s violence and implicitly conceded the election. It\u2019s too late. Trump remains a domestic security risk, and he\u2019s made us a target for our enemies. They know that a fragile, unbalanced man is at the helm, his nerves as combustible as dry leaves. He\u2019s desperate, and he\u2019s angry, and he\u2019s baitable. It makes us unsafe. We need to get him out.", "You needn\u2019t be a particularly astute observer of the Trump presidency to understand that his incendiary, hateful policies and rhetoric and mirthful disregard for the law would one day end in violence. But you needn\u2019t be a particularly astute observer of character, either, to see that a man who feels no empathy, exploits ruthlessly, lies reflexively, seeks success at any cost and lives in terror of seeing it vanish would never go quietly.", "The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
