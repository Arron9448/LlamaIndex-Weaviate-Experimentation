Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Across the country, many big cities like New York have struggled to resume even limited in-person instruction, while several, including Los Angeles, have simply given up on the idea, choosing to stick with all-remote education into the spring. Few places have seen as much acrimony over the issue as Chicago, whose public school system is the nation\u2019s third-largest. Now, with 6,000 prekindergarten and special education students preparing to return to the city\u2019s public school buildings on Monday for the first time since March, a question looms: How many teachers will be there to greet them? Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago has argued that giving parents the option of sending their children to school in person is critical to preventing some of the city\u2019s mostly poor and Black and Latino students from falling permanently behind. But the teachers\u2019 union has fiercely resisted the plan, arguing that schools are not safe while the coronavirus is surging. Over the past week, less than 60 percent of the roughly 2,000 teachers who were expected to return to their buildings to prepare for the arrival of students actually showed up. Janice K. Jackson, the chief executive of the school system that serves about 350,000 students, said on Friday that she was optimistic that most teachers would go to work on Monday. She warned that any who stayed home without permission would not be paid, raising the prospect of a heightened clash with the union, which has suggested it may strike if teachers are not permitted to stay home if they want to. \u201cThis is probably the most contentious and unpleasant reopening in terms of how the different sides are interacting with each other,\u201d said Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown who has collected data on coronavirus cases in schools and has argued that reopening schools is safe under many circumstances.

Ulet Ifansasti for The New York Times Indonesia on Monday authorized emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine made by a private Chinese company after late-stage clinical data reaffirmed that the shot is effective, clearing the way for a mass vaccination program to begin in the country. At a news conference, Indonesia\u2019s Food and Drug Administration said it had endorsed the vaccine developed by Sinovac, a Beijing-based vaccine maker, after its interim analysis showed that the inoculation had an efficacy rate of 65.3 percent. Jarir At Thobari, a representative for the National Committee for Drug Assessment, said the efficacy rate of CoronaVac, the name of the Sinovac vaccine, was lower compared with the recent announcements from Sinovac\u2019s trials in Brazil and Turkey because the Indonesia trial, was made up of members of the general public, compared with the volunteers in Brazil and Turkey, who were health care workers or from high-risk groups. A higher number of people who are infected would bring the efficacy rates higher, Dr. At Thobari said. Dr. Rizka Andalucia, the Indonesian F.D.A.\u2019s drug registration director, said that 25 people got Covid-19 from the trial but did not reveal whether they were volunteers or people who got the placebo. He declined to provide the number of both groups in the trial. Brazilian officials said last week that CoronaVac had an efficacy rate of 78 percent. Turkish officials said earlier that the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.25 percent, though it was based on preliminary results from a small clinical trial. Inoculations are set to begin in the coming weeks with health workers, soldiers and police officers. Indonesia has recorded nearly 840,000 coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. It hopes to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating roughly two-thirds of the population in just over a year. Indonesia has ordered vaccines from several companies, but plans to rely mostly on Sinovac, which has already delivered three million doses.", "", "Separately, the Philippines said on Monday that it had secured 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, with the first 50,000 doses set to arrive by February. The Philippine Department of Health has been accused of botching an earlier opportunity to secure 10 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as early as this month. And in the Seychelles, an archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean about 1,000 miles east of Kenya, the government said in a statement released on Sunday that the country\u2019s vaccination campaign had begun with President Wavel Ramkalawan, who received the Sinopharm vaccine. The United Arab Emirates, which last month became the first country to authorize a Chinese coronavirus vaccine, has donated 50,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine to the Seychelles, the statement said, while India has offered 100,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. According to the Ministry of Health, the Seychelles has recorded 531 coronavirus cases and one death. Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.

David 'Dee' Delgado/Reuters Across New York State, medical providers had the same story in recent weeks: They had been forced to throw out precious vaccine doses because of difficulties finding patients who precisely matched the state\u2019s strict vaccination guidelines \u2014 and the steep penalties they would face had they made a mistake. On Saturday, state health officials responded to the outcry over discarded vaccines by again abruptly loosening guidelines as coronavirus cases continued to rise. Now, medical providers can administer the vaccine to any employees who interact with the public if there are extra doses in a vial and no one from \u201cthe priority population can come in before the doses expire,\u201d the new guidelines read. A pharmacy\u2019s \u201cstore clerks, cashiers, stock workers and delivery staff\u201d could qualify, the guidelines said. It was the second time in two days that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration had loosened the restrictions around who can get vaccinated in New York State. The governor announced on Friday that medical providers could vaccinate a wider range of essential workers and New Yorkers 75 years and older starting as early as Monday. The new, more forgiving guidelines highlight the difficulties the state has had in balancing the need to vaccinate vulnerable populations quickly with the imperative to prevent fraud and favoritism in the distribution process. Neil Calman, whose Institute for Family Health had to discard unused vaccine doses, hailed the rule change, but argued for yet more loosening of guidelines to allow for vaccinations of at-risk patients with conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease who are younger than 75. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing them in our office, and it just seems like we\u2019re turning them away today just so we can call them back in a week and say, \u2018Now you can get your vaccine,\u2019\u201d Dr. Calman said.", "Russia considers altering its vaccine dosage to inoculate more people. A medical worker preparing a dose of the Sputnik V vaccine in Moscow last month. Credit... Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press Russian vaccine scientists on Monday began a study to determine whether they can hasten the country\u2019s campaign of coronavirus inoculations by providing only a single dose of its normally two-dose vaccine. The idea, also under consideration in Britain and other countries, is that a single dose could provide more than half of the protection offered by a two-dose vaccine. While each vaccinated person would be less protected than if they had undergone the full inoculation cycle, the approach could potentially save more lives in the population as a whole. Russia\u2019s vaccine, called Sputnik V, uses two types of genetically modified human adenoviruses, which are common cold viruses. The new approach would administer only a single type of the cold virus in one shot, the group that developed the vaccine, the Gamaleya Research Institute, said on Monday. The institute, part of the Russian Ministry of Health, will study the single-dose approach, called Sputnik Light, in 150 volunteers in Moscow and St. Petersburg. It was not clear when it hoped for results or when Russia might decide whether to switch tack to a single-dose strategy. The institute\u2019s director, Aleksandr Gintsburg, said in December that the single shot was likely to prove about 85 percent effective but would vary for different categories of patients. The two-shot regime showed an efficacy rate of 91.4 in clinical trials. President Vladimir V. Putin suggested the new tactic in December. In the United States, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to end the practice of reserving the second shots of two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for those who have received a first shot. His administration would instead distribute nearly all available vials immediately. But Biden officials do not intend to forgo the second shot; vaccine production, they have said, is expected to ramp up to meet demand for second shots. The Food and Drug Administration has recommended against tweaking the dosage schedules, which have been carefully studied in clinical trials.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "world ROUNDUP Ice festival in China goes forward amid the country\u2019s worst outbreak in months. The Harbin Ice and Snow Festival normally draws millions of visitors each year. Credit... Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images China is experiencing its worst coronavirus flare-up in months, but that hasn\u2019t stopped an ice and snow festival from going ahead as planned in the northeastern city of Harbin. The annual festival, which is the largest of its kind in the world and normally draws millions of visitors, features colossal snow and ice structures that are elaborately carved over weeks by hundreds of workers and illuminated by colored LED lights. Last year, the festival shut down early after the central government imposed a strict lockdown on millions of people in Hubei Province, the central region where the coronavirus is believed to have originated. Harbin, a city of 10 million people near the Russian border, experienced its own outbreak last spring. Though life in most parts of China has largely returned to normal, a recent outbreak in the northern province of Hebei has led the government to impose a stay-at-home order on more than 17 million people in two cities there. On Monday, officials reported 85 new locally transmitted infections, mostly in Hebei. That announcement came one year to the day after Chinese state media reported the first known death from the coronavirus in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province. Since then, the virus has claimed the lives of more than 1.9 million people worldwide, according to a New York Times database. China\u2019s official death toll is 4,634. The winter festival in Harbin, which opened last month, is a popular destination during the Lunar New Year holiday, China\u2019s busiest travel period. With the country\u2019s borders closed to foreign tourists, most visitors this year are coming from around China. All visitors are required to show a \u201chealth code\u201d on a contact-tracing app and have their temperatures measured before entering venues. Several events and performances that would have encouraged crowds have been canceled. China also said on Monday that a team of investigators from the World Health Organization would be arriving on Thursday to begin an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. Last week, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., took the rare step of publicly criticizing China for blocking the team from entering the country even though some members were already in transit. The details of the W.H.O. team\u2019s visit have not yet been announced. In other developments around the world: The health care system in Britain is facing \u201cthe worst weeks of this pandemic,\u201d the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof. Chris Witty, said on Monday, adding that hospitalizations in England had already far surpassed the spring\u2019s peak. \u201cThis is an appalling situation,\u201d Professor Witty told the BBC, warning that the impact of the vaccines would not be felt for several weeks.
