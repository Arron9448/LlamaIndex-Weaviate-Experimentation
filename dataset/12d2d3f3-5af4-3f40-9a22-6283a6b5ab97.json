I can\u2019t emphasise that enough.\u201d", "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said the NHS was facing its \u201cmost dangerous\u201d point.", "He said: \u201cIn London for example one in 30 people currently have this coronavirus, across the country as a whole, it\u2019s one in 50. So this is a serious problem, and it\u2019s rising in every part of England.\u201d", "He added: \u201cThis new variant is really pushing things in a way that the old variant, which was already very bad, was not able to. So we have a very significant problem \u2026 The next few weeks are going to be the worst weeks of this pandemic in terms of numbers into the NHS.\u201d", "Whitty\u2019s comments came as seven new mass vaccination centres opened across England: in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Bristol, Epsom and Stevenage. He said it would be \u201cseveral weeks\u201d before vaccinations against the virus started to take effect.", "\u201cWe are now very close to the point with vaccination that we\u2019re going to be able to get on top of this, but it\u2019s not yet. If we want the numbers not to go up still further, everybody has to minimise the number of unnecessary contacts they have in their day.\u201d", "Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily, they will have Covid.\u201d", "Asked about the idea of extending mask rules to outdoors, Whitty said that while there \u201cmight be some logic\u201d for mask use in certain outdoor settings such as packed queues, by far the bigger issue was indoor proximity. However, on BBC Breakfast he refused to answer viewers questions about whether more restrictions were necessary. \u201cThe decisions about exactly what restrictions are in place are very much a matter for ministers,\u201d he said.", "But he urged the public to do their bit now. He said: \u201cThis is everybody\u2019s problem, any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person \u2026 This is the most important thing. Tinkering with the rules may be useful, but the far more important thing is that everybody abides by the spirit of the rules that are there at the moment. Everybody knows what they need to do.\u201d", "He added: \u201cWhat we need to do before the vaccines have had their effect, because it\u2019s going to take several weeks before that happens, is we need to really double down.\u201d", "Meanwhile, the minister for vaccine deployment, Nadhim Zahawi, said people should not sit down when going out to exercise. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: \u201cSo of course, exercise \u2026 But don\u2019t go out and sit or have that opportunity of social interaction because you\u2019re helping the virus and that\u2019s what we want to avoid.\u201d", "And pressed on whether the current restrictions were enough, Zahawi told Today: \u201cI am worried about supermarkets and people actually wearing masks and following the one-way system, and making sure when it\u2019s at capacity they wait outside the supermarket. I\u2019m worried about some of the pictures I\u2019ve seen of social interactions in parks, if you have to exercise you can go out for exercise only.\u201d", "Whitty was also asked by a viewer whether he was given a new slide clicker for Christmas to avoid having to request slide changes at Downing Street coronavirus briefings.", "The chief medical officer revealed he shared their frustration. \u201cI\u2019m with them on this one,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m rather hoping someone has sent one to Downing Street. I think they said they had, but Downing Street has not passed it on to me.\u201d", ""], "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Peter Walker"], "keywords": ["rules", "pandemic", "weeks", "prepare", "unnecessary", "need", "public", "worst", "told", "england", "restrictions", "going", "exercise", "street", "covid", "problem"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
