Her parents were both 16 when she was born, in 1992. Gomez grew up in a neighborhood that was mainly Mexican-\u200bAmerican, like her dad\u2019s family. (Her mother, Mandy Teefey, who managed Gomez\u2019s career until 2014, identifies as white.) She was named after Selena Quintanilla, whose music both her parents loved. Her mom let her splash around in the yard during rainstorms; her dad liked to watch Friday and Bad Boys with his cherubic baby girl. \u201cIt always smelled like fresh-cut grass,\u201d Gomez remembers of her childhood in Texas. \u201cWe\u2019d play outside for hours, and my nana and her friends would be sitting with their iced tea. It wasn\u2019t a lot, but it was great.\u201d", "As a kid, Gomez was sensitive but fearless: A picture of her comforting another kid on the first day of pre-K made the local paper. (\u201cApparently I had just been like, \u2018Peace!\u2019 to my mom and walked right in,\u201d she tells me.) She staged concerts in the living room and loved frilling herself up to compete in that particular Southern ritual\u2014the beauty pageant. Gomez\u2019s parents broke up when she was five, and Teefey mustered all her wherewithal to provide for her kid, working simultaneously at a Starbucks, a Dave & Buster\u2019s, and a Podunk modeling agency. She ably shielded Gomez from the ever-present financial difficulties. \u201cI remember always being reminded that people had less than we did,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t have much. But I felt like we did because my mom was always doing a hundred million things just to make me happy, and we volunteered at soup kitchens on Thanksgiving; we went through my closet for Goodwill.\u201d", "\u201cI haven\u2019t even touched the surface of what I want to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the moment when a director can see that I\u2019m capable of doing something that no one\u2019s ever seen\u201d", "When she was 10, she was cast, alongside Demi Lovato, on Barney & Friends, which was conveniently shot in another Dallas suburb. The job didn\u2019t feel like work: \u201cYou\u2019re on set with a big purple dinosaur and dancing and having a great time,\u201d she says, laughing. Three years after she wrapped her run on the show, she secured the role of Alex Russo on the Disney Channel show Wizards of Waverly Place and moved to Los Angeles with her mom. Gomez\u2019s desire to oblige and enchant, inherent in any young performer, became enshrined as a mandate. Working for Disney turned Gomez\u2019s life into a perpetual promotion, with her image quickly distributed through TV, music, movies, merchandise, live appearances, and cross-\u00adpromotion of all of the above. \u201cThat was my job in a way\u2014to be perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re considered a figure kids look up to, and they take that seriously there.\u201d Gomez\u2019s Wizards character was sly and sardonic, lazy about both school and wizardry\u2014that was the concept, by the way: a family of wizards running a West Village sandwich shop. But Alexandra Margarita Russo still radiated the essential Disney-girl quality: a spunky, unselfconscious precocity and confidence.", "It became part of Gomez\u2019s job to maintain that aura even as, simultaneously, the tabloid media began treating her as an object of interest. She was 15 when paparazzi began showing up on set. Her onscreen brothers, David Henrie and Jake Austin, felt protective of her. \u201cWe were all new to this, and they wanted to say things to the paparazzi, but you can\u2019t, because that\u2019s exactly what the paparazzi want,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cI remember going to the beach with some family members who were visiting, and we saw, far away, grown men with cameras\u2014taking pictures of a 15-year-old in her swimsuit. That is a violating feeling.\u201d", "I ask Gomez whether she was aware of how invasive this situation was as it was happening, or if she brushed it off in the moment. \u201cI think I spent so many years just trying to say the right thing to people for the sake of keeping myself sane,\u201d she says. By dint of her personality, as well as the fact that she was a young woman in the spotlight, she had to be unconditionally grateful, composed, sparkling. \u201cI\u2019m just such a people-pleaser,\u201d she adds."], "authors": ["Jia Tolentino", "Jia Tolentin", "Nadine Ijewer", "Gabriella Karefa-Johnso"], "keywords": ["mom", "faith", "kid", "career", "gomez", "parents", "job", "family", "politics", "youre", "selena", "music", "gomezs", "making", "paparazzi", "wizards"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
