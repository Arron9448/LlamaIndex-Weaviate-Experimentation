Rose, who is thirty-two years old, has been a member of Congress for nine months. In 2018, he won New York City\u2019s corner of Trump country\u2014a district Trump claimed in 2016 by nearly ten points\u2014after running a campaign that made more of his time in the Army than of his membership in the Democratic Party. More recently, he had been among the Party\u2019s more vocal holdouts on impeachment. In early September, when the House Judiciary Committee was voting to define the rules of its impeachment inquiry, Rose published an op-ed in the Staten Island Advance titled \u201cWhy I oppose Trump impeachment.\u201d In the days after the Ukraine scandal became public, Rose issued statements about how \u201call options must be on the table,\u201d but he still resisted supporting impeachment proceedings. Several Republicans had already lined up for a chance to take him on in 2020, including Nicole Malliotakis, a New York State assemblywoman, and a YouTube star known on the Internet as Joey Salads. Increasingly, Rose was in that lonely place for a politician: neither on one side nor the other.", "The stated subject of a town hall that Rose hosted in his district on Wednesday night was transportation, but that\u2019s not why the Bernikow Jewish Community Center was crawling with national press. There was the possibility of fireworks\u2014that Rose would continue to dance around the issue, while his constituents gave him hell from both sides. But, instead, the opposite happened. The questions from constituents were exclusively about transportation\u2014ferries, express buses, H.O.V. lanes\u2014and Rose dispatched with the impeachment matter in his opening remarks. \u201cI know when the majority of you look at the television, you just want to scream,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, we have Democrats who, before having sworn the oath of office, are saying that we should impeach the President of the United States. On the other side, though, we have Republicans who swore the same oath to the Constitution that I did. But suddenly they\u2019ve become deaf, mute, blind whenever allegations against the President are brought up. That\u2019s an even greater threat to our democracy.\u201d He went on, \u201cThe American people have a right to know if their President used the power of his or her office to get a foreign power to interfere in our elections.\u201d That\u2019s why, he said, he would support the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe President of the United States may be willing to violate the Constitution to get re\u00eblected,\u201d he added. \u201cI will not.\u201d Rose got a standing ovation. A man in the audience called out, \u201cDid you support Christopher Steele?\u201d He was shouted down.", "Afterward, Rose, who is short, with a shaved bald head and the square body of a former college wrestler, explained his decision to me over Bud Lights at a nearby bar. I asked him about his reaction to the summary of Trump\u2019s call with the President of Ukraine, in which Trump asked his counterpart to investigate the former Vice-President Joe Biden, and to the whistle-blower complaint that brought the call and the events surrounding it to the attention of Congress. \u201cThere was a true, incredible weight that I felt on my shoulders,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis is something that very rarely happens in this country. And it\u2019s not only sad but, shit, I got to take it slow.\u201d Generally, Rose said, he likes to be assertive, to act fast. But that wasn\u2019t his reaction in this case. \u201cI was all the things that I\u2019m often not\u2014I was nuanced, and I kept options open,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the thing that I really want to impress upon you is that I think that is important to my constituents\u2014that they know that I didn\u2019t jump to any conclusion.\u201d", "He hadn\u2019t been comfortable, he said, supporting an inquiry before he saw the call summary and the complaint. I asked him about the seven freshman Democrats who had signed a Washington Post op-ed last week, explaining why they were leaving the holdout ranks to join those calling for an inquiry\u2014they had all spent time in the military or the intelligence community, and, like Rose, had run for Congress partly on the strength of those backgrounds. Rose described the group\u2014which includes Gil Cisneros, of California; Jason Crow, of Colorado; Chrissy Houlahan, of Pennsylvania; Mikie Sherrill, of New Jersey; Elissa Slotkin, of Michigan; and Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, of Virginia\u2014as \u201csome of my best friends.\u201d He had spoken to them as the op-ed was being prepared, but opted not to join them. \u201cI chose to not take part in something like that before seeing the whistle-blower report or the transcript,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would never discredit them for what they did. They\u2019re real heroes.\u201d", "I asked him why Ukraine was the Trump scandal that justified impeachment. What about children being ripped from parents at the border? Or Trump telling Administration officials that they\u2019d be pardoned if they got in trouble for doing something he wanted? \u201cIt is clear that this Administration has done things that are horrific in nature\u2014horrific,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tear at the moral fibre of this country, tear at your own soul when you see them. There is a question of whether some of those things you just brought up are impeachable or not. What I see here is an issue that is clear, is clearly encapsulated, directly involves the President of the United States, represents a grave national-security threat, is backed up by a credible allegation.\u201d Still, Rose insisted, the most important thing to him was that, as he and his colleagues proceeded, they bring the rest of the country along with them. \u201cThis process has got to be one around not just fact-finding but trust-building,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to think about: How do we show the American people that this is a fair, just, nonpartisan effort? Bringing chicken to a testimony clearly cannot be part of this\u201d\u2014a reference to Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee, who brought a bucket of K.F.C. to a Judiciary Committee hearing with William Barr, in May. \u201cSelling \u2018Impeach the Motherfucker\u2019 T-shirts,\u201d Rose went on, \u201ccannot be a part of this.\u201d", "Rose\u2019s political identity might be described as \u201ca pox on both their houses.\u201d He often speaks of voters\u2019 frustration with the partisan warfare in Washington. Now he was stepping into the biggest political fight in Washington in a generation, and he was searching for the words to describe it. \u201cThis is as fucking serious as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have got to show the American people\u2014not just do it, but show the American people\u2014that that\u2019s the way we\u2019re treating this.\u201d", "Several times, I asked Rose if he thought he\u2019d risked his seat with this decision. He said he would just have to see. \u201cI think what I\u2019ve demonstrated tonight is that I\u2019m willing to do what\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, in my district, I think that people will respect the decision that I made.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "2058d8e3-2f05-38c4-afe4-08018073919c", "keywords": ["president", "think", "holdout", "rose", "impeachment", "asked", "american", "brought", "trump", "max", "ended", "representative", "thats", "inquiry"], "title": "Why Representative Max Rose Ended His Holdout on the Trump Impeachment Inquiry", "summary": "As of Wednesday morning, Max Rose, a congressman from Staten Island, was among the few remaining congressional Democrats\u2014less than a dozen\u2014not to support publicly an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.\nIn early September, when the House Judiciary Committee was voting to define the rules of its impeachment inquiry, Rose published an op-ed in the Staten Island Advance titled \u201cWhy I oppose Trump impeachment.\u201d In the days after the Ukraine scandal became public, Rose issued statements about how \u201call options must be on the table,\u201d but he still resisted supporting impeachment proceedings.\nIncreasingly, Rose was in that lonely place for a politician: neither on one side nor the other.\nThere was the possibility of fireworks\u2014that Rose would continue to dance around the issue, while his constituents gave him hell from both sides.\nThey\u2019re real heroes.\u201dI asked him why Ukraine was the Trump scandal that justified impeachment.", "authors": ["Eric Lach", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Benjamin Wallace-Wells", "John Cassidy"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
