Oulipo set out to formally explore the use of mathematical and other rules \u2013 known as \u201cconstraints\u201d \u2013 in the writing of literature.", "Its approach was two-pronged. First, what Oulipo called \u201canoulipism\u201d, discovering constraints used by writers from other ages and cultures, wittily referred to as \u201cplagiarism by anticipation\u201d: they seized on reversible poems in 3rd-century China and acrostics concealed in the Psalms, as well the bifurcating narratives in Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s 1941 \u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths\u201d. Second, \u201csynthoulipism\u201d, the invention and demonstration of new constraints for any writer who wished to use them.", "The first consciously Oulipian literary work was Queneau\u2019s Cent Mille Milliards de po\u00e8mes (A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems) of 1961, a book of 10 sonnets with each line printed on a separate strip. Since all 10 share the same rhyme scheme and rhyme sounds, each line can be replaced by the homologous line in any other sonnet, giving an astonishing one hundred thousand billion (10\u2071\u2074) variations. This is a truly potential work of literature: no one could read the entire collection in a lifetime.", "In the 'prisoner\u2019s constraint', letters with ascenders or descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, y) can't be used", "Oulipians including Italo Calvino, Georges Perec and Harry Mathews went on to produce some of the most extraordinary and compelling literature of the 20th century. Calvino\u2019s dazzling 1973 novel The Castle of Crossed Destinies (published before he was co-opted into the group in 1974) was inspired by two spreads of the Tarot, which he called \u201ca machine for constructing stories\u201d. Perec\u2019s 1969 La Disparition is an avant-garde detective novel written entirely without the letter E. In Oulipian terms it is a \u201clipogram in E\u201d, where moreover the missing letter is the crux of the novel (as Philip Terry notes, \u201cthe missing \u2018e\u2019 is a homophone for \u2018eux\u2019, those who disappeared in the Holocaust\u201d). When La Disparition was translated into English by Gilbert Adair in 1995 as A Void, Adair honoured Perec\u2019s central constraint throughout.", "Mathews\u2019s \u201c35 Variations on a Theme from Shakespeare\u201d functions as an Oulipo sampler in which he demonstrates constraints by applying them, one after another, to Hamlet\u2019s most famous soliloquy. So \u201cTo beckon or not beckon: that is the quinsy\u201d is \u201cTransposition W+7\u201d, ie replacing a word with the seventh subsequent dictionary entry; \u201cNothing and something: this was an answer\u201d is \u201cAntonymy\u201d; and \u201cTwo-beer naughty beet shatters equation\u201d is \u201cHomophony\u201d. All of these, and more wonders by all three authors, are sampled in The Penguin Book of Oulipo, a superb selection of 100 Oulipian texts published on the eve of the group\u2019s 60th anniversary.", "As well as writings by the group itself, Terry\u2019s survey includes the work of so-called \u201canticipatory plagiarists\u201d: Jonathan Swift\u2019s writing machine in Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Lewis Carroll\u2019s experiments with scale in Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, and the painting machine from the \u201cClinamen\u201d chapter of Alfred Jarry\u2019s Exploits and Opinions of Dr Faustroll, Pataphysician. The name of the chapter the last appeared in, \u201cClinamen\u201d, became the Oulipian term for an allowable deviation from the strict application of a constraint that can only be used if it is not needed. Avoiding disappearing down a rabbit hole of his own, Terry briefly sketches but doesn\u2019t go too deeply into the historical connections between Oulipo and the Coll\u00e8ge de \u2019Pataphysique, nor too far into the proliferation of official and unoffocial \u201cOu-X-Po\u201d groups in other fields and genres such as Oulipopo, the study of crime fiction; the extra \u201cpo\u201d from policier.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Georges Perec\u2019s Life, a User\u2019s Manual uses chess moves and other constraints to depict every room in a large Parisian apartment building.\u2019 Photograph: Louis Monier/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images", "Illustrating the group\u2019s legacy and the principle that these constraints are available to anyone, Terry also includes examples of writings \u201cafter Oulipo\u201d. There\u2019s an extract from Richard Beard\u2019s arch Donald Barthelme-esque 2011 novel Lazarus Is Dead, the chapters of which shrink then grow again as Lazarus is reborn (schematically reminiscent, in its symmetry, of \u201canticipatory plagiarist\u201d George Herbert\u2019s 1633 calligram \u201cEaster Wings\u201d). We also find Alice Oswald, whose poignant and beautiful Memorial removes most of the Iliad, to leave only accounts of the deaths of 200 soldiers. which she garlands with choruses drawn from Homer\u2019s extended similes: \u201cLike leaves/Sometimes they light their green flames/And are fed by the earth/And sometimes it snuffs them out.\u201d", "So what\u2019s in it for the reader? Lovers of puzzles and word games will relish the many sometimes deceptively simple constraints, such as the \u201csnowball\u201d, in which each successive line is one unit (a letter, syllable or word) longer, or the \u201cprisoner\u2019s constraint\u201d, in which letters with ascenders or descenders (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t and y) cannot be used. For Mathews, though, interviewed in the Paris Review, \u201cWhat distinguishes Oulipo from other language games, is that its methods have to be capable of producing valid literary results.\u201d", "There\u2019s a debate about whether Oulipian authors need be open about the constraints they\u2019re using. Jacques Jouet is pro-transparency \u2013 the \u201cscaffold\u201d is part of the substance of the work. Calvino and Mathews preferred that the reader detect hidden patterns without necessarily knowing what they are; Calvino initially forbade publication of the algorithm behind his most famous novel, If on a Winter\u2019s Night a Traveller. Terry takes Calvino and Mathews\u2019s lead, so as you read through The Penguin Book of Oulipo the writing stands on its own. I\u2019m with Jouet, and like to have ready access to further information. I found the index of constraints challenging and occasionally mystifying, since in trying to discover which were employed in a particular text, one must use it in reverse.", "Some Oulipian works far transcend whatever constraints produced them. Perec\u2019s masterpiece, Life, a User\u2019s Manual, uses chess moves and various constraints to depict every room in a large Parisian apartment building, and the myriad stories, texts, objects and lives they contain. Even in excerpt, it is a multilayered and supercharged reading experience. When it first appeared in David Bellos\u2019s masterly English translation in 1987, the UK publisher included no mention whatsoever of Oulipo: readers apprehended that something out of the ordinary was afoot, but could grasp only fleeting impressions, enhanced by the typographic games and acrostics captured or created in English.", "In their provocative 2013 book The End of Oulipo?, Lauren Elkin and Veronica Esposito suggest that Oulipo today can\u2019t help but be overshadowed by its illustrious former members; that \u201cthe dynamism \u2026 has flagged\u201d, and the group is now more concerned with self-promotion, resulting in a kind of Oulipo-lite. Anxieties about live performance \u2013 that Oulipians risk \u201cbecoming \u2018seasoned performers\u2019, working on their stage presence\u201d \u2013 feel like a page v stage straw man. But Elkin also robustly dismantles what she calls the \u201cfrustratingly macho\u201d output of Oulipo\u2019s current president, Herv\u00e9 Le Tellier.", "Top 10 experimental thrillers Read more", "And the real discovery in The Penguin Book of Oulipo are the works by women. Of particular interest is the British author Christine Brooke-Rose (1923\u20132012), whose virtuosic, typographically volatile 1998 novel Next is an Oulipo-inspired policier set among the homeless, and written without using the verb \u201cto have\u201d. Juliana Spahr of feminist offshoot Foulipo \u201cslenderises\u201d (removes parts of) the text of anti-abortion legislation to produce the oppositional poem, \u201cHR 4881 is a Joke\u201d.", "The biggest surprise is Anne Garr\u00e9ta, whose novel Sphinx, first published in 1986, explores DJ culture, gender and sexual politics in Parisian nightclubs. The two main characters are the narrator and their lover A***, the sex or gender of neither of whom is given. Sphinx (available in Emma Ramadan\u2019s 2015 English translation) is ahead of its time, a radical bridge between Kathy Acker, the \u201cchemical generation\u201d authors of the 90s, and emerging innovators such as this year\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-nominated Isabel Waidner.", "The Penguin Book of Oulipo already feels indispensable. It\u2019s also a welcome celebration of the contribution of literary translators, including Bellos, Gilbert Adair and William Weaver, to the popularising of this initially reclusive group. Terry\u2019s anthology connects us to a wider world of Oulipian wordplay, and beyond. Perhaps that\u2019s the point. After all, as Calvino reminds us in The Castle of Crossed Destinies, there are certain fountains that \u201conce you drink from them, increase your thirst instead of slaking it\u201d.", "\u2022 The Penguin Book of Oulipo: Queneau, Perec, Calvino and the Adventure of Form, edited by Philip Terry, is published by Penguin (RRP \u00a325).
