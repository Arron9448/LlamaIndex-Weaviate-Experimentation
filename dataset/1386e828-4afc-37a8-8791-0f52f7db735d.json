Opinion polls and pot-banging protests suggest growing public anger at the Trump-admiring politician who was elected in 2018 after Rousseff\u2019s mentor, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was jailed and prevented from running by a judge who later joined Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet.", "Rousseff claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s sabotaging of containment and vaccination efforts, refusal to order a lockdown and failure to offer adequate economic support to the poor had contributed to a tragedy of \u201ccatastrophic proportions\u201d.", "\u201cI\u2019m not saying Brazil wouldn\u2019t have suffered deaths [with a different response] \u2013 all countries did,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saying that part of the level of deaths here is fundamentally down to incorrect political decisions, which are still being taken.\u201d", "Brazil\u2019s breakdown was also an international threat. \u201cThe absence of an effective fight against the pandemic [in Brazil] leads to something extremely serious: the emergence of the so-called new variants, which are highly infectious and have increased the number of deaths in neighbouring countries,\u201d Rousseff said, pointing to how South American neighbours were closing their borders for fear of the more contagious P1 variant linked to Brazil\u2019s Amazon.", "Many critics now argue Bolsonaro\u2019s actions amount to \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2013 and Rousseff said she was among them.", "\u201cI use that word. What characterizes the act of genocide is when you play a deliberate role in the death of a population on a massive scale,\u201d the 73-year-old said from her home in Porto Alegre, one of many cities where hospitals have been overwhelmed and doctors forced to play God.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not the word [genocide] that interests me \u2013 it\u2019s the concept.

She also blamed the economic elites, military chiefs, media moguls and politicians who helped the rightwing extremist win power by backing her removal from office and then cheering Lula\u2019s downfall and Bolsonaro\u2019s rise. World leaders including Donald Trump had also handled the pandemic disastrously.", "\u201cPeople will have to be held responsible for the catastrophe that has been engineered in Brazil,\u201d Rousseff said, charting its current tribulations back to her suspension from office exactly five years ago for allegedly manipulating the budget to mask economic malaise.", "\u201cBolsonaro is a product of this \u2026 original sin: the impeachment,\u201d she said of what her supporters call a politically \u2013 driven \u201ccoup\u201d.", "On Sunday 16 April 2016, Bolsonaro, then an obscure congressman, was one of 367 deputies who approved Rousseff\u2019s impeachment during an unruly session in which he dedicated his vote to a dictatorship-era torturer who oversaw the abuse of leftist rebels such as her.", "Back then, Rousseff said she had never imagined Bolsonaro would one day become president. Nor could she envisage Brazil facing today\u2019s emergency under more inadequate leadership. \u201cThe reality is worse than anything I could have possibly imagined.
