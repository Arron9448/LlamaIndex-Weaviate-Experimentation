Suddenly, you\u2019re aware\u2014painfully or pleasantly, depending on the subtlety of the maneuver\u2014that this character is a locomotive, moving inexorably along the track that is the script. One question in great dramas is how an individual\u2019s free will might chafe against the world\u2019s immovable fixtures. The actor\u2019s eye on the page offers a slightly dark answer: maybe our liberty is an illusion, and our lives, like a play or a piece of music, are churning toward an inevitable destination. The slang for actors who haven\u2019t yet learned all their lines is that they\u2019re still \u201con book.\u201d Perhaps that applies to all of us, just reading aloud and ambling toward our marks with some dim awareness of an ending.", "I kept thinking about that awful possibility while watching \u201cThe Work of Adrienne Kennedy: Inspiration and Influence,\u201d a digital \u201cfestival\u201d of filmed readings put on by Round House Theatre, in association with McCarter Theatre Center. Kennedy, who is eighty-nine, is one of our greatest and least definable living playwrights, restlessly inventive and ruthlessly unshy about the pressures exerted by history upon our lives. If one motif hums through her work (besides herself: she is our foremost artist of theatrical autobiography), it is a nagging, sometimes unbearable suspicion that the past has hijacked the present.", "Kennedy\u2019s most famous play, the surrealist one-act \u201cFunnyhouse of a Negro,\u201d from 1964, is a kind of dream masquerade. A woman called Negro-Sarah\u2014the specificity of a name smashed up against the bleak determinism of a category\u2014sits surrounded by a chorus of hyperverbal historical figures who are meant to act as alternate \u201cselves.\u201d One is a Habsburg duchess; one is the Congolese freedom fighter Patrice Lumumba; another is Jesus. Sarah wears a noose around her neck like a victim-in-waiting but talks like a member of a cosseted\u2014if a bit bugged-out\u2014bourgeoisie. She\u2019s \u201csoulless, educated and irreligious,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to possess no moral value, particularly value as to my being. I want not to be. I ask nothing except anonymity.\u201d Negro-Sarah would like to use her middle-classness as a talisman to ward off recognition and pain. She thinks of her white friends \u201cas an embankment to keep me from reflecting too much upon the fact that I am a Negro.\u201d And yet, irreversibly, that fact breaks the embankment like a flood. Because of the color of her skin and the history it holds, Sarah\u2014like her selves, whose monologues are haunted by mixed parentage\u2014signifies wildly, full of \u201cmoral value\u201d well beyond her own control.", "In \u201cFunnyhouse,\u201d with its gruesome contortions and mordant humor, Kennedy reminds me of the conceptual artist Adrian Piper, whose best gag might be the drawing \u201cSelf Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features.\u201d For both artists, realism falls apart under the absurdity of race and the unction of history. Between who you are and how you\u2019re seen lies a possibly unbridgeable gap.", "The plays that are presented in \u201cThe Work of Adrienne Kennedy\u201d come from later in the playwright\u2019s career, and show a development in her thinking. \u201cHe Brought Her Heart Back in a Box,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s most recent play, first produced in 2018, tells the story of a fraught romance between Kay (Maya Jackson), a Black woman of mixed ancestry, and Chris (Michael Sweeney Hammond), the white heir to a prominent family who rule the affairs of the Georgia town where they both were born and raised. The harrowing stakes of their courtship are clear from the start, but Kennedy\u2019s mode of narration\u2014a series of dreamy dispatches that never quite settle into dialogue\u2014shows just how misty this doomed matter of the heart really is.", "The Round House production, directed by Nichole A. Watson, doubles down on Kennedy\u2019s suspenseful gauziness. There are quick cuts to highly symbolic representations of the actors\u2019 words\u2014somebody\u2019s hand opens slowly to reveal, embedded on the palm, a series of graves\u2014and the lighting (designed by Sherrice Mogjani) is a spectral, insistent blue. I came away thinking that Kennedy\u2019s work is unusually well suited to filmic treatment: when her characters speak, they not only advance the plot but impart lush and unlikely images. A great filmmaker interested more in rhythm and the uncanny than in strict narrative\u2014someone like Garrett Bradley or Kahlil Joseph\u2014could make a Tarkovskian masterpiece after soaking in Kennedy\u2019s \u0153uvre.", "Still, despite the richness of the imagery, I kept thinking about the actors, who weren\u2019t so much acting as reading out loud. Every once in a while, they\u2019d steal a glance at the text, which made me think of them less as performers than as partakers in a closet play, trying to bring the show out into the living room, where the rest of us could hear. If the Kennedy of \u201cFunnyhouse\u201d was trying to find an identity, or a narrative, worth living out, she has, in later years, begun to acknowledge that somebody, somewhere, has already staked out a plan, like it or not. (The stage directions, read by Agyeiwaa Asante, give that sense a concrete voice.) Romantic choice is often a metaphor for the more drastic currents lurking elsewhere in our lives, eager to take us under.", "That feeling grows stronger in a pair of plays written in the nineties\u2014\u201cOhio State Murders\u201d and \u201cSleep Deprivation Chamber\u201d\u2014which feature Kennedy\u2019s alter ego, Suzanne Alexander. Suzanne, like Kennedy, is a celebrated playwright who travels to universities and gives talks about such topics as \u201cthe construction of a play with Aristotelian elements.\u201d In \u201cOhio State Murders,\u201d directed by Valerie Curtis-Newton, Suzanne (Lynda Grav\u00e1tt) tries to explain the source of the violent imagery in her plays. Her lecture\u2014confined to the page, a reminder of a lost feeling of freedom\u2014is, in Kennedy\u2019s hands, a roving monologue, which acts as a background for a story set in the past. The young Suzanne (Billie Krishawn) is a student at Ohio State University, infatuated with Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cTess of the d\u2019Urbervilles\u201d and, more problematically, her white English professor. Upward mobility, which Negro-Sarah hoped might earn her a pass from trouble, has introduced the young Suzanne to the beginning of an inevitable tragedy.", "\u201cSleep Deprivation Chamber,\u201d which Kennedy wrote in collaboration with her son Adam, and is directed here by Raymond O. Caldwell, tells the story of Suzanne\u2019s son, Teddy, who was accosted by police outside his own front door\u2014an eerie forecast of the incident involving the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and the Cambridge police, which was refereed by Barack Obama\u2014and badly beaten. Absurdly, it\u2019s Teddy (Deimoni Brewington) who stands accused of a crime. Again, Suzanne\u2019s literary activity provides a pretext for narration. Between flashbacks to the assault and scenes of a deposition, Suzanne writes letters to public officials who might be able to help her son.", "Suzanne seems to share\u2014if a bit more jadedly\u2014Negro-Sarah\u2019s ill-fated hope in Black exceptionalism. In her letters, Suzanne talks about her brother-in-law, a Stanford professor emeritus who has fallen into a race-induced depression, and her daughter, also a lecturer at Stanford, making sure to mention her own success. She describes the indignity done to her son as something that has been done to \u201cour son and our family.\u201d Teddy\u2019s father, livid, says that the police have \u201ctangled with the wrong family.\u201d \u201cWe are innocent,\u201d Suzanne says\u2014all of us. Even though, deep down, she knows that her family\u2019s well-earned prestige won\u2019t save Teddy, she can\u2019t help but interpret the incident as an affront to the entire edifice of the Black middle class. It was supposed to help!", "Instead, everybody\u2019s following a script. When, in a flashback, Rex Daugherty, who plays the police officer, looked down at his pages, it felt like a revelation, a belated admission that his tough-guy spiel is, indeed, just a spiel, a play out of some book, just as his later violence would turn out to be. Teddy\u2019s cries seem scripted, too. We all know them, and could even join in if the occasion ever arose. \u201cPlease let me up,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Vinson Cunningham", "Vinson Cunningha"], "keywords": ["actors", "work", "restlessly", "plays", "son", "white", "thinking", "kennedys", "inventive", "kennedy", "play", "suzanne", "adrienne"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
