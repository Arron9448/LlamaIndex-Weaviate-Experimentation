That gesture, as much as anything he said in his hour-long speech, signalled that he intends to swiftly help ordinary Argentines who are suffering from recession, high inflation and rising poverty. But some wondered, as the Peronist accepted the presidential sash and baton from Mauricio Macri, his centre-right predecessor, whether he would drive the country forwards or backwards.", "The question was provoked in part by the presence of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the new vice-president, who preceded Mr Macri as president. Ms Fern\u00e1ndez, a populist who governed from 2007 to 2015, created the economic mess whose clean-up Mr Macri botched. She has been indicted in nine separate court cases for acts of corruption and other misdeeds. In the new administration she has already amassed unprecedented influence for a vice-president. The new president (no relation to Ms Fern\u00e1ndez) wants to be a crowd-pleaser as she was, at least for poor Argentines, but without repeating her mistakes. That will be tricky.", "The \u201csocial catastrophe\u201d that Mr Fern\u00e1ndez promises to end is real. Two-fifths of Argentina\u2019s citizens cannot afford a monthly basket of staple goods. The year-on-year inflation rate exceeds 50%. Argentina\u2019s $57bn bail-out from the IMF is the largest in the fund\u2019s history. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez promises to put the economy \u201cback on its feet\u201d. But an adviser to the new president admits: \u201cThere are no easy answers on the economy, and no good options.\u201d", "Mr Macri\u2019s bet was that he could restore the confidence that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had battered, which would lead to growth. On taking office in 2015 he lifted exchange controls brought in by Ms Fern\u00e1ndez, reached an agreement with foreign creditors (with whom she had fought) and lowered her punishing taxes on exporters. That approach failed, largely because Mr Macri did not cut the budget deficit fast enough to keep investors calm when global interest rates rose. The peso slumped and inflation soared (see chart). The IMF agreement in 2018 was a second stab at reviving confidence. But the austerity it demanded hit just as Argentina\u2019s political season was getting under way, weakening the economy and driving voters to Mr Fern\u00e1ndez. That knocked the peso again.", "The new president\u2019s big idea is to reverse Mr Macri\u2019s sequence: growth will lead to a revival of confidence rather than the other way round, he argues. To boost growth, he intends to bring back tools employed by Ms Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s administration\u2014but to wield them more deftly.", "The centrepiece of the economic programme is likely to be a restructuring of Argentina\u2019s $105bn debt to foreign bondholders (which does not include debt to the IMF ). This is to be carried out by the new economy minister, Mart\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, an academic with little political experience who specialises in debt negotiation. He has proposed that Argentina defer payment of both interest and principal for the next two years. Analysts assume he will end up demanding bigger concessions from creditors. Bond prices suggest the markets are expecting an implicit haircut\u2014a discount on the bonds\u2019 face value\u2014of nearly 50%. \u201cEvery dollar we don\u2019t use for debt will go to consumer-led recovery at home,\u201d Mr Guzm\u00e1n has told his new colleagues.", "The idea of paying foreign creditors less than they are owed is bound to be popular. So, too, will be Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s plans to boost wages for public-sector and low-paid workers and raise pensions.", "Ideas for reining in inflation are unorthodox. The new government may keep a cap on utility prices that was due to expire at the end of 2019. It is expected to keep capital controls introduced by Mr Macri as an emergency measure to curb the depreciation of the peso, and to reach a pact with employers and trade unions to hold down prices and wages. (This may mean that salaries will rise by less than Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has implied.)", "The big question is whether such a package can exclude the growth-clobbering stuff that the Peronists campaigned against. That is unlikely. The new government does not want to draw down the remaining $11bn of its IMF loan, but will still have to deal with the fund. The IMF is likely to welcome a cut in the private-sector debt burden (making it easier for Argentina to repay the fund). Both sorts of creditor are likely to insist on a primary fiscal surplus, ie, before interest payments, which means more austerity than Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has in mind. There is worried speculation that the central bank will pay for promises such as higher pensions by printing money, even though its new president, Miguel Pesce, is thought to be a safe choice. If either fiscal or monetary policy is too loose, that will push up inflation in spite of the bodges being planned to contain it.", "Although Mr Fern\u00e1ndez is bringing back into use some of the techniques used by his Peronist predecessor, he is keen to signal that he will not repeat her excesses. \u201cThis is Alberto\u2019s economic team, and he will be in charge on this front,\u201d says an adviser. Yet the new president has not laid to rest fears that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez will have undue influence. Mr Guzm\u00e1n got the economy ministry after she vetoed two other candidates, says the presidential adviser.", "She had a hand in the choice of the ministers of interior, defence and security. Her supporters will be in charge of the agencies that handle taxation, pensions and care of old people, which have big budgets and jobs to offer political allies. Her clout in these areas suggests that reforming the state will not be a priority. As vice-president, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez is the senate\u2019s leader and commands the Peronist bloc in the chamber, where it has a majority. Her son, M\u00e1ximo, leads the Peronists in the lower house of congress.", "Ms Fern\u00e1ndez also helped arrange the appointment of Carlos Zannini, one of her closest associates, as attorney-general. Mr Zannini was held in preventive detention for his alleged role in covering up a deal that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had made with Iran to absolve it of blame for the bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires in 1994 in which 86 people, including the bomber, died. His trial has been delayed indefinitely. Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor who was murdered in 2015, had indicted Mr Zannini. As attorney-general Mr Zannini, who was released from jail in 2018 and denies all charges, will lead the government\u2019s anti-corruption unit and its team of lawyers.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has already made clear that he is not concerned about the alleged misdeeds of his senior officials. He contends that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez and jailed members of her government are victims of \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d. He has pronounced Mr Zannini innocent. \u201cWe vindicate you,\u201d he told the new attorney-general.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez will revive aspects of his Peronist predecessor\u2019s foreign policy. The incoming foreign minister, Felipe Sol\u00e1, has signalled \u201cre-engagement\u201d with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s leftist dictator, who will now be less of a regional pariah. Argentina\u2019s new government will not accept in its current form a trade deal negotiated by Mercosur, a four-country trade bloc, with the European Union. This will dampen Argentina\u2019s growth prospects in the long run and increase tension with Brazil, the bloc\u2019s biggest member. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez and Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s populist president, speak of having \u201cpragmatic relations\u201d. But there is no hiding the frostiness. Mr Bolsonaro did not attend Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s inauguration, sending his vice-president instead.", "The Macri government is proud of having ended the economic isolation that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez imposed on Argentina. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent four years taking Argentina out of the deep freeze,\u201d says Jorge Faurie, the outgoing foreign minister. \u201cThe fear is we\u2019re going back.\u201d Optimists think that the leftward shift in diplomacy will make it easier for Mr Fern\u00e1ndez to adopt a moderate economic policy. Argentines must hope so.\u25a0"], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["predicament", "fern\u00e1ndez", "economic", "plans", "foreign", "mr", "imf", "peronist", "ms", "cope", "zannini", "president", "argentinas", "alberto", "crisis", "inflation", "macri"], "id": "470e5bad-f655-3eb1-9f15-0dbf47110de3", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/12/12/how-alberto-fernandez-plans-to-cope-with-argentinas-economic-crisis"}
