The Star Tribune\u2019s goal was to reach 100,000 digital subscribers by the end of last year, and it hit that mark by May. And the paper just won a prestigious Polk Award for its coverage of the killing of George Floyd and the aftermath.", "\u201cThe communities that have papers owned by very wealthy people in general have fared much better because they stayed the course with large newsrooms,\u201d said Ken Doctor, on hiatus as a media industry analyst to work as C.E.O. and founder of Lookout Local, which is trying to revive the local news business in smaller markets, starting in Santa Cruz, Calif. Hedge funds, by contrast, have expected as much as 20 percent of revenue a year from their properties, which can often be achieved only by stripping papers of reporters and editors for short-term gain.", "Alden has made deep cuts at many of its MediaNews Group publications, including The Denver Post and The San Jose Mercury News. Alden argues that it is rescuing papers that might otherwise have gone out of business in the past two decades.", "And a billionaire buyer is far from a panacea for the industry\u2019s ills. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, go find yourself a rich guy. It\u2019s the right rich person. There are lots of people with lots of money. A lot of them shouldn\u2019t run newspaper companies,\u201d said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and the former editor of The Chicago Tribune. \u201cSam Zell is Exhibit A.
