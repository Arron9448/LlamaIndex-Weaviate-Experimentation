It\u2019s a time full of parlor games, black-tie dinners, and presents (of the joke variety) exchanged at teatime on the 24th. On Christmas Day, the whole family walks to St. Mary Magdalene Church as photographers snap pictures of them dressed in their holiday best.", "This year, however, the royal family will see their plans disrupted, like so many others. The U.K. government says that due to the pandemic, \u201cChristmas bubbles\u201d can consist of no more than three households. The Queen, who has four children and eight grandchildren (six of whom have families of their own), won\u2019t be able to host the extended Windsor clan in her hallowed halls.", "So that begs the question: How will they celebrate this festive season instead?", "Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen and Prince Philip are to have Christmas at Windsor Castle. \u201cHaving considered all the appropriate advice, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have decided that this year they will spend Christmas quietly in Windsor,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThe Queen and the duke are fortunate to spend Christmas with their family every year. They understand that their family will have competing demands over the Christmas period and are content to have a quiet festive season this year.\u201d That\u2019s not to say they will be totally alone; it\u2019s understood that some family members will stop by to say a socially distanced hello in late December.", "The Queen will also be delivering her annual Christmas message, which, going by her previous COVID-19 era addresses, should serve as a powerful and hopeful piece of rhetoric.", "As for Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall? They\u2019ll be at their country home of Highgrove House in Gloucester.", "The Cambridges haven\u2019t confirmed where they will spend Christmas yet because, well, it seems like they don\u2019t entirely know. During a visit to Wales last week, Prince William admitted they were \u201cstill trying to make plans.\u201d", "\"It's difficult to know what to do for the best,\" he told the crowd. However, a likely location for the family is their estate of Anmer Hall in Norfolk.", "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, meanwhile, are readying for their first holiday Stateside. A few days ago, they were spotted shopping for a tree for their Montecito, California home. And here\u2019s a funny tidbit: According to People, a small child accidentally asked Harry if he worked at the barn.", "It seems that just like everyone else, the royal family will have a low-key holiday across the board. But here\u2019s hoping that in 2021, the festive formalities at Sandringham return once again."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["queen", "windsor", "spending", "spend", "family", "holiday", "festive", "season", "royal", "prince", "christmas"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
