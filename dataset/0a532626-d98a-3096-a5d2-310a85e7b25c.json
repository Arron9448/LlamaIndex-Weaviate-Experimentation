An illuminated window high off the ground excites the gaze and plucks at the imagination. A panhandler enters a subway car, and every eye turns to the floor as smoothly as the slats of a venetian blind sliding shut. What\u2019s that determined non-noticing about? It\u2019s a personal barricade\u2014don\u2019t approach\u2014but also an instinctive attempt to preserve privacy, for the asker as well as for the asked. How can anyone break through that kind of willed blindness and be seen? Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about the performance required of the urban miserable. I mean \u201cperformance\u201d descriptively, not cynically. The situation calls for an actor\u2019s ingenuity: a well-managed entrance, an efficiency of motion, a monologue shaped and smoothed by repetition and timed to last from one subway stop to the next. Then it\u2019s out the door and into a new car with a new audience to try to win over.", "There is a New York City street door onstage in Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s rough-cut gem of a new play, \u201cHalfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven\u201d (at the Atlantic Theatre Company\u2019s Linda Gross), the kind that\u2019s not designed to attract attention\u2014scuffed glass backlit by ugly fluorescents, decorated with metal placards announcing that the premises are under twenty-four-hour surveillance and warning against loitering. You\u2019ve walked by it a thousand times and, if you\u2019re fortunate, have never had to go in. It\u2019s the entrance to Hope House, a government-funded halfway house for women on the Upper West Side, and, inside, a residents\u2019 meeting is wrapping up. (The set, with its perfectly calibrated atmosphere of institutional idiosyncrasy, is by Narelle Sissons.) Mr. Mobo (Neil Tyrone Pritchard), a Nigerian social worker with an unintentionally comical sense of propriety, is trying to get his charges to listen to various announcements: the incest survivors\u2019 group now meets in the basement; \u201cYou, Me, and Hepatitis C\u201d comes with a pancake breakfast. Good luck to him. The women, raucous and combustible, have their own agendas, and their own alliances based on a variable calculus of race, blood, and personal affinity.", "Queen Sugar (Benja Kay Thomas) and Munchies (Pernell Walker), black women who handle the hostile world by laughing in its face, sit together; Taina (Viviana Valeria), a twenty-something whose tough shell hides serious emotional wounds, never leaves the side of her mother, Happy Meal Sonia (Wilemina Olivia-Garcia), a baffled woman in the grip of mental illness. There are floaters, too: Rockaway Rosie (Elizabeth Canavan), a soft-faced white drunk who wants only to be liked; the teen-age Little Melba Diaz (Kara Young, an actor to watch), a straight-A student who\u2019s been through hell; Betty Woods (the startling Kristina Poe), a fleshy recluse who infuriates the others by refusing to bathe; and Wanda Wheels (Patrice Johnson Chevannes), an elegant, aloof former actress with an English accent and dark skin stretched taut over her fine-boned face. Wanda likes to station herself in her wheelchair on the sidewalk in front of the building, smoking with a cigarette holder like a silent-movie star and drinking vodka through a straw, as she talks about her glory days to Mateo (Sean Carvajal), the sweet seventeen-year-old son of a terminally ill resident, and works on purposefully starving herself to death.", "The alpha of this pack of underdogs is Sarge (the astounding Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas), a short, pugilistic butch in combat boots, her hair pulled back in a lacquered bun, who carries herself like a pit bull, leading with the chest. Once deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, she comes by her nickname honestly, and even has a picture with Obama to prove it. How she fell on hard times since then is left to our imagination, though it doesn\u2019t take much to fill in the sketch. Sarge is an alcoholic who\u2019s long stayed sober, but she doesn\u2019t have her fury under equivalent control. Now she\u2019s dangerously in love, with Bella (Andrea Syglowski), Hope House\u2019s newest arrival, a former stripper who has an infant son and is trying to kick heroin\u2014thirty-one days clean, she says. (Specificity will break your heart every time.) Bella, who calls Sarge Carmen\u2014she\u2019s seen the gentler, private person underneath the bravado\u2014is attracted but wary. She knows Sarge\u2019s type, controlling and proud. She has reason to be concerned. Sarge is in constant need of a target for her boiling rage, and she settles on Bella\u2019s friend Venus Ramirez (Esteban Andres Cruz), a trans woman. Sarge\u2019s declaration of war is a masterpiece of garbled contemporary logic:", "You\u2019re a selfish cocksucker is what you are. I know your type: can\u2019t make it in a men\u2019s shelter cuz they\u2019ll rape your ass, so you take advantage of some bullshit PC government loophole and fuck over all the REAL FEMALE VICTIMS who are desperate for a safe fuckin\u2019 space!", "Like much of Guirgis\u2019s dialogue, this is a laugh line and a gasp line rolled into one. Guirgis, whose last play, \u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2015, is a wizard at getting language to flow hot, funny, and fast, and the superb ensemble\u2014beautifully handled by John Ortiz, the artistic director of the LAByrinth Theatre Company, which co-produced the show\u2014matches his skill. In this world of broken women, words can be both weapon and salve. Two of the play\u2019s best moments are structured around verbal performances, one by Melba, a burgeoning poet, and the other by Betty, whose preferred genre is best left a surprise. And one of its tensest, saddest lows is a confrontation between Munchies and Joey Fresco (Victor Almanzar), the building\u2019s janitor, who gets caught in the crosshairs of her despair. As Munchies rants, hilariously\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll call you what the fuck I want, bitch ass bald headed bitch! You ain\u2019t no real janitor! You don\u2019t know the first thing about sanitationalism!\u201d\u2014we see Joey struggling not to let language ignite into action. He\u2019s on parole; how would he be able to explain to a judge that a woman\u2019s tongue cut him so deeply that he had no choice but to retaliate physically? Then, there\u2019s one of the play\u2019s recurring menaces, a frightening, whiny drunk (Greg Keller), who is looking for his wife and to whom I wasn\u2019t inclined to give much sympathy until I saw, in the script, that he had a name\u2014Nicky\u2014and a description: \u201cHe beat up his wife. His dad did worse to him.\u201d Guirgis gives him not an excuse but an explanation\u2014the best he\u2019ll ever have.", "It\u2019s natural that Guirgis, a lifelong New Yorker and a properly profane bard of the city, should be focussed on the subject of displacement. In \u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy,\u201d the contested battleground was a rent-controlled apartment. Here, it is Hope House itself, whose future, in this wealthy neighborhood, is precarious at best. Fighting on its behalf are Father Miguel (David Anzuelo), a priest with a complicated past, and Miss Rivera (Elizabeth Rodriguez, in yet another of the play\u2019s standout performances), the organization\u2019s exhausted, no-nonsense director. She and Mr. Mobo are constantly reminding the residents to be aware of their well-heeled neighbors, the ones with the power. Don\u2019t smoke outside: the neighbors will complain. Don\u2019t drag around that cart of empty bottles: the neighbors will notice. \u201cNeighbors\u201d is a bitter term for vigilante observers like these. We never see them; most likely, we are them, though it\u2019s to Guirgis\u2019s credit that he doesn\u2019t over-moralize that point. The final scene of the play, in which Miss Rivera and Sarge face each other one last time, is rich with belated revelation and barbed empathy. With extraordinary physical artistry, using only the set of her shoulders and her eyes, Col\u00f3n-Zayas transforms from a woman we have come to know, fear, and care for into an anonymous person we have seen a million times but never really seen: the rover, without hope or a home, forever on her way to somewhere else. \u2666"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/stephen-adly-guirgis-world-of-broken-women", "id": "0a532626-d98a-3096-a5d2-310a85e7b25c", "title": "Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s World of Broken Women", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Alexandra Schwartz", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino", "Vinson Cunningham"], "summary": "It\u2019s the entrance to Hope House, a government-funded halfway house for women on the Upper West Side, and, inside, a residents\u2019 meeting is wrapping up.\nBella, who calls Sarge Carmen\u2014she\u2019s seen the gentler, private person underneath the bravado\u2014is attracted but wary.\nIn this world of broken women, words can be both weapon and salve.\nTwo of the play\u2019s best moments are structured around verbal performances, one by Melba, a burgeoning poet, and the other by Betty, whose preferred genre is best left a surprise.\nWe never see them; most likely, we are them, though it\u2019s to Guirgis\u2019s credit that he doesn\u2019t over-moralize that point.", "pubDate": null}
