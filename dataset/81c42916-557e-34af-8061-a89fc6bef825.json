And it was in Coleman Playground, a stretch of concrete near the waterfront populated with ledges and grind rails, that she felt familiarity amid the unknowns of her new city.", "\"I grew up going to parks, and surrounded by these people,\" Berm\u00fadez said over video. \"And I felt safer there.\"", "She was particularly intrigued by the number of women and non-binary skaters testing tricks and sharing laughs. Since watching Bing Liu's \"Minding the Gap,\" a 2018 documentary about male friendships strengthened by skateboarding, Berm\u00fadez had been interested in the skate culture and identity among those who don't identify as male.", "Skateboarder Sarah Seafoss at LES Coleman Playground skate park in Manhattan, New York.
