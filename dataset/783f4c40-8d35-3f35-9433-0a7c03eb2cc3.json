But they were clear on who their favourite is.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Director Fernando Meirelles, and Jonathan Pryce as Pope Francis, during the filming of \u2018The Two Popes\u2019. Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP", "\u201cI would not have come all this way for Benedict,\u201d said Marisol Dur\u00e1n Vergora, a first-time visitor to the Vatican from Spain. \u201cHe is an extremist, whereas Francis is more human and closer to the people.\u201d Another pilgrim, who wished to remain anonymous, speculated after being briefed on the goings-on: \u201cBenedict decided to abdicate and should keep his promise of staying silent.\u201d", "The ex-pontiff, who chose to be called Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI after his abdication in 2013, instead of reverting to Joseph Ratzinger, is at the centre of a drama that has been more entertaining than the Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes. It started with a book written with the outspoken conservative cardinal Robert Sarah defending priestly celibacy. That in itself would not have caused a stir. But the timing of the book\u2019s release, as Pope Francis considers allowing the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon in order to overcome a shortage of priests, led many to accuse Benedict, who still lives within the walls of Vatican City and continues to wear a white cassock, of breaching his vow of silence and undermining his successor\u2019s authority.", "In a bizarre twist, after extracts of From the Depths of Our Hearts were published in France\u2019s Le Figaro newspaper last Sunday, the former pontiff demanded that his name be dropped as co-author. His personal secretary, Georg G\u00e4nswein, said that while Benedict knew that Cardinal Sarah, who has clashed with Pope Francis in the past, was preparing a book, and had sent him an essay on the priesthood, he had not approved a co-authored project and had neither seen nor authorised the book\u2019s cover.", "Sarah denied allegations that he had misled Benedict, providing proof of the text that had been given to him and claiming that Benedict was aware that the project would take the form of a book.", "The French publisher, Fayard, went ahead and published the book as planned, but in future editions Benedict will be named as a contributor rather than co-author. Meanwhile, the US publisher, Ignatius, refused to relent, saying in a statement that the English version would retain Benedict as co-author.", "Amid the fallout over the book, Vatican commentators picked over its origins, with some saying \u201cthe two popes\u201d were the victims of exploitation by the warring conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic church. Throughout his life Benedict has been a prolific writer, but others questioned his capacity to construct such a detailed essay at the age of 92. A Vatican journalist for the rightwing Italian press claimed that it was a furious Pope Francis who ordered that Benedict\u2019s name be removed.", "Benedict has come forward on a variety of issues over the past seven years, most controversially writing last year that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201chomosexual cliques\u201d among priests were to blame for the church\u2019s paedophile-priest scandals. The opinion came two months after an unprecedented Vatican summit on tackling clerical sexual abuse, and sharply contrasted with that of Francis, who blamed the scandals on a clerical culture that elevates priests above the laity. Benedict also wrote a letter complimenting Cardinal Joachim Meisner \u2013 a fierce critic of Francis who spoke out against the pontiff allowing remarried divorcees to receive holy communion \u2013 who died in 2017.", "But this is the first time he has intervened, whether knowingly or not, in a matter that the Pope is actively considering. Francis is weeks away from publishing his decision on the Amazon after a document approved by bishops at a synod in October noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. If Francis supports the request to ordain married men, it would apply only to those already serving as deacons. The pontiff himself has consistently said that he would never change the centuries-old requirement for celibacy, but critics fear that the Amazon could set a precedent.", "\u201cIn all the times that Benedict has intervened, what he has written is coherent with what he thinks, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist and author of the book Tango Vaticano. La Chiesa al Tempo di Francesco (\u2018Vatican Tango. The Church in the Time of Francis\u2019). \u201cThey say he may have been manipulated by his entourage, but he was the one who chose his entourage.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Gorgeous Georg\u2019 G\u00e4nswein at the start of the Palm Sunday Mass at Saint Peter\u2019s Square in the Vatican.

We\u2019re in this situation because he did not keep his promise to be quiet.\u201d", "The Two Popes is a fictionalised depiction of a bromance between Benedict and Francis despite their different ideas, with, in the final scene of the film, the pair eating pizza and drinking beer as they watch Germany play Argentina in the World Cup final. In real life, it is unlikely the two are so chummy, but most experts agree that the relationship, at least until now, has been cordial, with Francis acting graciously in the face of opposition.", "\u201cThey have always tried to have good relations in order not to present a great split at the top of the church,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican journalist and author of Joseph Ratzinger, Crisis of a Papacy. \u201cBut this is the first time the retired pope has [explicitly] taken sides, and this is really serious.\u201d", "Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Benedict\u2019s comments on celibacy could scupper the potential move in the Amazon and leave many questions unanswered, especially over how the role of Pope Emeritus would continue.", "Among those in the queue for a papal audience was Alex Flood, a protestant minister from the US who was in Rome to do research on Catholicism. \u201cI know very little about the politics of the Catholic church but from our perspective, celibacy should be a choice and not beholden to tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I speak to Catholics they recognise this, but it\u2019s such an old tradition that the change is uncomfortable.\u201d", "Flood described the scandal over the book as a \u201cdog-and-pony show that is missing the needs of people\u201d.", "\u201cIt\u2019s akin to watching American politics,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "keywords": ["catholic", "book", "pope", "benedict", "popes", "fallout", "francis", "plotting", "church", "cardinals", "g\u00e4nswein", "vatican", "explosive", "celibacy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
