The museum was a \"weapon\" -- as integral to imperial domination as the Maxim gun, he writes --- that was used to \"legitimize, extend and naturalize new extremes of violence within corporate colonialism.\"", "Exhibitions reduced cultures to trophies in glass cases in order \"to tell the story of the victory of Europeans over Africans,\" he said in a phone interview. They were used \"to inspire colonial administrators and soldiers ... who fought these wars and thought they were doing so in the name of civilization.\"", "The bronzes were feted as masterpieces but they were presented as the work of inferiors.

(The Kingdom of Benin is located in what is now the southern Nigerian state of Edo.)", "Drawing on accounts from soldiers and British officials, the author dismantles myths to tell a story of brutality and greed. Officially, the \"punitive expedition\" of 1897 was a response to an attack on a convoy led by Captain James Phillips, consul-general of the Niger Coast Protectorate, a month earlier. Phillips and several of his men were killed by Bini troops while on a mission to, ostensibly, lobby the king of Benin over access to the valuable palm oil and rubber in his territory.", "But documents from Protectorate leaders show plans for a punitive expedition were discussed as early as 1892. Phillips himself had written to Prime Minister Lord Salisbury requesting weapons for an invasion of Benin to ease the flow of commerce. In this light, Hicks argues the mission was designed to provide a pretext for attack. He also shows that such a large British force, which he estimates at around 5,000 men with 10 warships and 38 Maxim guns, could not have been assembled in the month between expeditions.", "A meeting between Benin chiefs and Vice-Consul Henry Galway of the Niger Coast Protectorate in 1892.

But Hicks disputes their supposed heroism. Accounts from military leaders describe indiscriminate slaughter from a safe distance, while warships destroyed towns and villages along their route. Eight British deaths were reported to the Houses of Parliament but no effort was made to tally Bini losses, despite inquiries from ministers.", "The loss of heritage was also incalculable. The earthworks of Benin were once an archeological marvel comprising a 16,000-kilometer network of walls that formed one of the world's largest man-made structures. They were -- along with palaces, homes and religious sites -- reduced to rubble.", "British officials and museums downplayed the destruction and claimed damage was accidental. This is contradicted by the systematic approach Hicks reveals in soldiers' diaries. \"Work to be done Saturday February 20th,\" wrote Captain Egerton, chief of staff for the expedition. \"Walls and houses to be knocked down. Queen Mother's house to be burnt.\"", "Officially, looted artifacts were sold to pay the expedition costs.

France has thus far authorized the return of just 27 pieces to Benin and Senegal. European museums have offered loans rather than permanent returns, while Nigeria's government has resorted to buying Benin Bronzes at a premium from auctions.", "Hicks blames intransigence from museums. \"As a sector, our leadership has tried to sweat this one out,\" he said, while his book invites readers to help break the impasse by joining the movement for restitution.", "The Quai Branly Museum in Paris holds the largest collection of African heritage artifacts in France.

In 2003, the British Museum's director made a case against returns on the basis that artifacts should be \"housed in safety, conserved, curated, researched, exhibited and made available to the widest possible public.\"", "The British have also previously resisted requests to loan bronzes to Nigeria, claiming the pieces were too fragile to travel. Concerns have been raised about the standard of facilities to house the bronzes -- although the British Museum has recently helped secure funding for a new museum in Benin City, Nigeria.", "Hicks notes that bronzes preserved for centuries at Benin's royal court have only been lost, neglected or destroyed since arriving in London.
