See, we can make a deal together!\u201d he wrote. The swap was a rare moment of d\u00e9tente following months of escalating hostilities, which came within minutes of a military confrontation in June, after Iran shot down a sophisticated U.S. drone.", "It ended the traumatic saga of Xiyue Wang, an American student in the fourth year of a ten-year prison sentence in Iran on two charges of espionage. He had been arrested, in 2016, while doing doctoral research in Tehran\u2019s national archives on the nineteenth and early twentieth century Qajar dynasty. The swap also ended the controversial case of Masoud Soleimani, an Iranian stem-cell researcher who was arrested when he landed in the United States, in October, 2018, en route to a visiting-scholar position at the Mayo Clinic. He had been charged with trying to export proteins used to culture cells for medical research without a U.S. license, a minor form of sanctions-busting.", "Both men had been caught up in the decades of tension\u2014played out in human lives\u2014between Washington and Tehran. Both were widely seen as pawns. A senior Trump Administration official told reporters that he hoped Wang\u2019s release was \u201ca sign that the Iranians are realizing that their practice of hostage-taking diplomacy really should come to an end.\u201d Six other Americans are still detained in the Islamic Republic, including Robert Levinson, who disappeared inside the country twelve years ago. The Trump Administration has arrested at least thirteen Iranians in the U.S. in just the past two years.", "Trump took credit for the release, with thanks to the Swiss government, which has represented U.S. interests with Iran ever since Washington severed ties with Tehran, in 1980. Yet other interlocutors claim that the Administration usurped the narrative after almost three years of lethargic diplomacy. They claim that they initiated the negotiations and did much of the legwork\u2014often despite resistance and roadblocks imposed by Trump\u2019s current and former envoys, according to U.S. and Iranian sources.", "In Zurich, Wang was turned over to Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran. The State Department tweeted a picture of the two on the tarmac in front of a blue-and-white Air Force plane. But Hook had been among those most resistant to dealing with Iran, according to multiple sources close to the negotiations. He has engaged only in recent weeks, after a swap appeared likely to happen with or without him, sources told me. Two days before the swap, Hook called on \u201call nations to stand with the Iranian people\u201d and \u201cdiplomatically isolate the regime.\u201d A leading hawk on Iran, Hook has also recently been under investigation by the State Department\u2019s inspector general for discrimination against an Iranian-American employee.", "Winning the release of Americans imprisoned abroad is among the toughest and messiest challenges that the United States faces. It usually involves myriad players and interests, often outside the U.S. government\u2014as was the case in the latest swap with Iran. Frustrated that the Administration was getting nowhere, Jason Poblete, the lawyer for the Wang family, said that he had reached out to the former Kansas congressman Jim Slattery. For years, Slattery had engaged with Iranians in a multidenominational Abrahamic dialogue; he had also travelled to Iran and knew the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and Iran\u2019s U.N. Ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who graduated from the University of Kansas. \u201cSlattery and I were exploring many possible options to help Mr. Wang, including humanitarian pathways that should always be open, especially when relations between nations are difficult. These pathways can be useful for securing the release of Americans,\u201d Poblete told me. They worked behind the scenes for several months with U.S. and Iranian parties and family members. \u201cIt was extremely complicated,\u201d Poblete said. \u201cWe took our work to the Administration. It found a way to make it happen.\u201d", "The former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson said that he also invested twenty months in negotiating with Iran behind the scenes. \u201cI dispute the Administration\u2019s version, because we negotiated the deal,\u201d Richardson told me this weekend. He met with senior U.S. officials\u2014from the White House, State Department, and Justice Department\u2014and Iranian diplomats and Soleimani\u2019s defense lawyers. A former congressman, governor, and Cabinet secretary, Richardson has negotiated prisoner cases with North Korea, Sudan, Colombia, Cuba, Iraq, Bolivia, Peru, and Bangladesh.", "The turning point came in April, when Zarif publicly signalled interest in a swap. \u201cExchange them. All these people that are in prison inside the United States, on an extradition request from the United States\u2014we believe their charges are phony,\u201d he said during a speech at the Asia Society, in New York. \u201cThe United States believes charges against these people in Iran are phony. Fine, let\u2019s not discuss that. Let\u2019s have an exchange. I\u2019m ready to do it. And I have the authority to do it.\u201d", "Richardson worked with Zarif on details when they met, in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, he said. Slattery was part of that channel, too. As the first step in the process, they settled on the exchange of Wang and Soleimani. The first breakthrough coincided with a change within the Trump Administration following the departure of John Bolton, another hawk on Iran, from the National Security Council, in September. He was replaced by Robert O\u2019Brien, the former State Department hostage negotiator. Among hostage families, O\u2019Brien has been credited with generating more interest at the White House since he took over at the N.S.C. Richardson worked closely with O\u2019Brien, he told me.", "Richardson, Slattery, and Poblete expected the exchange to unfold next week. In a plea deal that Slattery worked on with Soleimani\u2019s lawyers, the Iranian scientist was due in an Atlanta court on December 11th, when he was expected to plead guilty, be sentenced to time served, and then be deported within days. After the judge\u2019s ruling, Iran would release Wang to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran; the Swiss would then put him on a plane to Qatar. Richardson met with the Iranian U.N. Ambassador on December 4th to confirm the final details.", "One of the trickiest aspects of the exchange was Soleimani\u2019s legal status. The Justice Department wanted to follow through with his case but not appear to be subverting the U.S. judicial system in order to free an Iranian who had broken a law in exchange for an American wrongly jailed by Iran. The exchange negotiated by Richardson, Slattery, and Poblete was delayed while the Department of Justice \u201cdid due diligence,\u201d Richardson said. The Justice Department did not want to be engaged in a prisoner swap that would set a dangerous precedent for the remaining hostages\u2014and the future. The plea deal was the way around it.", "In a surprise move, however, the Justice Department instead dropped all charges against Soleimani, the Administration official said on Saturday. He did not provide details. \u201cWe feel that, given where Mr. Soleimani\u2019s case was headed, the fact that we were able to use Iran\u2019s interests in having him come home to spur the negotiations that led to the return of Mr. Wang\u2014we view that as a very, very good deal for the United States,\u201d he said. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Slattery said that top White House officials abruptly approved the dropping of all charges against Soleimani. \u201cJust within the last three days, there were directions from the highest levels of our government to blow by the plea deal and drop all charges,\u201d he said.", "Even Soleimani\u2019s lawyer, Lenny Franco, does not know why the charges were dropped. \u201cIf you can figure it out, let me know,\u201d he told me on Sunday. He received a \u201cfrantic\u201d call on Thursday morning from his office, informing him that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Atlanta had said a prisoner exchange was in the works. The judge agreed to dismiss charges without prejudice, but the decision would not go into effect until U.S. marshals delivered Soleimani to Zurich for the swap on Saturday. \u201cWhenever you get charges dismissed as a defense attorney, you don\u2019t ask why,\u201d Franco told me. But, in forty-three years practicing law, he added, he\u2019d never had a case that ended like this one.", "Richardson, Slattery, and Poblete all said that the Administration did not inform them of the exchange\u2014or of the change in the plans that they had negotiated. Richardson and Slattery found out only when the news broke on Saturday, and Poblete by accident. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t cost much for them to acknowledge that this was done with our help,\u201d Mickey Bergman, the vice-president of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, told me. \u201cThey had insisted that we were delusional and wanted to call it off because they didn\u2019t believe us.\u201d Richardson added, \u201cTypically, the Trump Administration does not like to share credit, but this is a happy outcome, so we shouldn\u2019t fight over getting credit.\u201d", "The White House dismissed Richardson\u2019s initiative. \u201cWhile we appreciate Ambassador Richardson\u2019s efforts, this release was negotiated by current U.S. officials with Swiss assistance,\u201d a senior U.S. official told me. The Administration also rejected Zarif\u2019s overture as propaganda. \u201cWe never believed that those public comments of Mr. Zarif were very serious,\u201d the Administration official told reporters. \u201cThe proper way to deal with these sorts of negotiations was through established diplomatic channels, either in talks directly with the United States or going through our protecting power, the Swiss,\u201d he said. Zarif flew to Zurich to pick up Soleimani. He tweeted a picture of the two on his plane flying back to Tehran.", "On Saturday afternoon, Trump called the exchange \u201ca great thing for Iran.\u201d He told reporters, \u201cI think it was great to show that we can do something. It might have been a precursor as to what can be done.\u201d The Administration official said he was hopeful that Wang\u2019s release was a sign that Iran is \u201cwilling to come to the table\u201d to negotiate other flash points, including its nuclear program, missile tests, and role in other Middle Eastern countries. Both the United States and Iran have sought engagement, even as their differences have deepened.", "Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, said that the exchange was a reason for optimism, although it is only one step in dealing with forty years of hostage dramas and tensions with Iran. \u201cIt\u2019d be wrong to overestimate the possibilities that the exchange could create, but it\u2019d also be wrong to underestimate its promise,\u201d Vaez told me. \u201cIt constitutes a very positive step, because it\u2019s the first time under the Trump Administration that Iran and the U.S. have agreed on anything.\u201d", "This piece has been updated to include comments by Lenny Franco."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-real-deal-behind-the-us-iran-prisoner-swap", "id": "6c7af731-3b07-3e73-aaed-ec338a6a539c", "title": "The Real Deal Behind the U.S.\u2013Iran Prisoner Swap", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Robin Wright", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino", "Masha Gessen"], "summary": "He has engaged only in recent weeks, after a swap appeared likely to happen with or without him, sources told me.\nIt usually involves myriad players and interests, often outside the U.S. government\u2014as was the case in the latest swap with Iran.\n\u201cI dispute the Administration\u2019s version, because we negotiated the deal,\u201d Richardson told me this weekend.\nThe exchange negotiated by Richardson, Slattery, and Poblete was delayed while the Department of Justice \u201cdid due diligence,\u201d Richardson said.\nThe Justice Department did not want to be engaged in a prisoner swap that would set a dangerous precedent for the remaining hostages\u2014and the future.", "pubDate": null}
