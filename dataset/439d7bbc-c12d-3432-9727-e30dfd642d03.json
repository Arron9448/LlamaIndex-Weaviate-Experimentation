The church had been her polling place in the past, but when she tried to sign in her name was not on the registry. Mason, a forty-four-year-old African-American mother of three, was then given a provisional ballot. If her credentials checked out, the polling-place volunteer said, her vote would be counted. Instead, a few months later, Mason was arrested for voting illegally. After a one-day trial, a judge sentenced her to five years in the state penitentiary. Mason appealed. But, before she could get a ruling on her appeal, a federal judge ordered her back to federal prison for an additional ten months. Her state arrest, the judge ruled, was a violation of the terms of her initial release. \u201cThey could have put me on home confinement,\u201d Mason told me. \u201cBut they were so adamant to send me back to prison. They were so adamant for me to lose my job.\u201d", "Mason was released from federal prison for a second time, this past September, and is now waiting for the Texas Court of Appeals to decide whether the illegal-voting conviction will stand. Even if it does not, Mason will continue to be the face of voter suppression in the United States. Her home state of Texas has been called \u201cground zero for voter suppression,\u201d not only for its severe prosecution of Mason but for the grotesque attempt by the former secretary of state David Whitley to purge from the election rolls nearly a hundred thousand voters who he claimed were not citizens. This was a fiction, but it took a court order, in February, to stop the state from harassing voters. In the meantime, President Trump used those made-up numbers to warn his seventy million Twitter followers that the hundred thousand voters in Texas were \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d He urged his audience to support \u201cStrong voter ID!\u201d", "Restrictive voter-I.D. laws are part of a concerted Republican effort to limit the franchise by peeling off constituencies that might vote them out of office, especially people of color and students. Since 2010, twenty-five states have made it harder for Americans to vote. These efforts accelerated after the Supreme Court ruling in Shelby v. Holder, in 2013, which struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act. Just last week, a judge in Wisconsin approved the removal of nearly a quarter million \u201cinactive\u201d voters. This week, Georgia purged more than three hundred thousand registered voters. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, fifteen states have enacted strict voter-I.D. requirements, twelve have made it more difficult for people to register to vote or to stay registered, ten have curtailed early or absentee voting, and three have made it harder for ex-offenders to reclaim the right to vote. A woman in North Carolina is currently facing nineteen months in prison for voting in the 2016 Presidential election while on probation. In Florida, where, in 2018, voters overwhelmingly chose to restore the franchise to former felons, the state legislature has passed laws to curtail the initiative. As it stands, only sixteen states and the District of Columbia automatically restore voting rights upon one\u2019s release from prison. (It\u2019s estimated that eight per cent of the American population, and thirty-three per cent of African-American men, have a felony conviction.)", "It is likely that Mason\u2019s name had been struck from the voter rolls because she had been incarcerated. Once Mason finished serving her five-year sentence for tax fraud, she was put on what is called \u201cfederal supervised release,\u201d a set of re\u00ebntry requirements for ex-felons coming out of a federal prison. Texas prohibits felons on parole, probation, or what it calls \u201csupervision\u201d from voting. But, as Tommy Buser-Clancy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas who is working on Mason\u2019s appeal, told me, \u201cIndividuals under federal supervised release have completed the entire term of their incarceration.\u201d Parole, probation, and community supervision, on the other hand, are continuations of an initial sentence. \u201cThe mere fact that the two terms\u201c\u2014supervision and federal supervised release\u2014\u201cuse somewhat similar language does not provide a basis for criminal liability,\u201d Buser-Clancy and his colleagues wrote in their appellate brief. \u201cIn the correct context, the meaning of each is entirely different.\u201d That is to say, Mason\u2019s future may come down to the legal interpretation of a single word.", "When Mason got out of prison in 2016, no one informed her that being on federal supervised release rendered her ineligible to vote. \u201cThe whole time I was at the halfway house, we had to take re\u00ebntry classes,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, no one gave us the information that we couldn\u2019t vote. . . . They only started telling people that in 2019. It\u2019s almost like they were setting us up to fail. \u201d", "Mason is now driving a twenty-six-foot box truck\u2014\u201cGod has blessed me with a job,\u201d she said\u2014and has been able to hold on to her house. But her son had to drop out of college, forgoing a football scholarship, when Mason was sent back to prison. \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard on my family,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially now, because I may have to go back to prison again. But I\u2019m not going to say that I regret my situation, because it has educated me and it has educated my family and it has educated a lot of people. What I want right now is for the situation to be corrected. Nobody goes to the polls with their I.D., in their neighborhood, to vote, to go back to prison. Nobody goes to do their civic duty to go back to prison. I didn\u2019t go to try to do any kind of scam. I did what I felt like I had the right to do. And I still feel like I have that right.\u201d", "That right is the essence of citizenship in a democracy. When, in 2002, Congress included a provisional-ballot requirement to the Help America Vote Act, it was to insure that Americans like Mason, who show up at their polling place and find that they are not on the rolls, may still have the opportunity to exercise it. In her case, and in keeping with the law, once election officials determined that she was ineligible to vote (having, perhaps, conflated federal supervised release with state supervision), her ballot was thrown out. The paradox, as her lawyers have pointed out, is that Mason was charged with voting illegally even though she did not actually vote. The State of Texas, on the other hand, claims that Mason\u2019s intent to vote is equivalent to her having voted. If the three-judge appeals panel agrees, then Mason\u2019s case will undermine the provisional-ballot provision, establishing the precedent that a rejected provisional ballot can lead to a criminal conviction.", "\u201cThe whole point of provisional ballots is to create a system where people aren\u2019t afraid to cast a ballot when there is ambiguity about their eligibility,\u201d Buser-Clancy said. \u201cThe idea is that the state just determines their eligibility on the back end. But, if you can all of a sudden prosecute people who think they\u2019re eligible but turn out not to be, then you\u2019ve gutted the provisional-ballot system, and you make voting a whole lot scarier.\u201d", "Mason told me that, if she dwells on the upcoming appeals-court decision, which has not yet been scheduled, she\u2019ll go crazy. \u201cSo I am trusting in God,\u201d she said. \u201cMy faith is very strong.\u201d Even before she began her ten-month federal sentence, she has been going door to door, telling her story to anyone who will listen, urging them to register to vote. \u201cMy goal is to go out there to black and brown neighborhoods and tell them, \u2018Hey, we need you to sign up. I might not be able to vote, but you can vote for me.\u2019 \u201d"]}
