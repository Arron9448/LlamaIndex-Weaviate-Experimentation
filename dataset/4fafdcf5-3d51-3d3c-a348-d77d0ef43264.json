The fact that we have it in one.\u2026\u201d Walensky shakes her head in wonder.", "\u201cYay for science,\u201d the nurse says.", "\u201cYay for science,\u201d Walensky agrees.", "After vaccination, patients are monitored for an allergic reaction for 15 minutes, so Walensky\u2014who had been chief of infectious diseases at Mass General until a few weeks ago\u2014takes a seat in a makeshift clinic set up in the now-shuttered museum of medicine at the hospital. \u201cIt has been so hard,\u201d she says, dabbing her eyes over her mask. \u201cSo much of what we do as doctors has to do with touch. With COVID all you can see are the eyes, and these patients have been so alone, without their families.\u201d It is not the first time she\u2019s become emotional over the toll of this pandemic. When she spoke recently at the announcement of her new job as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she also teared up. \u201cMy kids were like, \u2018You quivered.\u2019\u201d She laughs at herself. \u201cI did! I can\u2019t help it. I want to be strong, but when you look at all the people affected and the collateral damage, it\u2019s heavy.\u201d", "There\u2019s no doubt that Walensky, 51, has the scientific and intellectual chops for her new job. Besides her now-former position at Mass General, the teaching hospital of Harvard, she is a prolific author of papers on the epidemiology of HIV and, at 43, was among the youngest women ever promoted to full professor at Harvard Medical School. As Julie Gerberding, M.D.\u2014who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009\u2014says, \u201cHer credentials and reputation are impeccable. It\u2019s clear that the Biden administration played an ace in this decision.\u201d It\u2019s also clear Walensky will bring much-needed compassion to a nation reeling from the trauma of the last year. \u201cShe\u2019s an interesting choice,\u201d says Ingrid Bassett, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who counts Walensky as one of her mentors. \u201cIt shows that they understand the messenger is just as important as the message. She\u2019s warm, she\u2019s kind, you feel she wants to make the world a better place. People are ready to feel that sense of trust in the messenger.\u201d", "The CDC was founded in 1946 to combat malaria in the South, which is why the main campus is located in Atlanta. In the years since, it has evolved into a revered institution entrusted with protecting the country\u2019s health. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t roll off the public\u2019s tongue,\u201d Walensky says, \u201cbut I rely on it for everything I do. If you type c in my Google search bar, the first thing that comes up is the CDC website.\u201d For all those reasons, its missteps in this pandemic year have been acutely painful for the scientific community. First the CDC stumbled by producing a flawed COVID-19 test early on. More recently, whistleblowers have revealed the extent to which politics have interfered with the agency\u2019s delivery of medical advice. Health memos from the CDC were being edited by the likes of Kellyanne Conway and Ivanka Trump. Lifesaving practical advice was simply ignored\u2014when the agency sought to issue a nationwide requirement that masks be worn on all public transportation last September, the White House blocked it without discussion."], "authors": ["Rebecca Johnson", "Rebecca Johnso"], "keywords": ["dr", "cdc", "harvard", "medical", "scientific", "science", "school", "politics", "shes", "saving", "hospital", "walensky", "general", "rochelle"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
