A neighborhood volunteer group, the Riverside Oval Association, stores gardening paraphernalia inside it, but sometime after the park was created, a little more than a century ago, the octagon enclosed a fountain, which was designed to feature a statue of a cherub and a mermaid, called \u201cMusic of the Waters.\u201d", "The sculptor\u2019s model for the mermaid was Audrey Munson. In the early nineteen-hundreds, Munson posed for so many sculptors, painters, and photographers in the city that she was called Miss Manhattan and Venus of Washington Square. She was born in Rochester in 1891. Her parents divorced when she was eight, and she and her mother eventually moved to Manhattan. When she was still a teen-ager, the sculptor Isidore Konti asked if she would be willing to pose \u201cin the altogether\u201d for a large piece he was working on, for the grand ballroom of the Hotel Astor. Both Audrey and her mother, who was present, were appalled by his request, but Konti assured them that, as an artist, his motivation was above reproach. \u201cTo us it makes no difference if our model is draped or clothed in furs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only see the work we are doing.\u201d The Munsons ultimately agreed, mostly because they needed money. The sculpture was called \u201cThree Graces,\u201d and Audrey was all three. She later called that piece\u2014which now exists only in photographs\u2014\u201ca souvenir to my mother\u2019s consent.\u201d", "James Bone, a former New York bureau chief for the Times of London, wrote a book about Munson, titled \u201cThe Curse of Beauty,\u201d in 2016. \u201cSet like gemstones in her milky skin, she had questioning, slightly impertinent gray-blue eyes,\u201d he wrote. She had a gulp-inducing figure and was unusually good at finding the perfect pose and holding it for hours. She was also a student of the artists who studied her. \u201cFrom the temperamental painter, who is a great man one day and a naughty child the next, to the earnest, analytical sculptor, who is a cynic about women even while he idealizes them, the model learns art from all its perspectives,\u201d she wrote in a newspaper column.", "A shocking number of men, not all of them artists, found Munson literally irresistible. There were tragic romances, marriage proposals from strangers, and the inevitable Harvey Weinstein moments. In 1919, Walter Wilkins\u2014a sixty-five-year-old physician and the owner of a house, on West Sixty-fifth Street, in which Munson and her mother had recently been tenants\u2014beat his wife to death with a machinist\u2019s hammer, possibly in the hope that Munson would then be willing to marry him. He was sentenced to death but hanged himself in his cell before he could be executed.", "Munson probably never had a romantic relationship with Wilkins, but her fortunes dwindled in the scandal that accompanied the trial. She\u2019d always been underpaid, and now, she and her mother believed, Hollywood producers, who\u2019d promised that she could star in a movie of her life, had cheated her out of a fortune. By 1921, they were living on a small farm near Mexico, New York, and peddling kitchen utensils door to door. A year later, Munson attempted suicide by swallowing mercury bichloride. In 1931, when she was thirty-nine, her mother had her committed to St. Lawrence State Hospital, in Ogdensburg, for what was called incurable \u201cmental blight.\u201d Hardly anyone visited her. She died there in 1996, at the age of a hundred and four.", "Munson once said that her image appeared in more than forty pieces in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum. That\u2019s probably an exaggeration, but her face or figure can still be seen in at least a dozen public works in the city, among them the pediment above the entrance to the Frick Collection, on East Seventieth Street; the memorial to Isidor and Ida Straus, who died on the Titanic, at 106th and Broadway; the Pulitzer Fountain, across from the entrance to the Plaza Hotel; and the Maine Monument, at Columbus Circle, in which all the female figures are her.", "The Riverside Oval Association held its biannual It\u2019s My Park Day earlier this year, during which a dozen neighbors raked, planted, watered, and mulched. There used to be water in the park, to feed the fountain, but the plumbing deteriorated decades ago. Bruce Robertson, a member of the association, said, \u201cWe hook up a hose to a fire hydrant across the street, and, while that works, it\u2019s less than ideal.\u201d The city has approved a plan to run new pipes, but, Robertson said, \u201cthe money is still sitting in the Parks Department.\u201d Even once the water has been connected, though, there will be no mermaid: at some point, Munson\u2019s statue disappeared. \u2666"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/audrey-munson-the-venus-of-washington-square", "id": "7d506a0d-408d-3b2d-91f9-22dfa9f7380d", "title": "Audrey Munson, the Venus of Washington Square", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["David Owen", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "In the early nineteen-hundreds, Munson posed for so many sculptors, painters, and photographers in the city that she was called Miss Manhattan and Venus of Washington Square.\nBoth Audrey and her mother, who was present, were appalled by his request, but Konti assured them that, as an artist, his motivation was above reproach.\nMunson probably never had a romantic relationship with Wilkins, but her fortunes dwindled in the scandal that accompanied the trial.\nMunson once said that her image appeared in more than forty pieces in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum.\nThere used to be water in the park, to feed the fountain, but the plumbing deteriorated decades ago.", "pubDate": null}
