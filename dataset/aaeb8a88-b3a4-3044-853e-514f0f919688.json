See (from left): shirts that go joyfully over-the-top (like this 2017 Off-White c/o Virgil Abloh number); elegant hoop earrings (this one from Khiry); and fabrics riffing on the great indoors (this 2019 look, courtesy of Etro).|||", "Hoop Dreams", "A designer we know advised recently that when you are living so much of your life on Zoom, it\u2019s more flattering if you just lean in and fill up the whole screen. This anti-shrinking-violet advice may be the reason why bold earrings are so desirable at the moment: With your face so often viewed in close-up, an arresting earring invariably has more impact than a delicate little stud. At Schiaparelli\u2019s fall ready-to-wear show, a hoop with spindly tentacles had an eye plopped in the center, an homage to the house\u2019s Surrealist past; at Givenchy, the earring was deconstructed, its loop cleverly undone. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a statement earring\u2014like AOC wears!\u201d says Jameel Mohammed, who began his jewelry line Khiry four years ago, and who has deeply personal reasons for why he believes daring adornment is resonating. \u201cOver the past few years, we\u2019ve been looking at the cultural significance of hoops for people of color who were excluded from conventional notions of beauty.\u201d The hoop\u2014like the one he designed at top right\u2014he says, has its roots in \u201cthe Black Is Beautiful movement, alongside the Afro. The hoop became a signifier of their femininity.\u201d Now, Mohammed says, he is thinking about earrings and gender. \u201cThe world is changing very quickly!\u201d", "Givenchy graphic earrings $875 GIVENCHY Shop Now Khiry Isha hoops with rose quartz $465 KHIRY Shop Now", "Mateo half-moon floating pearl hoop earrings $1,450 MODA OPERANDI Shop Now Paco Rabanne Saturn creole gold-tone hoop earrings $450 NET-A-PORTER Shop Now", "Starting From the Top", "Wouldn\u2019t it be nice, after all this time, to feel neat and pulled-together? Consider the discreet charm of the perfect blouse\u2014even if you\u2019re only dressed up from the waist up! At Balenciaga\u2019s fall 2020 show, a pink polka-dot affair boasted wildly extravagant sleeves; Saint Laurent flaunted versions of the house\u2019s iconic pussycat bow, while shimmering tops from Christopher John Rogers may well wake you up for that morning meeting faster than a double espresso. Simone Rocha, known for her elaborately detailed blouses that manage to be both feminine and feminist, recommends sticking to black or white and dazzling your virtual cohort with a big ruffly sleeve or a Pierrot collar\u2014the better to put the \u201cparty\u201d in Houseparty\u2014while some supersized ruffles on an Off-White piece (above left) are sumptuously hard to ignore. \u201cIt needs to be comfortable when you\u2019re sitting down,\u201d Rocha says, \u201cbut you want something that is beautiful\u2014I feel like such a grown-up in a blouse!\u201d", "", "The designer Nellie Partow thinks the blouses that spark the most joy\u2014and can look the most professional for, say, a virtual job interview\u2014are often deep coral, vivid electric blue, emerald, teal, or saffron.

Maybe it\u2019s because we are spending so much of our downtime exploring our own neighborhoods and avoiding, when we can, taking public transportation, but the tough charm of a combat boot\u2014whether our well-worn Doc Martens or a newer iteration\u2014can make us feel literally more grounded. The current crop manages to be both serious\u2014the ones at Valentino would brook no nonsense\u2014to winsome (well, as winsome as an army boot can be): the chalky whites at Dior are jaunty as sneakers, while Vuitton\u2019s two-tone version kicked up a storm for resort 2016 (previous page). Chris Leba, creative director of the cult brand R13, has a particularly fresh take: His boots are poised on platforms\u2014a deliberate attempt, he says, to tackle and transcend gender assumptions through footwear. \u201cHigh heels can be seen as too feminine, and the flat combat boot is maybe too masculine,\u201d he offers\u2014and thus his affection for the platform boot was born. Leba thinks such boots are meant for the ages: \u201cThey are like your favorite jeans. Right now, we want to grab the things that have been with us for a long time, and the things that hold a special place in our psyches.\u201d", "Dior D-trap ankle boots $1,590 DIOR Shop Now Valentino Garavani V-logo buckle combat boots $1,275 NORDSTROM Shop Now", "Closer to Home", "These days, a house is not just a home\u2014it\u2019s also your office, your playroom, and the place where, more and more, you entertain a select group of people. As we shift from going out to entertaining in our living rooms, it\u2019s not surprising that clothes affording a measure of warmth and comfort are so appealing: Even when you venture outside, it seems, you may want to shelter in place. You might want to wrap yourself in a quilted skirt, reminiscent of a tea cozy and ideal for an intimate dinner party, from Erdem; a coat created from a repurposed bedcovering from Marine Serre; a paisley suit with an upholstery air by Fendi; or a romantic dress, like a shawl, from Etro last year (above center). Emily Adams Bode\u2019s eponymous company specializes in garments created from the literal fabric of our lives: repurposed vintage napkins, curtains, quilts, and tablecloths. Bode says she is fascinated by the hidden narratives these textiles hold. \u201cWhen everything stopped, our employees made one-of-a-kind things from their homes,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI want people to be excited to buy my clothes, and to pass them on,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, that is what clothing is about.\u201d", "Bode fan quilted workwear jacket $1,554 NORDSTROM Shop Now Erdem Mimosa tiered floral jacquard dress $2,995 MATCHESFASHION.COM Shop Now"], "authors": ["Lynn Yaeger", "Lynn Yaege", "Madeline Fas"], "keywords": ["things", "hoop", "boots", "rocha", "pandemicera", "dress", "meant", "rules", "fall", "khiry", "shop", "place", "earrings", "nordstrom"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
