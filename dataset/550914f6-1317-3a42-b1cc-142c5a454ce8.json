She went online and, two days later, took delivery of the test, learning of a positive result via two pink lines. It was the news she had dreaded.", "\u201cI had always hoped to have a large family but with a list of health complications during my first pregnancy and a scar across my tummy to remind me of the ordeal, I was sure that I could not physically or mentally manage to carry a healthy pregnancy,\u201d Kay said. She took the agonising decision to have an abortion. But how?", "Across Europe in spring 2020, as the pandemic was closing down everyday life, so too were the shutters falling on \u201cnon-essential\u201d health services. Drastic decisions were being made by rattled European authorities. In countries where abortion was already a highly contested right and where powerful and vocal anti-abortion lobby groups were on high alert, governments swiftly jumped towards restrictions.", "Abortions would be banned in six countries \u2013 Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Poland \u2013 according to a 46-nation survey published in the British Medical Journal. Surgical abortion was made less available in a further 12 countries and in 11 countries, services were made unavailable or delayed for women with Covid-19 symptoms.", "Abortion became \u201cprobably one of the most endangered rights in Europe\u201d, said David Paternotte, a researcher at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.", "Kay was fortunate in one respect during this troubling, emotionally fraught time. The UK was going another way.", "As some European countries restricted abortion, others took a quite different approach, innovating to minimise in-person consultations in a way that some experts believe could permanently change the face of abortion rights.", "As the likes of Poland slammed doors shut on women, regulatory barriers to abortion have been lifted to varying degrees in 12 countries \u2013 Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Finland, France, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.", "Facebook Twitter A protest in Warsaw against the Polish constitutional court\u2019s ruling restricting abortion rights.

It offered hope to others.", "At the same time, the voices of the Christian right have grown louder and some sympathetic governments have been emboldened to heed their calls. After interviews with women affected, policymakers, activists, lawyers, and providers, this is the story of how the pandemic has widened the inequities in abortion rights across Europe.", "While the pandemic response in Britain and a handful of othernations has offered the future potential for more equality in access to treatment and care for women there are also signs of a worrying backlash, say campaign groups. Progressive policy developments in the UK and elsewhere have been seized on by anti-abortion campaigners as evidence of a need to bolt down the doors.", "\u2018Telemed\u2019 abortions", "On the evening of 30 March 2020, with the UK in full lockdown and abortion services at risk of collapse, the Department of Health and Social Care in Whitehall published a new policy. Women in England would be able, at least temporarily and after a phone or video consultation with a doctor, to take prescribed abortion pills at home, removing the need to travel to a clinic. The Scottish and Welsh health departments followed suit the next day.", "Medical abortions, via pills administered before 10 weeks, account for the vast majority of abortions in the UK. They take place in two stages. Before the coronavirus outbreak, women were legally obliged to take the first pill, mifepristone, at a clinic. The second pill, misoprostol, which taken up to 48 hours later, triggers miscarriage within hours and is usually taken at home \u2013 although even that is a recent reform. Until 2018, women in England had to also take both the first and the second pill at a clinic, with the risk that their pregnancy could end in a taxi or on public transport as they travelled home.", "The pandemic-led shift to full \u201ctelemed abortion\u201d did not come out of nowhere. According to Lord, its advantages had been known for years, and it was included in a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the NHS in England that was published as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidelines in September 2019.", "\u201cNormally there would have been a protracted phase of planning, and then evaluation, and people getting cold feet,\u201d Lord said. \u201cMoving forward, probably, you\u2019re looking at three to five years of getting it embedded.\u201d Then Covid-19 hit, and instead of the lengthy delay Lord had anticipated, the nation\u2019s medical sector realised very quickly that abortion care was \u201cexceptionally vulnerable and totally time-limited\u201d.", "A few other countries were of a like mind. In France and Ireland, the gestational limit of medical abortion at home was raised to nine weeks and the usual mandatory in-person consultation was dispensed with. In Francophone Belgium, although not Dutch-speaking Flanders, abortion centres started promoting medical abortion up to eight weeks at home with phone supervision.", "Abortion became probably one of the most endangered rights in Europe David Paternotte", "For Kay, the new law was a huge relief. \u201cI am ashamed to say I had always been very anti-abortion during my younger years, however, now older and wiser, I researched my options and found out about telemedicine,\u201d she said.", "On a chilly morning in May last year, Kay took the first pill and got on with her day. After 12 hours she had a night fever, sweating and shivering. It was short-lived. She went back to sleep and awoke the next day to take the second round of pills. \u201cI was really scared about the possible side-effects, but a lovely nurse on the end of the helpline reassured me and suggested I inserted the pills vaginally for less risk of side-effects.\u201d", "After four and a half hours, Kay began to pass the pregnancy. No pain, no side-effects, and no different for her than a regular period. Three weeks later, she took the special pregnancy test that came with the pills to ensure the process had ended the pregnancy \u2013 and indeed it had.", "According to Lord, more than 70,000 women in England will have had telemedicine abortion in the year since it was introduced. There were no cases of women having a severe infection or needing major surgery, Lord said. \u201cThe rate of inadvertent late gestation was 0.04%, and all these still had a safe and successful abortion.\u201d Additionally, data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service shows that since the introduction of telemedicine, almost 50% of abortions were performed before seven weeks gestation from January to June 2020, compared with nearly 40% for the same period in 2019. Waiting times for women seeking abortion care have more than halved.", "Kay and others were fortunate to have the treatment they needed when they needed it.

Before the pandemic, abortions had been permitted only where there was a threat to the mother\u2019s life, a foetal abnormality, or where pregnancy had resulted from rape or incest. But in October 2020, Poland\u2019s constitutional tribunal issued a ruling that ended the possibility of legal terminations in cases of foetal abnormality. Almost all abortions had been carried out on those grounds before the ruling.

In Hungary, where again the abortion law with its mandatory counselling and waiting periods had been a point of criticism before the pandemic, a conservative lobby group, CitizenGo, has been campaigning for a suspension of abortion services.

When asked why telemed abortion was deemed dangerous, Tom Allen from Christian Concern said: \u201cFor a start, the government thinks it is dangerous. This is what health minister Lord [James] Bethell said when the service was proposed on the eve of lockdown in March.\u201d He also cited a report in the Sun newspaper on a murder investigation related to the service, and an \u201cundercover investigation\u201d carried out by a consultancy firm run by Duffy.", "Underground networks", "The inevitable result is that where abortion has been heavily restricted, women have been forced by their circumstances to look to the black market. There are organisations, such as Women on Web (WoW) and Women Help Women, who appear motivated by the best of intentions to get pills to desperate women, using meticulously researched strategies to avoid seizure by customs officials \u2013 a problem encountered mainly in Italy and Poland. Last June the Spanish government blocked access to WoW\u2019s website without warning.
