Instead of one big ceremony with several friends and loved ones gathering in the same place, couples are pivoting to virtual ceremonies and safely planning a series of micro weddings.", "\u201cA lot of the brides we are styling now are having multiple events,\u201d says Anny Choi, head stylist at Over The Moon. \u201cWith not everyone vaccinated yet and uncertainty around travel, we\u2019ve noticed couples splitting up events between close, older family members and the friends group.\u201d In most cases, multiple events mean multiple looks for the bride, and \u201cinstead of putting all eggs in one basket with a more expensive bridal designer, a bride might look to buy something from a contemporary ready to wear designer to split up costs,\u201d says Choi. One of the easiest ways to discover those need-to-know designers? Browsing online.", "When you walk into a store, you\u2019re typically beholden to what\u2019s inside those four walls, but the internet broadens your choices, granting every bride, no matter their location, access to emerging designers who are redefining the definition of evening wear and bridal attire. \u201cThere is also easier access to international brands,\u201d Choi adds.", "Navigating the web for such a momentous occasion can be a daunting task, but \u201ca good rule of thumb is if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Brown explains. \u201cWe recommend brides be wary of stores promising high-end designer gowns for unbelievably low prices. Pay attention to the URL and the overall look and feel of the online store. Are the photos grainy? Are the product descriptions vague or poorly written? If something seems off, it could be a counterfeit site.\u201d", "Similarly, don\u2019t forget to read the fine print on return policies and shipping costs and delivery dates. Also steer clear of anything that\u2019s final sale, as those selects are ineligible for returns. \u201cThe last thing you would want is to take a risk on attire that you can\u2019t return,\u201d says Brown.", "Once you\u2019ve found a trustworthy website and a dress you love, don\u2019t just settle for one picture. \u201cSee if you can find the look you\u2019re hoping to purchase on several different sites and compare imagery,\u201d Alexandra Macon, Vogue contributing editor and founder of Over The Moon, suggests. \u201cGo to the brand\u2019s Instagram page as well, so you can review any editorial campaign photos where the look is on a model.\u201d", "Seeing the dress in various photos will also come in handy when choosing the best size for you. Some websites\u2014like My Theresa, Net-A-Porter, and MatchesFashion.com\u2014will also share details on what exact size the model is wearing. Use that information to decipher your own size in relation to the model\u2019s. \u201cOnce you figure out this base system of, \u2018Oh I\u2019m always two sizes up from the sample size,\u2019 it\u2019s easier to figure out your size,\u201d says Choi. \u201cEspecially when you are converting UK, Italian, French, and AUS sizing.\u201d", "In addition to international sizing conversions, bridal sizing, in general, can be totally different from traditional sizing. It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re reading the details. Taking your measurements is also extremely helpful. \u201cWe recommend measuring your bust, waist, and hips and having those measurements on hand so you can use the store\u2019s sizing chart to assess the best size for you,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIf you\u2019re between sizes or confused about where you fall on the size chart, email customer service.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to make phone calls. Brands and retailers with great customer service will be more than happy to answer any questions.", "Recent bride Sierra Tishgart, founder of Great Jones and whose wedding was featured in Vogue, actually tracked down her resort 2017 Alexander McQueen wedding dress, which she first saw online, by dialing up the fashion house. I felt very drawn to the pops of color and the embroidered flowers on this McQueen dress,\u201d says Tishgart. \u201cI didn\u2019t seriously consider any others\u2014I devoted my time and energy to tracking down this specific runway look.\u201d", "Once it was finally delivered to her, the gown was several sizes too large. \u201cIt needed major alterations\u2014so many that I wasn\u2019t even sure they could be done,\u201d Tishgart explains. But it\u2019s always wiser to size up because items can easily be taken in. If they\u2019re too small, adding fabric isn\u2019t really an option. \u201cI reached out to tailor extraordinaire Bill Bull, who performed surgery to make my dress fit perfectly,\u201d Tishgart adds. \u201cI think he even spoke to Sarah Burton\u2019s team at McQueen about it directly.\u201d It\u2019s also important to hire a tailor who knows how to work with fine fabrics. When Tishgart\u2019s gown was finally delivered, she says, \u201cThe embroidery and the tulle were even more beautiful than I imagined, but also extremely delicate.\u201d", "Tishgart was so pleased with the \u201cbuy now, try it on later\u201d experience that she also purchased her Rodarte reception look during a Net-A-Porter sale. Since she\u2019s been recommending buying a wedding dress online to friends. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best way to get a great value, as you\u2019re more inclined to find a good sale or archive runway dress online,\u201d says Tishgart.", "Now that you\u2019re equipped with all the tips and tricks to keep in mind while buying a wedding dress online, discover 19 of our favorite styles available for purchase right now."], "authors": ["Alexis Bennett", "Alexis Bennet"], "keywords": ["look", "tishgart", "tricks", "size", "dress", "wedding", "online", "consider", "youre", "sizing", "choi", "buy", "bride", "tips", "gowns"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
