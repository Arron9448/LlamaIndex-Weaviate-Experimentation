Every time it reappeared on the studio schedule, his heart sank. So he was gratified when, in 2016, he learned that this hard-won song would appear in a new HBO miniseries called Big Little Lies. He assumed it would feature in just one scene. It was only when his social media following spiked and his US tour dates sold out immediately after the series debuted that he realised it was the actual theme tune. America, which had previously ignored him, was suddenly paying attention, albeit only to one song. At every promotional appearance he had to play Cold Little Heart. He was even invited to perform it on the Californian bridge featured in Big Little Lies but politely declined. He jokes that his US label would love it if he included Cold Little Heart on his new album, Kiwanuka, as well. He looks, if this is possible, apologetically annoyed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful, entitled artist, but I do have other music.\u201d", "Frankly, it would be hard to find a musician less ungrateful and entitled than Kiwanuka. I suspect that the routine comparisons to Bill Withers and Terry Callier aren\u2019t just because he\u2019s a black man with a tender, supple voice and an acoustic guitar but because his music radiates warmth and decency. Trailing shopping bags on the terrace of the Soho House members\u2019 club in London one sunny afternoon, the 32-year-old is no less likable. He\u2019s come up from Southampton, where he recently moved with his wife after a lifetime in north London. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rock\u2019n\u2019roll place,\u201d he concedes, \u201cbut that suits me.\u201d He greets questions with words of encouragement (\u201cYes! 100%!\u201d) and, on the rare occasions when he feels compelled to swear, opts for a U-rated \u201cflipping\u201d.", "In the past, Kiwanuka thinks, he has suffered from an excess of humility. After school, Fortismere comprehensive in Muswell Hill, he dreamed of becoming a jazz guitarist but dropped out of the Royal Academy of Music after a discouraging end-of-year report. \u201cI would always just quit when things got difficult,\u201d he says guiltily. \u201cSomebody would put me down and I\u2019d believe them.\u201d He settled into a low-key career as a session guitarist, performing his own songs in pubs as a sideline. If record labels had turned him down, he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have lost a wink of sleep. There was nothing to lose so it became an adventure.\u201d", "In fact, the opposite happened. He signed to Polydor and pipped Frank Ocean to pole position in the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2012 poll. His rootsy, reassuring debut album, Home Again, went gold. But then self-doubt returned with a vengeance. Invited to join the sessions for Kanye West\u2019s Yeezus, he felt intimidated and inadequate (\u201cReally he just wanted me to be me\u201d) and eventually sloped out. Discouraged by an unsympathetic A&R man, he scrapped an entire second album, Night Songs. \u201cI was kind of lost,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was thinking of giving up. You get to the point where you\u2019ll try anything.\u201d", "The result, recorded with new producer Inflo, was Black Man in a White World, a song about not fitting in set to a handclap rhythm inspired by the bluesman Son House. \u201cI was like, nobody\u2019s going to listen to this but let\u2019s just do it.\u201d That demo was what hooked Danger Mouse, Grammy-winning producer for the likes of U2, the Black Keys, Gorillaz and Beck. Kiwanuka usually finds that he is at his most successful when he least expects it. \u201cThe benefit of nobody caring about you is you come up with your best stuff. You\u2019re free.\u201d He smiles. \u201cObviously at the time I didn\u2019t see it like that.\u201d", "Love & Hate rose to No 1 on a tide of unanimous acclaim and is widely considered one of the decade\u2019s classic albums. As well as Big Little Lies, Kiwanuka\u2019s songs have popped up in Atlanta, Empire and When They See Us, while the man himself made a cameo appearance in Danny Boyle\u2019s Yesterday. He noticed other encouraging signs. More prestigious artists were watching his festival sets from the side of the stage. His meetings at the record label were no longer scheduled for the end of the day. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like scoring a hat-trick in school,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get this kudos around the playground.\u201d", "Surely all of this did wonders for his confidence?", "\u201cYeeeah,\u201d he says hesitantly. Really? \u201cYes and no.\u201d Insecurity is cunning and insidious. Having failed without Danger Mouse and Inflo, he wondered if he owed all his success to them. \u201cI was definitely more confident outwardly but in the studio I would cower: Somebody\u2019s going to find me out. Without the superheroes I\u2019m rubbish.\u201d", "As he recorded Kiwanuka in London, New York and Los Angeles, he didn\u2019t just conquer this anxiety but made it the theme of a record that is even more extraordinary than Love & Hate: a heavy soul masterpiece with traces of Gil Scott-Heron, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, David Axelrod and DJ Shadow. You Ain\u2019t the Problem, the joyful first track, is both an encouraging message to listeners and a memo to himself. \u201cI got tired of impostor syndrome and self-doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m living my dream. I\u2019m in the room. And I was wasting it with thoughts of inferiority. I\u2019ve always had that annoying [inner] voice and after 30 years you\u2019re like, \u2018Shut up, I\u2019ve had enough of this\u2019.\u201d", "The album title is an emphatic statement about self-acceptance. Muswell Hill is an overwhelmingly white area of north London, and at school Kiwanuka would dread new teachers reading the register for the first time because he\u2019d always have to correct them. When he visited family in Uganda, where it\u2019s pronounced Chi-wa-nuka, people would disapprove of the anglicised Kiwa-nu-ka. \u201cEverywhere I went it was wrong.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kiwanuka performing at End of the Road festival in August. Photograph: Burak \u00c7\u0131ng\u0131/Redferns", "These memories resurfaced when he signed to Polydor and was asked if he wanted to adopt a stage name. Kiwanuka, it was suggested, was hard to say and might give the impression that he was a world music artist. \u201cIt really pissed me off,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminded me of being seven at the back of the class.\u201d Kiwanuka\u2019s title, wedded to a regal portrait by the Atlanta artist Markeidric Walker, is his belated \u201cprotest\u201d. It helps, he says, that the world has changed in the past decade. \u201cNobody would dream of saying that now. Now it\u2019s cool to be from Africa and have a difficult name. But back then it was just another thing to make me potentially ashamed of who I am.\u201d", "Kiwanuka\u2019s relationship with his name symbolises the sense of unbelonging that he described in Black Man in a White World. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel represented in black culture and definitely not in middle-class white culture,\u201d he says of growing up. \u201cWhen I saw an image of Bill Withers or Isaac Hayes or Hendrix I could relate to that. That\u2019s what gave me the courage to play.\u201d At university, he wrote an essay about artists such as Leadbelly and Ray Charles who blurred the artificial distinction between black and white music. \u201cI found it such an encouraging thing, looking back and finding people who felt like comrades.\u201d One of the only contemporary musicians who represented that same freedom was Danger Mouse. \u201cI thought, when I grow up I want to be like this guy. That\u2019s me.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018People need imperfection, they need grain, they need out-of-tune notes.\u2019 Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer", "So far, Kiwanuka\u2019s concert audiences have been as white as Muswell Hill, but he hopes to reach more people like him. \u201cSome artists are singing to their people and I don\u2019t know who mine are. I\u2019m jealous when I see the way people from Brooklyn talk about Jay-Z: \u2018That\u2019s my guy.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that. I don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019m not representing anyone. I wrestle with that because there\u2019s nothing like being part of a community.\u201d Then again, he sometimes meets artists who envy his freedom from the expectation to represent. He thinks that identity is \u2013 and should be \u2013 complicated.", "Accustomed to being an outsider, Kiwanuka is surprised to find himself less anomalous than ever. He has always been an analogue soul in a digital world but he no longer sees himself tagged as retro. From rappers sporting bushy beards to R&B artists making idiosyncratic, hitless concept albums, he sees evidence of an aesthetic that is less slick, more sprawling, and defiantly imperfect. Even the tense political climate feels simpatico with the spirit of 1970s soul: \u201cRaw music for raw times.\u201d So his decision to conceive Kiwanuka as four sides of vinyl, strung together by instrumental interludes and sampled memories of civil rights sit-ins doesn\u2019t feel at all like an eccentric throwback.", "An amateur analogue photographer, Kiwanuka compares the album format to a Kodak camera. \u201cIt was meant to die but humans brought it back. People need that tactile reality. They need imperfection, they need grain, they need out-of-tune notes, they need vinyl that wears out, they need paint that looks old that you buy from posh shops. It\u2019s a reaction against this fast-paced, throwaway, machine-led world. It keeps us feeling alive.\u201d Better that, he says, than Instagram\u2019s cult of perfection. \u201cSocial media is something I really worry about because none of it is true. I think it\u2019s going to affect our resilience. Life isn\u2019t easy. If we\u2019re worrying about not being perfect, we\u2019re going to really struggle.\u201d", "Thus the sound of the album chimes with its theme of accepting his name, his identity, and his flaws. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect but neither is he or she,\u201d he sums up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d", "Kiwanuka gathers his shopping bags to get the train to Southampton. He\u2019s back in London tomorrow for a radio session. The song he\u2019s been asked to play, he says with an amiable shrug, is Cold Little Heart.", "Kiwanuka is out 1 November on Polydor"], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
