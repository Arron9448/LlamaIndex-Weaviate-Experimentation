Here are the best revision methods.", "Keep it active", "One of the most effective ideas is to rewrite your notes and say things out loud, according to Carina Cunha of tutoring firm Crimson Education. \u201cRewriting your notes can help trigger your memory,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can also help you organise the material better, making your notes easier to understand and absorb. It\u2019s beneficial to then read them aloud \u2013 you are more likely to remember something this way than you would by reading the material in your head.\u201d", "From dog-petting to desk yoga: do 'wellbeing weeks' make university less stressful?

Is it for longer periods of time or short bursts with more breaks?\u201d", "Revision guides often point to the morning as the most productive time for hitting the books but that isn\u2019t always the case, according to Sophie Valentine, a science tutor at MyTutor. \u201cRecent research has found that teenagers need between eight and 10 hours of sleep for their brain to be fully rested, compared to just seven hours for an adult. So it could be better to have a lie-in and be 100% ready to get started later in the day.\u201d", "Break down your time and build in rewards", "Make yourself a realistic revision timetable. There\u2019s no point setting up a packed 7am-to-midnight learning schedule with a five-minute break for two meals: you\u2019ll soon feel overwhelmed and give up. In my first year of uni, I used my old school timetable as a model for my revision time: it meant learning for 40-minute chunks, with regular breaks and an hour off for lunch, as well as time off in the afternoon to properly relax and get outside for some fresh air. Alternatively, there are lots of sample timetables to download online. Don\u2019t forget to build in mini-rewards for each time you hit a target like learning a chapter of a textbook \u2013 I found chocolate to be a pretty useful learning incentive.", "Draw diagrams, use mind maps, make lists", "\u201cDiagrams work well when studying for anatomy or biology exams, and you are trying to memorise a process or a set of relationships,\u201d says Cunha. The nature of revision means you\u2019ll need to work solo some of the time, but partnering with a friend who works in a similar way to you can help you to reinforce learning and test each other. Sites like Quizlet can be useful: you can make your own flashcards, mini-tests and even games to help you to learn facts. You can also access some 300m study sets created by other students on topics stretching from film and graphic design to science, economics, and languages.", "How to make your first year at uni count \u2013 even if your grades don't Read more", "Don\u2019t stick to your desk", "Stick revision notes on your bathroom mirror, by the kettle, or near the loo.

She explains: \u201cIt may well be possible to figure out patterns from past questions if you look long enough, but it\u2019s definitely not the most effective way to spend revision time. Relying too heavily on clues can end up with students getting caught out in the exam hall.\u201d", "Avoid your phone", "Try an app like Offtime or another digital detoxers \u2013 it blocks texts and notifications, restricts access to apps and will even limit your phone usage."], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["revision", "way", "notes", "exam", "experts", "revise", "help", "exams", "christmas", "students", "ruining", "youll", "work", "learning"], "id": "7400125a-fa34-3ced-8883-661220cb96b2", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Lucy Tobin"], "title": "How to revise without ruining Christmas \u2013 by exam experts"}
