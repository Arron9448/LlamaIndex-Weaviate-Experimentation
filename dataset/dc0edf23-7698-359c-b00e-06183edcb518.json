Here they are, sat side-by-side in their little Zoom windows, each dialling in from their homes in Copenhagen. \u201cBut we are not close at all,\u201d Nicolas explains by way of introduction. \u201cHe\u2019s in the suburbs and I\u2019m in the city.\u201d Physically, spiritually, the two are poles apart.", "I have known Refn Jr\u2019s work for years. He is the upstart talent behind Drive, The Neon Demon and the Pusher trilogy. He is beguiling, exasperating, almost endlessly watchable. But I am less familiar with 76-year-old Anders, who has steered a quieter course as a sometime director and a prolific film editor; the sort of safe pair of hands that cleans up the mess made by others. At one stage he explains that he shot his debut feature, Copper, way back in 1976. \u201cMy first film was about a policeman. Nicolas\u2019s first film was about a criminal.\u201d He chuckles at the comparison. \u201cSo we are like two sides of the same coin.\u201d", "Ryan Gosling and Nicolas Winding Refn presenting Drive at Cannes in 2011. Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images", "Today, for once, the old guard seems to have come out on top. Anders Refn\u2019s latest film, Into the Darkness, is a meaty, richly textured period piece, a film that views the Nazi occupation of Denmark through the prism of a bourgeois family\u2019s meltdown. It is the first part of a story he has wanted to tell for years, an antidote to all the phoney, self-serving accounts of heroic resistance. Occupied Denmark, he explains, was known as the \u201cWhipped Cream Front\u201d. It was sweet and supine, a cushy posting for German troops, the Nazi equivalent of a work jolly. \u201cCollaboration has been a taboo subject in our country for so many years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think audiences are finally ready to confront it.\u201d", "Nicolas, for his part, wants to support the film and champion his father. But he is the world\u2019s worst publicist, a film critic in disguise. When I ask what he thought of Into the Darkness, he says that it\u2019s an accomplished movie about an important topic. He says it\u2019s a successful piece of storytelling. Of course, it\u2019s not the sort of movie that he would ever dream of making himself. \u201cFundamentally, I think my father and I disagree on the purpose of cinema,\u201d he says. \u201cHe comes out of a more classical tradition. For him, it\u2019s a story, a narrative. For me, it\u2019s more of an act of expression.\u201d", "Into The Darkness, Anders Refn\u2019s new film. Photograph: Vertigo Releasing", "I have just asked Refn Jr for his unvarnished opinion on his father\u2019s work. It is only fair that we turn the tables. Take a film like The Neon Demon, Nicolas\u2019s dark fairytale about the Los Angeles modelling scene. It is stylish, sugar-frosted and poisonous to its core. But I wonder what Anders made of it all.", "Anders looks stricken. \u201cWhat did I think of it?\u201d he says. \u201cUm \u2026\u201d", "\u201cMy father thinks The Neon Demon is inconsistent,\u201d Nicolas chips in. \u201cHe feels it lacks a conventional narrative. He doesn\u2019t like anything that\u2019s supernatural. He doesn\u2019t like anything that doesn\u2019t relay the 60s political dogmatic attitude towards science.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d protests Anders. \u201cNo.\u201d But it is all he can do to get a word in edgeways.", "I think they love each other. I think that they lock antlers for fun, or from habit. The trouble is that Anders is a child of postwar European arthouse cinema, whereas his son was raised on a diet of American grindhouse and horror movies. Nicolas explains that his parents broke up when he was small. After that he lived in New York with his mum and stepfather. He says: \u201cMy life changed when I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don\u2019t think my father\u2019s ever seen that film.\u201d", "Elle Fanning in Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s 2016 film, The Neon Demon. Photograph: Allstar/Icon Film Distribution", "\u201cHalf of it,\u201d Anders says.", "\u201cYeah, half of it.\u201d Nicolas snorts. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s just the vilest trash.\u201d", "I ask if they can think of a happy filmgoing memory and Anders recalls the time he took the teenaged Nicolas to see Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Summer With Monika. \u201cHe was saying: \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t want to see this old black-and-white film.\u2019 He liked films like Star Wars and Ghostbusters. And he sat with his head down while the film was rolling. And I felt bad because I thought I\u2019d been too pushy. So I said: \u2018OK, Nicolas, do you want to go?\u2019 And he looked up to me with tears in his eyes because he was so touched by the film.\u201d", "Now it is the younger man\u2019s turn to protest. \u201cThis, of course, is completely untrue. It\u2019s all my father\u2019s romanticisation. Yeah, I saw Summer With Monika at the Cinematek in Copenhagen. And, yes, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a very accomplished film. But I certainly don\u2019t remember it the way that he does. I can\u2019t imagine anyone \u2013 let alone me \u2013 crying at a Bergman movie.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMaybe crying to get out.\u201d", "Anders points out that for a while he and his son\u2019s careers followed a similar pattern. Both men scored a hit with their debut film, did OK with their second, and crashed and burned with their third. In Nicolas\u2019s case, the film in question was Fear X, an existential American thriller that tanked at the box office and left him $1m in debt. As for Anders, he is still stung by the collapse of his cherished 1985 circus melodrama The Flying Devils. He recalls that Bergman had a print of the film shipped to his home on the Baltic island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, watched the entire thing twice and wrote a very nice letter.", "A shared memory: Anders took Nicolas to see Ingmar Bergman\u2019s 1953 classic Summer With Monika.

It gave me clarity about who I was and what I wanted to do.\u201d", "Anders\u2019s experience appears to have been slightly different. \u201cIt was very painful,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it made me so picky about whatever films I did afterwards. Because you have to go all in knowing that you might not succeed.\u201d He laughs mirthlessly. \u201cAlso, making a film, it costs me a marriage each time.\u201d", "These days Anders is perhaps best known as Lars von Trier\u2019s right-hand man. He edited Breaking the Waves and Antichrist. He was the assistant director on Dancer in the Dark, Dogville, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac. It\u2019s a collaboration, he says, that has turned him into a more radical film-maker. On the set of Into the Darkness, for instance, he found himself loosening up \u2013 shooting with two handheld cameras and catching the action on the run. Assuming the pandemic can be brought under control, he plans to start filming the second instalment in May.", "Charlotte Gainsbourg in Antichrist, the Lars Von Trier film that Anders Refn edited. Photograph: Allstar/Artificial Eye/Sportsphoto Ltd.", "The way Nicolas sees it, he and his father were simply born into different times and raised in different places: Edenic Scandinavia; jaundiced 80s New York. If anything, he envies the innocence of Anders\u2019s early years, back at the dawn of the French New Wave. \u201cI can totally understand the passion of that era. Because cinema was life. The innovative art-form. The ultimate art-form. Pure and moralistic. It could change the world. No one will ever experience film like that again.\u201d", "Slowly, grudgingly, the two seem to be inching towards common ground. Nicolas heaves a sigh. \u201cWe come from very different backgrounds,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a fundamental difference in our approach to cinema. But, at the end of the day, I\u2019ve probably learned more from my father than from any other film-maker. He\u2019s taught me about the subliminal power of the editing process. The importance of getting into a scene late and getting out early. The importance of keeping your focus, never letting an audience get bored. I\u2019ve stopped showing my father my work these days. But I always keep his advice at the back of my mind.\u201d", "They clashed on the subject of Summer With Monika. They will always disagree about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I am wondering if there is one film in the world they both unequivocally love.", "\u201cOf course,\u201d says Nicolas, without missing a beat. \u201cThe Leopard, by Visconti.\u201d", "Anders pitches in, hard on his son\u2019s heels. \u201cThe Seven Samurai, by Kurosawa.
