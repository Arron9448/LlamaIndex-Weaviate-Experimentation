He has only one eye, having sacrificed the other for wisdom. Among his many talents, he can wake the dead, calm storms, cure the sick, and blind his enemies. Not infrequently, he transforms himself into an animal; as a snake, he acquires the gift of poetry, which he transfers to people, inadvertently.", "The Odin, in Oakland, California, is a company that sells genetic-engineering kits. The company\u2019s founder, Josiah Zayner, sports a side-swept undercut, multiple piercings, and a tattoo that urges: \u201cCreate Something Beautiful.\u201d He holds a Ph.D. in biophysics and is a well-known provocateur. Among his many stunts, he has coaxed his skin to produce a fluorescent protein, ingested a friend\u2019s poop in a D.I.Y. fecal-matter transplant, and attempted to deactivate one of his genes so that he could grow bigger muscles. (This last effort, he acknowledges, failed.) Zayner calls himself a genetic designer and has said that his goal is to give people access to the resources they need to modify life in their spare time.", "The Odin\u2019s offerings range from a \u201cBiohack the Planet\u201d shot glass, which costs three bucks, to a \u201cgenetic engineering home lab kit,\u201d which runs almost two thousand dollars and includes a centrifuge, a polymerase-chain-reaction machine, and an electrophoresis gel box. I opted for something in between: the \u201cbacterial CRISPR and fluorescent yeast combo kit,\u201d which set me back two hundred and nine dollars. It came in a cardboard box decorated with the company\u2019s logo, a twisting tree circled by a double helix. The tree, I believe, is supposed to represent Yggdrasil, whose trunk, in Norse mythology, rises through the center of the cosmos.", "Inside the box, I found an assortment of lab tools\u2014pipette tips, petri dishes, disposable gloves\u2014as well as several vials containing E. coli and all I\u2019d need to rearrange its genome. The E. coli went into the fridge, next to the butter. The other vials went into a bin in the freezer, with the ice cream.", "Genetic engineering is, by now, middle-aged. The first genetically engineered bacterium was produced in 1973. This was soon followed by a genetically engineered mouse, in 1974, and a genetically engineered tobacco plant, in 1983. The first genetically engineered food approved for human consumption, the Flavr Savr tomato, was introduced in 1994; it proved such a disappointment that it went out of production a few years later. Genetically engineered varieties of corn and soy were developed around the same time; these, by contrast, have become more or less ubiquitous.", "In the past decade or so, genetic engineering has undergone its own transformation, thanks to CRISPR\u2014shorthand for a suite of techniques, mostly borrowed from bacteria, that make it vastly easier for biohackers and researchers to manipulate DNA. (The acronym stands for \u201cclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\u201d) CRISPR allows its users to snip a stretch of DNA and then either disable the affected sequence or replace it with a new one.", "The possibilities that follow are pretty much endless. Jennifer Doudna, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the developers of CRISPR, has put it like this: we now have \u201ca way to rewrite the very molecules of life any way we wish.\u201d With CRISPR, biologists have already created\u2014among many, many other living things\u2014ants that can\u2019t smell, beagles that put on superhero-like brawn, pigs that resist swine fever, macaques that suffer from sleep disorders, coffee beans that contain no caffeine, salmon that don\u2019t lay eggs, mice that don\u2019t get fat, and bacteria whose genes contain, in code, Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s famous series of photographs showing a horse in motion. Two years ago, a Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, announced that he had produced the world\u2019s first CRISPR-edited humans, twin baby girls. According to He, the girls\u2019 genes had been tweaked to confer resistance to H.I.V., though whether this is actually the case remains unclear. Following his announcement, He was fired from his academic post, in Shenzhen, and sentenced to three years in prison.", "I have almost no experience in genetics and have not done hands-on lab work since high school. Still, by following the instructions that came in the box from the Odin, in the course of a weekend I was able to create a novel organism. First I grew a colony of E. coli in one of the petri dishes. Then I doused it with the various proteins and bits of designer DNA I\u2019d stored in the freezer. The process swapped out one \u201cletter\u201d of the bacteria\u2019s genome, replacing an \u201cA\u201d (adenine) with a \u201cC\u201d (cytosine). Thanks to this emendation, my new and improved E. coli could, in effect, thumb its nose at streptomycin, a powerful antibiotic. Although it felt a little creepy engineering a drug-resistant strain of E. coli in my kitchen, there was also a definite sense of achievement, so much so that I decided to move on to the second project in the kit: inserting a jellyfish gene into yeast in order to make it glow.", "The Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, in the city of Geelong, is one of the most advanced high-containment laboratories in the world. It sits behind two sets of gates, the second of which is intended to foil truck bombers, and its poured-concrete walls are thick enough, I was told, to withstand a plane crash. There are five hundred and twenty air-lock doors at the facility and four levels of security. \u201cIt\u2019s where you\u2019d want to be in the zombie apocalypse,\u201d a staff member told me. Until recently, the center was known as the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, and at the highest biosecurity level\u2014BSL-4\u2014there are vials of some of the nastiest animal-borne pathogens on the planet, including Ebola. (The laboratory gets a shout-out in the movie \u201cContagion.\u201d) Staff members who work in BSL-4 units can\u2019t wear their own clothes into the lab and have to shower for at least three minutes before heading home. The animals at the facility, for their part, can\u2019t leave at all. \u201cTheir only way out is through the incinerator\u201d is how one employee put it to me.", "About a year ago, not long before the pandemic began, I paid a visit to the center, which is an hour southwest of Melbourne. The draw was an experiment on a species of giant toad known familiarly as the cane toad. The toad was introduced to Australia as an agent of pest control, but it promptly got out of control itself, producing an ecological disaster. Researchers at the A.C.D.P. were hoping to put the toad back in the bottle, as it were, using CRISPR.", "A molecular biologist named Mark Tizard, who was in charge of the project, had agreed to show me around. Tizard is a slight man with a fringe of white hair and twinkling blue eyes. Like many of the scientists I met in Australia, he\u2019s from somewhere else\u2014in his case, England. Before getting into amphibians, Tizard worked mostly on poultry. Several years ago, he and some colleagues at the center inserted a jellyfish gene into a hen. This gene, similar to the one I was planning to plug into my yeast, encodes a fluorescent protein. A chicken in possession of it will, as a consequence, emit an eerie glow under UV light. Next, Tizard figured out a way to insert the fluorescence gene so that it would be passed down to male offspring only. The result is a hen whose chicks can be sexed while they\u2019re still in their shells.", "Tizard knows that many people are freaked out by genetically modified organisms. They find the idea of eating them repugnant, and of releasing them into the world anathema. Though he\u2019s no provocateur, he, like Zayner, believes that such people are looking at things all wrong. \u201cWe have chickens that glow green,\u201d Tizard told me. \u201cAnd so we have school groups that come, and when they see the green chicken, you know, some of the kids go, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s really cool. Hey, if I eat that chicken, will I turn green?\u2019 And I\u2019m, like, \u2018You eat chicken already, right? Have you grown feathers and a beak?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t stand the cold\u2014I just hate the holidays.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Carolita Johnson", "Anyway, according to Tizard, it\u2019s too late to be worried about a few genes here and there. \u201cIf you look at a native Australian environment, you see eucalyptus trees, koalas, kookaburras, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I look at it, as a scientist, what I\u2019m seeing is multiple copies of the eucalyptus genome, multiple copies of the koala genome, and so on. And these genomes are interacting with each other. Then, all of a sudden, ploomph, you put an additional genome in there\u2014the cane-toad genome. It was never there before, and its interaction with all these other genomes is catastrophic. It takes other genomes out completely.\u201d He went on, \u201cWhat people are not seeing is that this is already a genetically modified environment.\u201d Invasive species alter the environment by adding entire creatures that don\u2019t belong. Genetic engineers, by contrast, just alter a few stretches of DNA here and there.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is potentially adding maybe ten more genes onto the twenty thousand toad genes that shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place, and those ten will sabotage the rest and take them out of the system and so restore balance,\u201d Tizard said. \u201cThe classic thing people say with molecular biology is: Are you playing God? Well, no. We are using our understanding of biological processes to see if we can benefit a system that is in trauma.\u201d", "Formally known as Rhinella marina, cane toads are a splotchy brown, with thick limbs and bumpy skin. Descriptions inevitably emphasize their size. \u201cRhinella marina is an enormous, warty bufonid (true toad),\u201d the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service notes. The U.S. Geological Survey observes that \u201clarge individuals sitting on roadways are easily mistaken for boulders.\u201d The biggest cane toad ever recorded was fifteen inches long and weighed six pounds\u2014as much as a chubby chihuahua. A toad named Big Bette, who lived at the Queensland Museum, in Brisbane, in the nineteen-eighties, was nine and a half inches long and almost as wide\u2014about the size of a dinner plate. The toads will eat almost anything they can fit in their oversized mouths, including mice, dog food, and other cane toads.", "Cane toads are native to South America, Central America, and the southernmost tip of Texas. In the mid-eighteen-hundreds, they were brought to the Caribbean. The idea was to enlist the toads in the battle against beetle grubs, which were plaguing the region\u2019s cash crop, sugar cane. (Sugar cane, too, is an import; it is native to New Guinea.) From the Caribbean, the toads were shipped to Hawaii. In 1935, a hundred and two toads were loaded onto a steamer in Honolulu, headed for Australia. A hundred and one survived the journey and ended up at a research station in sugar-cane country, in northeast Queensland. Within a year, they\u2019d produced more than 1.5 million eggs. (A female cane toad can produce up to thirty thousand eggs at a go.) The resulting toadlets were intentionally released into the region\u2019s rivers and ponds.", "It\u2019s doubtful that the toads ever did the sugar cane much good. Cane beetles perch too high off the ground for a boulder-size amphibian to reach. This didn\u2019t faze the toads. They found plenty else to eat, and continued to produce toadlets by the truckload. From a sliver of the Queensland coast, they pushed north, into the Cape York Peninsula, and south, into New South Wales. Sometime in the nineteen-eighties, they crossed into the Northern Territory. In 2005, they reached a spot known as Middle Point, in the western part of the Territory, not far from the city of Darwin.", "Along the way, something curious happened. In the early phase of the invasion, the toads were advancing at the rate of about six miles a year. A few decades later, they were moving at the pace of twelve miles a year. By the time they hit Middle Point, they\u2019d sped up to thirty miles a year. When researchers measured the individuals at the invasion front, they found out why. The toads had significantly longer legs than the toads back in Queensland, and this trait was heritable. The Northern Territory News played the story on its front page, under the headline \u201cSUPER TOAD.\u201d Accompanying the article was a doctored photo of a cane toad wearing a cape. \u201cIt has invaded the Territory and now the hated cane toad is evolving,\u201d the newspaper gasped. Contra Darwin, it seemed, evolution could be observed in real time."], "authors": ["Elizabeth Kolbert", "Elizabeth Kolber"], "keywords": ["genes", "genetically", "tizard", "engineered", "crispr", "toads", "toad", "way", "survive", "coli", "cane", "splice", "genome"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
