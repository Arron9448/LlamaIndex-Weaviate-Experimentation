And on that, Harry Styles has you covered.", "The pop star is capping off a year of chart-topping success and Grammy nominations for his sophomore album Fine Line (and, lest we forget, a headline-grabbing Vogue cover) with a surprise video, released earlier today, for his song \u201cTreat People With Kindness.\u201d The black-and-white visual sees Styles as a cabaret star performing in an Art Deco nightclub, decked out in a head-to-toe Gucci look featuring a glittering cropped tuxedo jacket, high-waisted Jazz Age trousers, and a Fred Astaire-worthy sequinned bow tie.", "It wasn\u2019t just the timing of the video\u2019s release that came as a surprise, however, but also Styles\u2019s co-star: none other than Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The Fleabag and Killing Eve creator appears as a punter at the club in a white 1930s-style suit of her own and sipping a martini, before being led on stage by Styles to reveal matching sequined golfing sweaters. The pair bust out a routine together, before the rapturous audience erupts into dance for a Busby Berkeley-inspired finale. The final shot? Waller-Bridge holding Styles, while looking cheekily to the camera in classic Fleabag style. If that doesn\u2019t get you feeling a little bit brighter about the year ahead, then who knows what will."], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["styles", "youre", "visual", "fleabag", "vogue", "white", "dose", "star", "video", "cheer", "surprise", "wasnt", "welcome", "styless", "harry", "wallerbridge"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
