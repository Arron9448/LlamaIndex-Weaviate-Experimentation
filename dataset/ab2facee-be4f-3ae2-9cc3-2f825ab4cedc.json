Instead he sat and watched as Player and Nicklaus did. It was a poignant moment, despite the way Player\u2019s son (and caddie) Wayne, hovered over Elder\u2019s shoulder cradling a branded box of golf balls, like a model on the shopping channel.", "It looked like a ham-fisted bit of guerrilla marketing. Player denied it. \u201cThe only thought from that point was that it would be cool for fans to know what ball my dad was teeing off with,\u201d he told Golf Digest, which also reported he has a stake in that particular ball manufacturer. \u201cThat\u2019s where it ends. If I\u2019ve hurt people\u2019s feelings then I\u2019m truly sorry and hope they will forgive me.\u201d", "Later, Augusta National\u2019s social media team released another version of the footage in which Player\u2019s box of balls seemed to have been cropped out of the main shot, which made it a freshly pressed bit of Augusta history, laundered till it looked just so. Which fits. Augusta, which is built on the site of an antebellum fruit plantation, has smoothed over some of its own history. So has Player.", "In the press conference he, Elder and Nicklaus gave later that morning, he told the story of the time he invited Elder over to South Africa to play in the South African PGA. \u201cIn 1969 I think it was.\u201d He was two years out, but, as he said: \u201cAs we get older we don\u2019t remember all the intricacies and details.\u201d Intricacies and details like the remarks he made in his 1966 book Grand Slam Golf, in which he spoke about his proud support for the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd.", "Gary Player with Lee Elder at Augusta. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters", "The story of Elder\u2019s trip is worth telling. He and his wife, Rose, travelled across Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, playing tournaments, giving lectures, clinics and demonstrations at universities and schools. Elder donated all his winnings to local charities, and insisted that he would only play in South Africa if they agreed to allow black fans in to watch.", "According to Player, he had to personally persuade the then South African president, John Vorster, to let Elder come, and he did it at some cost. \u201cI was called a traitor.\u201dIt\u2019s true he was criticised by people on both sides of the apartheid debate, and even faced death threats. But in this telling, he comes across as a man on a crusade against apartheid. On Thursday he even described Elder\u2019s presence on the 1st tee at Augusta that morning as \u201ca historic moment for me\u201d because \u201cLee Elder experienced a lot of things that I also experienced in my life\u201d. The black knight playing white knight.", "Others remember it differently. Vorster\u2019s decision to allow Elder to come coincided with a new policy of allowing black athletes to compete in \u201cmultinational\u201d sports contests in an attempt to get around the international boycotts. Player was a proud and outspoken advocate of Vorster\u2019s government before, during and after Elder\u2019s trip, some even claim he was a propagandist for the regime. In a New York Times interview in 1975, Player said: \u201cGreat changes are taking place here, I definitely feel there is more love between black and whites in South African than in any other country I\u2019ve seen.\u201d", "At that time Player was also working for the Committee for Fairness in Sport, a public relations organisation funded by the South African government to push back against the boycotts. He was also being paid by the South African government to play golf with US business executives in an attempt to persuade them not to withdraw their investments from the country.", "Which isn\u2019t to say Player deserves to be condemned. Nelson Mandela wrote: \u201cFew men in our country\u2019s history did as much to enact political changes for the better that eventually improved the lives of millions of his countrymen. Through his tremendous influence as a great athlete Mr. Player accomplished what many politicians could not.\u201d", "He has spoken himself about how \u201cI\u2019ve said things I regret, have changed my opinion about things.\u201d Only that an honest account of his history, of his sport\u2019s history, wouldn\u2019t read quite so smooth, or straightforward, or polished, as he makes it sound."], "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "keywords": ["black", "african", "history", "golf", "smooth", "retelling", "quite", "players", "augusta", "elder", "south", "play", "player", "gary", "elders", "apartheid"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
