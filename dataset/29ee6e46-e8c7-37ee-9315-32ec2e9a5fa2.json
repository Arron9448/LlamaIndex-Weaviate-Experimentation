From multi-floored museum-like arenas to lush forests with abandoned structures, Atomic Heart looks to offer blood-pumping action sequences within flashy, bombastic setpieces.", "Mundfish\u2019s upcoming open-world RPG is set in an alternate reality where the USSR has made substantial technological advancements that push it decades ahead of any other world power. You play as a special KGB agent named P-3. Armed with a robust selection of firearms and melee weapons, you\u2019ll traverse the various environments to unearth the secrets behind the Soviet Union\u2019s creations while fighting off a bevy of the wild experiments that roam the land.", "The adversaries shown vary from cyborgs (they\u2019re like an interesting cross between the ones in I, Robot and Alien: Isolation) to powerful monsters. There\u2019s that terrifying beast that emerges from a hole in the ground that P-3 fights at the 5:25 mark, and the sauntering bear-man-thing with the bloody head at the 8:32 mark is the stuff of literal nightmares. Gameplay-wise, Atomic Heart reminds me of the first Bioshock game.", "After watching the compilation multiple times, I still can\u2019t tell you exactly what the narrative is all about outside of what has already been provided. And Mundfish\u2019s clips do a good job of setting up an incredibly odd atmosphere and tone without giving away too many details. I can say that much of what I\u2019ve seen looks downright terrifying and definitely not for the faint of heart.", "A release date for Atomic Heart hasn\u2019t been announced but it will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC."], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "Jay Is A Jrpg Enthusiast", "Having Clocked In Thousands Of Hours In Franchises Like Final Fantasy", "Monster Hunter.
