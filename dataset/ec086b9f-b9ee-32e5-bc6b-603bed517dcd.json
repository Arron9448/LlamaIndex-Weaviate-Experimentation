After rising at 4 a.m. and coanchoring Weekend Today in New York, the White House correspondent darted into a car and began racing back to her post at Biden campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. Welker knew Pennsylvania would be called imminently, and she risked missing her historic live shot if she was stuck at a gas station in New Jersey when the race was decided.", "\u201cIt was out of a movie,\u201d Welker, 44, said of arriving at Wilmington\u2019s Chase Center at the final hour. (Her producer later scored a TikTok video of her dashing onto the set to the Rocky theme.) \u201cI made it in time to get a sip of water, hear the special report start to gear up, and we were on.\u201d", "One hundred and twenty miles north at 30 Rock, and in Welker\u2019s earpiece, Savannah Guthrie officially projected Biden to win the presidency. The Today coanchor had been on-air for more than 29 hours since Election Day. (Guthrie\u2019s husband, communications consultant Michael Feldman, who had been looking after their six-year-old daughter, Vale, and four-year-old son, Charley, sent supplemental clothes and contact lenses.) She had steered the network through a series of unprecedented events\u2014like President Trump\u2019s 2 a.m. speech on Wednesday baselessly claiming victory. During that speech, Guthrie had to cut in to inform viewers that several of his statements were, frankly, not true.", "\u201cIt gives me and it gives our network no pleasure to interrupt the president of the United States,\u201d Guthrie, 49, told me about a week after the election, at an outdoor caf\u00e9 near her Tribeca apartment, an ever-present Starbucks cup close at hand. But letting lies stand on national television would not have been acceptable: \u201cA politician\u2019s spin is expected. A false statement is not. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d", "In a season of political tumult, amid an increasingly polarized and partisan media landscape, Guthrie and Welker have emerged as pillars of the fourth estate\u2014two roundly tough-but-fair network newswomen determined to hold leaders of both parties to account. For viewers raised on voice-of-God, elder-statesman anchors, they are redefining who occupies the seats of power in television media. Against the backdrop of the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on the free press, Guthrie and Welker delivered two of the more improbable journalistic feats of the 2020 election cycle: Guthrie\u2019s interview with President Trump at NBC\u2019s controversial town hall in Miami in October and, one week later, Welker\u2019s moderation of the final presidential debate. \u201cThey prepare like no other people that I\u2019ve met in this profession,\u201d said their colleague NBC News chief foreign-affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely self-confident on camera\u2014unshakable, despite the pressure.\u201d"], "authors": ["Michelle Ruiz", "Michelle Rui"], "keywords": ["2020", "welkers", "savannah", "viewers", "week", "won", "network", "welker", "president", "kristen", "coverage", "biden", "guthrie", "election", "trump"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
