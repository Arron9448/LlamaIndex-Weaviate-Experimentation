It can be hard to get your mind around it. One way to try is to note that, right now, more than a hundred thousand Americans are in the hospital with COVID-19\u2014which is roughly as many people as can fit into the country\u2019s biggest stadiums for the Super Bowl, and nearly twice as many as were hospitalized during the pandemic\u2019s worst days in April and July. Another is to note that, around the U.S., hospitals are running out of nurses and doctors. At least half of all states are now facing staff shortages, and more than a third of hospitals in states as varied as Arkansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Wisconsin are simply running out of staff. Ordinarily, an I.C.U. nurse might care for, at most, two critically ill patients at a time. Now, some are caring for as many as eight patients simultaneously. Recently, North Dakota\u2019s governor issued an order allowing asymptomatic but coronavirus-positive health-care workers to continue seeing patients. (People without symptoms can still be infectious.) In most of California, I.C.U. usage now exceeds eighty-five per cent\u2014the threshold above which new stay-at-home restrictions kick in. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the nation\u2019s hospitals have developed protocols and purchased ventilators, and the mortality rate has fallen. But now the spread of the virus is so extreme that a shortfall of clinicians is becoming an insurmountable barrier in the fight against COVID-19.", "Alexi Nazem is the co-founder and C.E.O. of Nomad Health, a medical-staffing company based in New York City. Nomad fills physician and nursing needs across the U.S.; it sends nurses, in particular, to hospitals big and small, urban and rural, from coast to coast. Nazem has marked the evolution of the pandemic by the scale of the job orders he\u2019s received, which have shifted, more or less, with the seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable roller coaster,\u201d he told me recently. In the spring, it was a \u201cfive-alarm fire.\u201d There were unprecedented needs in New York and other early epicenters, but hospitals around the country felt compelled to staff up, too. \u201cNo one had ever experienced anything like it,\u201d he said. \u201cHospitals looked around and saw that the COVID light switch could flip overnight. They thought the same thing would happen to them. There was an explosion of job orders from all over.\u201d For the most part, though, COVID-19 patients didn\u2019t materialize; many hospitals, having postponed elective procedures and non-urgent visits, sat empty and ended up cancelling their staffing requests. \u201cIt was complete whiplash,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Actually, we don\u2019t need all these extra people. We can\u2019t even afford to pay our regular staff.\u2019 \u201d", "In the summer, when the coronavirus surged across the Sun Belt\u2014in Florida, Texas, Arizona\u2014Nazem\u2019s company sent clinicians to affected states. But hospitals elsewhere didn\u2019t feel the need to bolster COVID-19 staffing. \u201cHospitals were more experienced by then,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t over-ordering.\u201d The composition of new job requests also shifted. Many hospitals were staffing not for coronavirus wards but to help in operating rooms and procedural suites that had postponed cases and were now running overtime to work through huge backlogs of colonoscopies and knee replacements. \u201cThese specialties were the worst hit in the spring,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cThey were among the hottest in the summer.\u201d", "Now the need for clinicians has erupted again. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cOrders are coming from everywhere. There are no hot spots. It\u2019s crazier than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d In the past, Nomad Health has provided hospitals with nurses who will work specifically on COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s now impossible to distinguish by job,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cHospitals are saying, \u2018Just come. Who knows what we\u2019ll need you for.\u2019 \u201d Given the current wave\u2019s persistence, hospitals are renewing contracts for travelling nurses at unprecedented rates, effectively taking them out of circulation. \u201cThe number of extension requests tripled from summer to fall,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cThe market is getting tighter and tighter. Hospitals are saying, \u2018Let me hold on to whatever I can.\u2019 \u201d In the past, they were picky about whom they would hire. \u201cThey used to say, \u2018We need the perfect person,\u2019 \u201d Nazem told me. \u201cNow they say, \u2018If you find someone, anyone, send them over.\u2019 \u201d (Nomad Health thoroughly reviews credentials for each clinician; Nazem was at pains to say that quality has not been compromised.)", "In normal times, there are some fifty thousand travelling nurses in the United States. Most are full-time gig workers who move from job to job, usually staying in one place for thirteen weeks. (That length is a holdover from old maternity-leave policies for nurses; the staffing industry evolved, in part, to fill such gaps.) According to Nazem, travelling nurses generally fit two profiles. One group consists of early-career nurses who want to acquire a range of clinical experiences\u2014academic, urban, rural\u2014and to travel the country. Another includes nurses at the end of their careers: \u201cThey say, \u2018Hey, the kids are out of the house. I\u2019d like to make some extra money. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to go to Alaska for the summer?\u2019 \u201d The pandemic has diversified the pool. Severe staff shortages have brought more nurses into the travelling workforce. Many clinicians, especially those with critical-care training, feel an obligation to help. But, because demand has far outpaced supply, pay for travelling nurses has also skyrocketed. \u201cTraditional nurses look around and say, \u2018Hey, that travelling nurse is making double what I am,\u2019 \u201d Nazem said. Before the pandemic, hospitals might have offered a travelling nurse seventy-five dollars an hour; now, in many places, that rate has tripled. \u201cHigh pay draws more supply into the market,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cBut at some point you reach a limit. Even if you were willing to pay a thousand dollars an hour, there just aren\u2019t enough nurses. All you\u2019re doing then is shuffling people around. You\u2019re robbing Peter to pay Paul. We\u2019re dangerously close to that.\u201d", "Editor\u2019s Picks", "Gary Solesbee has an understated manner and an easy Texas drawl; he has been a nurse for twenty-seven years. Last year, he and his wife, who is also a nurse, decided to travel. It would be a chance to explore the country and to spend time with their adult children, who were scattered in different states. In December, they started an assignment in Webster, Texas. In March, they left for Walla Walla, Washington, where their son lives, and where, shortly after they arrived, coronavirus patients began to trickle in. Over the summer, when cases exploded in the Southwest, they signed on with an academic hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \u201cWhen we started travel-nursing, we had no idea we\u2019d be doing COVID nursing,\u201d Solesbee told me. \u201cBut that\u2019s pretty much what it\u2019s become.\u201d Solesbee, who now works in a step-down unit\u2014the rung between a regular medical floor and the I.C.U.\u2014is one of several hundred travelling nurses his current hospital system, in Albuquerque, has hired to contend with the surge. Solesbee\u2019s hospital, like many around the country, has had to refashion many floors into COVID-19 units. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to go to an orthopedics floor and see it transformed for COVID care,\u201d Solesbee said. \u201cThen you go to gynecology, it\u2019s half COVID. Outpatient services, all COVID. Everywhere\u2014it\u2019s COVID, COVID, COVID.\u201d Last month, the New Mexico health department opened another hospital nearby to house recovering coronavirus patients who had no place to go.", "I asked Solesbee if he saw any signs of cases abating. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s picking up, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re bracing for a surge on top of a surge during the holidays.\u201d In recent weeks, he has been asked to pick up additional shifts as the need for nursing care has grown further. Each shift lasts twelve hours, sometimes more. \u201cYou get very fatigued,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients are incredibly sick. You\u2019re on your feet all day, going in and out of rooms, putting on, taking off P.P.E. When I get home, I take my scrubs off and collapse. It\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve experienced before.\u201d Still, he agreed to the extra shifts, mostly out of a sense of duty. He\u2019s decided to stay on through the winter.", "\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening that much of the public still isn\u2019t taking this seriously,\u201d Solesbee said. \u201cI want to tell them, \u2018Come to work with me one day. See what it\u2019s like.\u2019 \u201d Caring for coronavirus patients is exhausting, but it\u2019s their intense isolation, not clinical complexity, that bothers Solesbee most. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t have family or visitors come in. We\u2019re the only contact they have, and we can\u2019t be with them as much as usual. We\u2019re supposed to bundle care, limit exposure, do what you need to do and get out.\u201d Still, there are moments when compassion trumps protocol. Recently, an elderly patient\u2019s blood-oxygen levels dipped to dangerous levels despite maximum support. After declining a ventilator, he prepared to die. A nurse sat in the room with the patient, calling each of his family members on FaceTime, one by one, so they could said their goodbyes. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s the only thing we can do for people,\u201d Solesbee told me. \u201cBut, in some ways, it\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d The other night, Solesbee sat with a dying man who had no family. With no one to call, he simply held the man\u2019s hand as the patient\u2019s breathing grew ragged and intermittent. Finally, it stopped. Solesbee stood up. Another patient needed his help.", "Terri Newland is a critical-care nurse from Greenville, North Carolina, but has been on the road for much of the past two years: Mesa, Arizona; the Chesapeake Bay; Charlottesville, Virginia. In January, she started work at a twenty-five-bed critical-access hospital in Berlin, Wisconsin, a town of some six thousand people about twenty-five miles from Lake Winnebago. In the spring, as the coronavirus started to spread, the hospital delayed elective procedures and sent staff to larger hospitals to gain extra critical-care training. Soon, patients started presenting with cough, fever, and trouble breathing. At that time, Newland\u2019s hospital sent its coronavirus swabs to an external lab; it took up to three days for the results to return. \u201cIn the meantime, we wore full protective gear with anyone who might have COVID while we waited for their test to come back,\u201d Newland said. \u201cIt was very disorienting for older patients. They can\u2019t see your face. They can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying. They needed human contact, and we couldn\u2019t give that to them.\u201d Newland recalled a patient in her seventies whose room overlooked the parking lot. Each evening, the woman\u2019s family would gather outside the window, call her phone, and mime through the glass. One evening, Newland walked in during the ritual. She helped the woman take a selfie with her family. \u201cI still cherish that photo,\u201d she said. She intended to leave when her contract ended in May, but by then the pandemic had deepened such that she felt uncomfortable travelling. \u201cI was stuck,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right getting on a plane and flying home.\u201d So she stayed.", "In August, Newland took a job in an I.C.U. in Greensboro, North Carolina, about two hours from home. The local health system has tried to restrict COVID-19 care to a single hospital to prevent the coronavirus from spreading because of medical care. Newland works mostly in a \u201cclean\u201d hospital but is sometimes asked to help in the COVID-19 hospital, which is staffed primarily by travelling nurses. The sense of camaraderie there is palpable. \u201cThe pandemic has really pulled us together,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is doing what they have to do. We try to help each other because we know what it\u2019s like when things get crazy.\u201d Newland, who works night shifts, also makes it a point to serve as a conduit for patients\u2019 families. \u201cI want them to know that just because they can\u2019t come in doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve forgotten them,\u201d she said. \u201cI give them my number and say, \u2018If you wake up at 3 A.M. and want to know what\u2019s going on, call me. I will talk you through this.\u2019 \u201d", "Some staffing companies offer housing, or make referrals to agencies that help travellers secure accommodations. Newland prefers to do her own thing. She\u2019s currently staying in a trailer at a campground near her hospital; in Wisconsin, she rented space in a basement, which she found through a travelling-nurse Facebook group. Many nurses she knows stay in hotels, but, \u201cpersonally, I need more of a home feel,\u201d she told me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine staying in a hotel for months on end. Work can be hard; it\u2019s nice to have some space to relax and enjoy the days off.\u201d She likes the travel, but worries about what will happen as more nurses choose to hit the road. Desperate hospitals are offering high-paying contracts to lure nurses into the travelling workforce. \u201cI think a lot of nurses will end up paying for it with their mental and physical well-being,\u201d Newland said. There is also, of course, the unavoidable distribution problem. \u201cI\u2019m seeing lots of core staff leaving for travel gigs. And I wonder, are we filling some holes by opening up others?\u201d", "As a clinician, there is perhaps nothing more demoralizing than the sense that you\u2019re providing substandard care. That feeling, however vague, nags at the core of your professionalism, until it ruptures into what the writer Diane Silver has called \u201cmoral injury\u201d\u2014\u201ca deep soul wound that pierces a person\u2019s identity, sense of morality, and relationship to society.\u201d The term was originally coined to describe trauma suffered by soldiers at war, but it\u2019s since been adapted for the struggles of health-care workers contending with a system that often hinders their ability to do what\u2019s right for patients. It\u2019s an outcome that becomes unavoidable when, as now, the flood of patients far outstrips the capacity of people to care for them. Despite the best efforts of the most dedicated clinicians, medical care grows disorganized. You start to miss things. Often the overlooked things are insignificant\u2014a delayed dose of stool softener, for example\u2014but sometimes they\u2019re lethal: an undiagnosed blood clot, or a patient who, on his way to the bathroom, removes his oxygen mask, collapses, and is found dead forty-five minutes later.", "In the spring, disparities in COVID-19 deaths arising from inadequate staffing levels were among the ugliest aspects of the pandemic\u2019s first wave. At some overwhelmed hospitals during New York\u2019s surge, the patient-to-nurse ratio quadrupled in I.C.U.s; on the coronavirus floors, some nurses cared for as many as twenty patients at a time. The COVID-19 death rate at poorly resourced hospitals was two, even three, times that of well-resourced ones, owing partly to gross inequities in staffing. This is to say nothing of the suffering not captured by statistics: patients isolated, lonely, disoriented; families going without updates on their loved ones; health-care workers who reach the brink of burnout, then cross over. We\u2019re now approaching, and in some places passing, the threshold at which patients, families, and clinicians suffer the preventable consequences of a health-care system beyond its limits.", "There\u2019s always been a need for staffing companies like Nomad Health, but the pandemic has pushed them into a more central role. The government has been able to mobilize some medical personnel, but the vast majority of emergency pandemic staffing has been organized by companies like Nomad. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve been training for the Olympics, and they\u2019re finally here,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing all this in the background for years. We were practicing archery when no one was watching. Now it\u2019s the Olympics, and all of a sudden archery is really important.\u201d Before the pandemic, few staffing agencies saw themselves as so directly in the business of saving lives. Now the crisis has elevated their work. \u201cIt feels different now,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking so much of our staff\u2014long hours, complex work. But I think they truly feel that when they work hard, it makes a difference in people\u2019s lives. We\u2019re getting clinicians to the bedside, and, as a result, patients are getting the care they need.\u201d", "For now. There will come a point\u2014likely soon\u2014when supply won\u2019t meet the demand. The infection curve will overwhelm the most efficient planning, the most creative C.E.O.s, and the most committed clinicians. Murky as it may be, there is, in fact, an upper bound, defined by the ruthless logic of biology and math. \u201cIf and when we hit the limit depends entirely on our national public-health response,\u201d Nazem said. \u201cBut people should know: there is a hard limit. Every day that something doesn\u2019t change, we get closer to it.\u201d", "More Medical Dispatches"], "authors": ["Dhruv Khullar", "Dhruv Khulla", "Amy Davidson Sorki", "Carolyn Korman"], "keywords": ["nazem", "hospital", "staffing", "running", "america", "patients", "solesbee", "travelling", "care", "nurses", "hospitals", "pandemic"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
