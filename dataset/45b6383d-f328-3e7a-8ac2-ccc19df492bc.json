There are multiple strains of norovirus, so you can catch it more than once in a season \u2014 and it\u2019s basically hanging around all winter, from November to April.", "Norovirus can live on surfaces for days and, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people infected with norovirus shed billions of virus particles for two weeks or more; just a few particles can make other people sick. That\u2019s why norovirus outbreaks have caused an elementary school in Seattle and 40 schools in Colorado to close briefly in recent weeks \u2014 officials wanted to stop the spread, and keeping sick kids away from each other and the building can help.", "So how do you prevent the dark lord norovirus from destroying your home and everything you hold dear?", "Clean with bleach. The cleaning tips in this piece from frequent NYT Parenting contributor Melinda Wenner Moyer come expert approved. They include using health care-grade bleach wipes to clean if someone in your family gets sick (regular Clorox and Lysol disinfecting wipes do not kill norovirus), and cleaning the bathroom every time a person gets sick in it. \u201cThis means cleaning the toilet, the handle, the sink, the doorknob \u2014 anything that a sick person or his or her fluids might have touched,\u201d Melinda wrote. \u201cClose the toilet lid before every flush, too, and maybe even flush a second time after pouring in a half cup to a cup of bleach.\u201d", "If there is an active infection going around, Dr. Gail Shust, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at N.Y.U. Langone Health, suggested making sure that day cares and preschools where your kids are enrolled are cleaning their toys with bleach-based products.", "Practice extreme hygiene. Tell your kids to \u201csing the alphabet when they\u2019re washing their hands,\u201d said Dr. Tracey Allyson Wilkinson, M.D., M.P.H, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, because just splashing some water around won\u2019t cut it. Most common hand sanitizers don\u2019t kill norovirus either \u2014 thorough hand washing is the best way.", "If you know norovirus is going around your child\u2019s school, Dr. Wilkinson suggested having your kid change out of his clothes the second he gets home from school, and leaving the soiled clothing along with his backpack and anything else that\u2019s been at school at your front door. Because norovirus can live on surfaces, you don\u2019t want those clothes contaminating your living space.", "Once infected, quarantine the sick person. \u201cIf you can quasi-quarantine yourself, active infection shouldn\u2019t last much longer than 48 hours,\u201d Dr. Shust said. For caregivers, even after that 48-hour period, you don\u2019t want to be preparing food for anyone for a while, as you can still shed the virus. If you are a single parent and absolutely must prepare food, really scrub your hands when you wash \u2014 you want \u201cfriction and suds,\u201d Dr. Shust said.", "For sick kids, try these tips. \u201cPut a glow stick in the trash,\u201d Dr. Wilkinson suggested, because if your kids need to vomit in the middle of the night, they will know where to direct it. She also recommended putting multiple trash bags in a designated barf bucket, so that once a kid has thrown up, you can remove the soiled bag and still have other bags ready to go. For toddlers and babies too young to direct their emissions, you may just have to hang out in the bathtub with them for a while and wait for the worst to pass.", "Stave off dehydration. \u201cAfter you vomit you should wait an hour before you try something on your stomach, and something small can be ice chips or a Pedialyte popsicle,\u201d Dr. Wilkinson said \u2014 the ice helps water drip back into your system more gently than chugging water does. If your child is showing signs of dehydration \u2014 \u201ccrying without tears, mouth looks really dry, excessively tired,\u201d explained Dr. Shust, you should call your pediatrician.", "If at all possible, you should try to avoid a trip to the E.R., Dr. Wilkinson said. \u201cFrom a public health perspective, I\u2019d love for people who are contagious not to be in an E.R. You might pick up another illness in the waiting room that you will then have a couple days later,\u201d she said. Your pediatrician can call in anti-nausea medication or help you triage over the phone, Dr. Wilkinson explained, so that should be your first choice unless things seem really dire. \u201cYou know your child best,\u201d she said.", "P.S.
