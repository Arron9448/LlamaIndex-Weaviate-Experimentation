And, even without EU financial support, new plants are in the works, many in southern and eastern European countries that have historically incinerated less than long-standing waste-to-energy proponents such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian nations. Meanwhile, across the English Channel, post-Brexit Britain is charging ahead with proposals for dozens of new garbage-burning projects.", "Without a more decisive change of course, critics argue, that adds up to an existential threat both to Europe\u2019s promise to slash carbon emissions to net-zero by midcentury and its dreams of a \u201ccircular economy\u201d in which reuse and recycling largely take the place of waste disposal.", "\u201cBurning plastic in a climate emergency, that\u2019s insane,\u201d said Georgia Elliott-Smith, an environmental engineer and Extinction Rebellion activist who is suing the British government over its decision to exclude incinerators from its new emissions trading system. Plastic, hard to recycle and ubiquitous in garbage, is made from fossil fuel derivatives and emits carbon dioxide when burned, accounting for a substantial chunk of incineration\u2019s climate damage.", "In a case scheduled to be heard in the High Court this month, Elliott-Smith contends Britain violated its Paris Agreement commitments by omitting the waste-to-energy sector from the market it created when it left the European greenhouse gas emissions trading system as part of its divorce from the E.U. While she also argues the new system is too weak to shrink Britain\u2019s carbon footprint, including incinerators could, in principle, put a cost on their emissions.", "Sinking billions of pounds into new incinerators now could lock Britain into decades of garbage-burning and make it harder for cash-strapped local authorities to boost recycling and composting rates, she said. The country already burns nearly 45 percent of its waste\u2014more than it recycles, the Channel 4 show Dispatches recently reported. \u201cThe way incineration works, it skews the economics of waste by its very existence,\u201d Elliott-Smith said. \u201cOnce you build the beast, you\u2019ve got to keep feeding it.\u201d", "Worries that incinerators sicken those who live near them\u2014disproportionately poor, and people of color\u2014have long dogged the industry. Wealthy nations such as Sweden and Denmark, which rely heavily on waste-to-energy plants, say their sophisticated emissions treatment systems mean such concerns are misplaced. But critics note many nations lack the resources for the best pollution-control systems. Dangerous emissions such as dioxin and particulate matter sometimes go unreported, and enforcement is often porous, environmentalists say."], "authors": ["Beth Gardiner", "Beth Gardine"], "keywords": ["emissions", "incinerators", "system", "nations", "heats", "european", "waste", "garbage", "recycling", "wastetoenergy", "backlash", "eu", "europe", "carbon"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
