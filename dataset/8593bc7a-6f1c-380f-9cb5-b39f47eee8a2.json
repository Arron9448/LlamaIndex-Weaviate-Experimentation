You\u2019re committing to a fashion statement on your head, in the direct eye line of people\u2019s judgmental gazes. Okay, that\u2019s dramatic, but still\u2014it\u2019s just asking for people to look at you! It\u2019s only fitting, however, that a trendsetter like Katie Holmes would be daring enough to start out 2021 wearing one. Yesterday, the actor was spotted running some errands in New York City wearing not any ol\u2019 hat, but a baker boy cap. The retro style looks like a baseball cap, only the top is more puffy and mushroom-like, and dominated in the early 2000s.", "Let\u2019s rewind to the Y2K era, shall we? Life was simple and good: Britney Spears was topping the charts, and the pop star was also hitting the red carpet in pink baker boy caps. Fellow superstars like Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera were also rocking the dramatic style with their best bootcut jeans and halter tops. It was the hat to wear in Hollywood. But, like any other fashion craze, the appeal of the baker boy cap fizzled out\u2014until now.", "Britney Spears in 2002 Photo: Getty Images", "Holmes made a convincing case for the hat by choosing a smarter, more grown-up version. Hers was in black, and the shape was decidedly more structured, too. Her outfit also gave it a current feel. Holmes styled it with a black blazer and turtleneck, classic blue jeans, and sleek Aera vegan leather boots. On the whole, the fit was simple and classic, but the hat gave it a more fashiony feel. It goes to show that, when done right, a good hat can instantly make an outfit. Who doesn\u2019t love a lazy style hack?", "Jennifer Lopez in 2002 Photo: Getty Images"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["wearing", "boy", "hat", "cap", "spears", "holmes", "outfit", "simple", "baker", "katie", "style", "lopez", "revives"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
