Few can say they\u2019ve walked the catwalk at London Fashion Week for 16 Arlington, as she did in 2020, thrifted their way through Brooklyn\u2019s vintage emporiums, and crafted characters whose taste in clothing is as memorable as their dialogue. Dunham\u2019s path from lifelong enthusiast to Vogue cover star is well documented, but until recently, her interest was limited to personal style. This week's launch of 11 Honor\u00e9 x Lena Dunham changes all that with a five-piece collection that fulfills her wardrobe wishlist.", "Like many of her previous projects, the capsule began with a character. \u201cI had this early 90s SoHo woman in mind bopping through her day from one appointment to the next,\u201d shared Dunham on the phone from London where she\u2019s filming the comedy, Catherine, Called Birdy. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s heading to the farmers market or having dinner with friends and has to stop by her studio. Imagining her day unwinding was huge for me, because then you can feel it all come to life.\u201d", "The character focus is evident within the collection. Offered in sizes 12 to 26, the lineup of scalloped-edged pinstripe blazers and patterned shirt dresses in shades of olive and marigold would look right at home on the big screen. Girls fans might picture Shoshanna or Jessa, but the looks also align with Dunham\u2019s modern magpie aesthetic. \u201cI\u2019ve always been about color and pattern\u2014the louder, the better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it looks like Auntie Mame wearing a pair of PJs and knocking back champagne or [as though] a kindergartener hot glued on a bunch of fake rhinestones, that\u2019s where my style lives.\u201d Such eclecticism is still rare within the plus-size luxury market, a space where Dunham felt there was room for improvement.", "Photo: Courtesy of 11 Honor\u00e9", "The capsule itself grew out of Dunham\u2019s friendship with 11 Honor\u00e9 founder Patrick Herning. First introduced to the site as a customer, Dunham found the size-inclusive e-tailer to be an oasis of good taste. After months of buying her Rachel Comey separates and GANNI dresses on the site, she met Herning in the fall of 2019. The pair hit it off immediately. After some back and forth\u2014and the onset of the global pandemic\u2014both felt a clothing collection informed by Dunham\u2019s experiences would be ideal. \u201cLena was so open about her journey, which had a profound impact on what she wanted to develop,\u201d says Herning. \u201cThere is just this authenticity. From the print style to buttons and edges, it all feels very her.\u201d", "Like many women, Dunham experienced weight fluctuations over time and saw the difference in the options available for straight-size consumers versus what was offered to their plus-sized peers. \u201cI\u2019ve always been someone who\u2019s had a curvy body, and the market was something that truly interested me [as] I was starting to see a lot of the holes within it,\u201d she explains. \u201c11 Honor\u00e9 already filled some of those, and it was great to find pieces there that I loved and spoke to my tastes. I\u2019m someone who loves to feel powerful in my clothes and likes them to have a sense of humor, so I thought there might be a world where I have something to say [in fashion] and about creating plus-size garments. When I started talking to Patrick, I realized that he would be the perfect guide.\u201d", "Dunham\u2019s perspective on dressing can be aptly summed up in one world: cheeky. There is a playfulness to her clothing choices, whether it\u2019s pure irreverence like the coordinating Christopher Kane mini-dresses she and Girls co-star Jemima Kirke wore at the 2019 Camp-themed Met Gala or punchy floral Prada she graced the Emmys carpet back in 2013. But her love of whimsy was often at odds with much of what she found when pursuing stores. \u201cSometimes it seems that the people who make plus size clothing think that women want to disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cThat because our bodies are curvy, we don\u2019t want to be seen any longer, and that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Those attitudes were something Dunham sought to counter within her designs. Bold, upbeat, and filled with detail, her pieces aren\u2019t for wallflowers. \u201cI wanted these clothes to say something and have a perspective,\u201d says Dunham. \u201cThey aren\u2019t trying to hide because the people who are wearing them have historically been told that they should hide.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of 11 Honor\u00e9", "To get that point across, Dunham approached the design process with an eye towards personality. Thinking back to her childhood in Manhattan, she filled her mood board with figures who populated red carpets and party pages during her youth, along with a little familial inspiration. \u201c[I had] a lot of photographs of my mom in the early nineties,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cThen why not add some Jane Birkin pictures or Winona Ryder because she\u2019s everything, Naomi Campbell in this amazing power suiting. Inspirational women and then some great pictures, textural elements, and quintessential New York photos [of] those fire escapes between Broadway and Prince where I grew up.\u201d", "The muses were retro, and so were the reference points. \u201cI have always loved vintage shopping, in person or just trawling through Etsy for hours searching for pieces,\u201d says Dunham. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find vintage pieces because a lot of those things were never even made in larger sizes. Bringing that vintage feel to the pieces was incredibly important to me. I wanted each design to have a thoughtful detail that sets it apart and gives you that cheekiness or edge.\u201d Dunham\u2019s father, artist Carroll Dunham, even designed a print for the collection. The geometric shapes that feature on the asymmetrically hemmed Madderlake dress look fit for a gallery wall, precisely Dunham\u2019s intent. \u201cIt was all about taking things beyond basic,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the scalloped edges on the blazer for a touch of femininity, a white shirt with a mock turtleneck, so it isn\u2019t just the standard. Even the pearlescent buttons on the menswear shirt, which we\u2019ve done in a yellow fabrication for a seventies, feel takes it a step further.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of 11 Honor\u00e9", "Herning and 11 Honor\u00e9 designer, Danielle Williams Eke, were on hand to ensure that Dunham\u2019s ideas translated into wearable pieces. Learning the ins and outs of taking a concept from sketch to final product was eye-opening for the star. \u201cI learned so much from Patrick and Danielle about fit and the process of fit, what you need to do to make a dress work in reality,\u201d says Dunham. \u201cThey don\u2019t just go \u2018we\u2019ll add more fabric to a basic size\u2019 they are thinking about the topography of the body and how a woman will feel wearing these clothes. Danielle is an absolute genius, and I loved seeing the care that went into this.\u201d", "Fashion\u2019s relationship with larger sizes remains fraught. Still, thanks to the efforts of brands like 11 Honor\u00e9, Universal Standard, Good American, and many others who have emerged as powerhouses online, the concept of size inclusivity is moving into the industry\u2019s mainstream. But finding stylish clothing can still be an uphill battle, even for those in the limelight. And Dunham has experienced firsthand how problematic the media\u2019s treatment of women\u2019s bodies still is. \u201cI\u2019ve been the butt of a fair number of jokes because of the shape and size of my body; that\u2019s just the reality,\u201d she says. \u201cThose comments have come more from the media outside of fashion than within fashion itself. No, fashion is not an industry where curvy bodies are embraced, but there have been plenty of people within the industry who have viewed me as someone they might want to dress, which has been an enlightening experience.\u201d", "The benefit of those experiences is now Dunham can bring her insider\u2019s view to a wider audience, one that is continuously evolving. While she\u2019s aware that her personal history within fashion comes with a degree of privilege, Dunham hopes that collections like hers continue to broaden the range of options available until the playing field becomes genuinely level. \u201cI\u2019ve had some amazing experiences in fashion, but I still recognize that progress needs to be made,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the women who experience this collection and wear it feel as though [the pieces] were made just for them. There should be no tugging or pulling, no need for alteration. They can put these on and feel powerful.\u201d", "Deluca Skirt $138 11 Honor\u00e9 x Lena Dunham Shop Now The Ballroom Shirt $128 11 Honor\u00e9 x Lena Dunham Shop Now"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["sizeinclusive", "honor\u00e9", "lena", "11", "clothing", "feel", "introduces", "character", "dunhams", "dunham", "fashion", "pieces", "collection"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
