On Friday, three Democratic committee chairs jointly issued a subpoena to the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, demanding any State Department documents, which had been requested earlier in the month, \u201crelated to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the President\u2019s bid for reelection.\u201d Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he and his colleagues would be working on their Ukraine probe through the two-week congressional recess, which begins this weekend. \u201cThe fast action\u2014and discussions about resorting to a little-known congressional power to detain, arrest or fine recalcitrant witnesses\u2014suggests the House could vote on articles of impeachment as soon as late October,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported in its Saturday edition. \u201cThe Judiciary Committee, which is traditionally the epicenter of impeachment proceedings, would draft the articles.\u201d", "October starts on Tuesday, and getting to a House vote by the end of the month represents a very condensed timetable. It may prove unrealistic, but Democrats are determined to act while this past week\u2019s dramatic developments, including the release of a damning complaint filed by an intelligence whistle-blower, are fresh in the minds of voters. \u201cEverything is real time,\u201d Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat of Illinois and member of the Intelligence Committee, told the New York Times. \u201cYou don\u2019t sit back and contemplate the future when you are in the middle of it.\u201d", "In addition to issuing a subpoena for documents to Pompeo, the Democratic committee chairs have sent requests for depositions to a number of current and former officials at the State Department who were named in the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint or who work on U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe. They include Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, whom Trump talked about in disparaging terms during his July 25th conversation with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, who resigned from his post on Friday. Volker, a veteran diplomat who was trying to resolve the long-running dispute between the Ukrainian government and Russian separatists, could be a key witness for the congressional committees. He knows all the players in Ukraine, and he was reportedly the official who introduced Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a central actor in this story, to one of Zelensky\u2019s aides. According to the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, Volker also tried to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d caused by the unusual demands that Trump placed on Zelensky.", "As the Democrats look to keep the pressure on Trump, he and his conservative-media mouthpieces are engaged in a fierce but somewhat disorganized rearguard action, which involves denying that there was any quid pro quo with Zelensky concerning a Biden investigation and U.S. military aid to Ukraine; raising questions about the whistle-blower\u2019s motivations; accusing the Democrats of engaging in political theatre; and slamming the media. In a private address to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, on Thursday, Trump referred to reporters as \u201canimals\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d\u2014an alarming escalation in his rhetoric. Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, who is perhaps Trump\u2019s closest ally in the media, is also amping things up. On his show on Friday night, he called the Democrats \u201cdirtbags\u201d and said that they have \u201cdeclared war on a President of the United States.\u201d", "Behind its bluster, however, Team Trump appears to be struggling to come to terms with what has happened this week, and its ramifications for the President\u2019s 2020 re\u00eblection campaign. After interviewing more than a dozen sources in or close to the White House, Politico reported on Friday that the swiftness of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s action, in announcing a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, even before the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint had been released publicly, \u201ccaught the White House by surprise\u201d and left it struggling to come up with a response. For months, Trump had been assuming that impeachment would benefit him politically, the Politico piece said, but his \u201coptimistic, even nonchalant attitude melted away this week.\u201d By Saturday morning, before setting out for the golf course, he was reduced to lamenting the ruthlessness of the Democrats, writing on Twitter, \u201cCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time!\u201d", "Based on what has transpired during the past three years, and Trump\u2019s high approval rating among Republican voters, the most likely outcome of the impeachment process is that the G.O.P.-controlled Senate will acquit the President after the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach\u2014and there\u2019s even a possibility that Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader, won\u2019t allow a trial to take place at all. This explains why David Brooks, the Times columnist, and some other observers have argued that, in launching an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi has played into Trump\u2019s hands. But this reasoning assumes that the President will benefit from a public backlash against impeachment, as President Bill Clinton did, in the nineteen-nineties. This thinking might hold, but it\u2019s far from a sure thing. In a post earlier this week, I pointed out that the allegations contained in the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint are devastating for Trump, because they demonstrate in an easy-to-understand way how the President abused his office for personal gain; this impeachment won\u2019t be about a President\u2019s relationship with an intern. The admittedly limited polling that has been conducted on the question of impeachment following this week\u2019s revelations suggests that the Ukraine scandal is already having at least some impact on public opinion, including among self-identified independent voters, who are probably the only persuadable people at this point.", "According to a YouGov-HuffPost poll that was released on Thursday, Americans support impeachment by an eight-point margin. This was a jump, with most of it coming from more Democrats moving into the pro-impeachment column, but the number of independents who support impeachment also increased by a couple of points. An NPR-\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d-Marist survey that was released on Thursday found that forty-nine per cent of respondents supported impeachment, and forty-six per cent didn\u2019t. And a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Friday showed that forty-one per cent of independents now support impeachment, compared to thirty-eight per cent who oppose it.", "At this stage, such findings are only suggestive. It is hard to say how televised impeachment proceedings\u2014limited in duration and narrowly focussed on the Ukraine scandal and perhaps a couple of other Trump misdeeds, as some Democrats have proposed\u2014would play with the American public. One possible outcome that hasn\u2019t received much attention is that they wouldn\u2019t have much impact at all on the President\u2019s re\u00eblection prospects. Voters who detest Trump or support him will probably interpret the proceedings as supportive of their pre\u00ebxisting views. Less committed and less informed voters may write the hearings off as just another partisan battle in Washington.", "Why would anybody write off something as consequential as an impeachment? Perhaps because, as Politico\u2019s John Harris argued on Friday, impeachment isn\u2019t what it was\u2014and neither is the U.S. political culture. Americans are now so attuned to permanent political warfare and outrage that they tune out most of it, Harris argued. \u201cBack in the 1970s,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhen my mother and most Americans no matter their partisan affiliation were shocked by Nixon\u2019s lawbreaking, the presidency, Congress and the media all commanded majority or near-majority support when people were asked whether they had high \u2018confidence' in the institutions. These days, none of these institutions is even close to majority support, and only 11 percent of people say they have \u2018a great deal\u2019 or \u2018quite a lot\u2019 of confidence in Congress.\u201d The impeachment of Trump, Harris went on, \u201cmay be a solemn development\u2014but don\u2019t expect it to receive a lot of solemnity.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "62914ad1-f1c8-338b-b2d0-edd8f41e77e8", "keywords": ["president", "support", "strike", "ukraine", "impeachment", "presidents", "democrats", "whistleblowers", "house", "trump", "quickly", "looking", "voters", "inquiry"], "title": "The Democrats Are Looking to Strike Quickly in the Impeachment Inquiry", "summary": "But this reasoning assumes that the President will benefit from a public backlash against impeachment, as President Bill Clinton did, in the nineteen-nineties.\nAccording to a YouGov-HuffPost poll that was released on Thursday, Americans support impeachment by an eight-point margin.\nThis was a jump, with most of it coming from more Democrats moving into the pro-impeachment column, but the number of independents who support impeachment also increased by a couple of points.\nAnd a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Friday showed that forty-one per cent of independents now support impeachment, compared to thirty-eight per cent who oppose it.\nPerhaps because, as Politico\u2019s John Harris argued on Friday, impeachment isn\u2019t what it was\u2014and neither is the U.S. political culture.", "authors": ["John Cassidy", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Benjamin Wallace-Wells", "Steve Coll"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
