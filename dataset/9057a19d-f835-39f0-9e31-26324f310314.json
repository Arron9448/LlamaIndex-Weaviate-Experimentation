In this he draws on a long tradition of conservative populists recasting elite conspiracies in various iterations,\" the columnist later explained. \"As historian Michael Kazin\u2019s great book recounts, these have included communists subverting the government from within, bureaucrats engineering desegregation, secular elites plotting to undermine Christianity, Jewish elites selling out U.S. interests abroad, and so on.
