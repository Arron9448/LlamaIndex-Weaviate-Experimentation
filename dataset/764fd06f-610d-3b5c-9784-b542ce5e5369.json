Why not Congress?", "No Budget, No Pay is very simple bill I first introduced when I got to the Senate in 2019. It says that if Congress can\u2019t perform its most basic function \u2013 passing a budget \u2013 then members of the House and the Senate shouldn\u2019t get paid.", "Simple, right?", "NIKKI HALEY: BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS \u2013 HERE ARE LESSONS HE CAN LEARN FROM TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION EXAMPLE", "Apparently, that\u2019s too much to ask of Senate Democrats. A few week ago, as the Senate was debating the Democrats\u2019 massive $2 trillion spending bill, I proposed my No Budget, No Pay bill as an amendment. After all, Congress has spent $6 trillion over the last year to address the COVID crisis.", "Much (but not all) of that money was necessary to address this once-in-a-generation crisis and keep our economy afloat. But it also increased our national debt to more than $30 trillion and the best way to get a handle on federal spending is to return to a normal budgeting process \u2013 a process long ago jettisoned in Washington.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "Every single Senate Democrat voted against my amendment. They voted to continue to receive a taxpayer-funded paycheck even if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t perform the most basic function of government \u2013 pass a budget.", "It was shameful, but not surprising. The reality is, Washington sucks people in and turns them into mindless, partisan drones who vote to protect their power and position, rather than represent their constituents.", "Let me give you some examples.", "Mark Kelly was an astronaut and served our country in the Marines. He campaigned as an independent-minded, moderate Democrat who would go to Washington to shake things up and represent the best interests of Arizonans. Then he got to Washington and became just another yes vote for his party\u2019s leadership. He became part of the problem.", "Raphael Warnock is a pastor and a civil rights leader from Georgia. He campaigned on rising above the partisan bickering and politics as usual. He inspired tens of millions around the country by portraying himself as someone who would fight for everyday Americans in Washington. Then, he got to D.C. and voted with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to make sure he got a paycheck even if he doesn\u2019t do his job and work to pass a budget. He became part of the problem.", "All 50 Senate Democrats voted against No Budget, No Pay, including the 14 who are up for reelection in 2022.", "Maggie Hassan was a two-term governor of New Hampshire, a state that values its independence and can-do spirit. She was regarded as competent, moderate, hard-working and dedicated to New Hampshirites. Then she got to D.C. and forgot why the people of New Hampshire sent her there. She voted with the rest of Senate Democrats to continue receiving her $178,000 per year salary, even if the Senate can\u2019t pass a budget. She became part of the problem.", "Catherine Cortez Masto is a career politician and protege of former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., so it\u2019s not at all surprising that she votes with her party\u2019s leadership every time. I doubt they even have to ask. She\u2019s been part of the problem for a long time.", "Michael Bennet is a former schools superintendent who came to Washington promising to fight for children in Colorado. But since he got here, he\u2019s left the children of Colorado behind. He joined his Democrat colleagues in blocking Republican efforts to get schools reopened and voted against No Budget, No Pay \u2013 a measure intended to address the crippling debt that Congress is leaving to children in Colorado to pay off. He became part of the problem.", "All 50 Senate Democrats voted against No Budget, No Pay, including the 14 who are up for reelection in 2022. Besides the five listed above, the list includes Sens.

Many live paycheck to paycheck, even when our economy is strong. And many millions more have struggled to make ends meet during the COVID pandemic.", "It\u2019d a slap in the face to hardworking American families, who sit around the table every month and make careful budget decisions, to watch Washington Democrats vote against a common-sense measure to prevent members of Congress from getting paid if they can\u2019t pass a budget.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "Families do it.
