Technology, especially video calls, are a big help.", "\"I sometimes take a guitar with me on trips. You learn to adapt to it.

Several organizations that represent pilots, including the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations, the International Transport Workers' Federation and major US unions have urged governments to give flight crews priority access to vaccines.", "Myers doesn't want his colleagues at the back of the vaccine line, but he hopes they are not pressed into mandatory vaccinations either.
