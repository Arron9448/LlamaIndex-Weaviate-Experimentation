He was born in Miami in 1947. His father, who had roots in the Bahamas, worked as a butcher. His mother, whose family was from Georgia, raised their four children. They split up when Mackey was about three, and his mother moved with the kids to California, where they eventually settled in Santa Ana. Orange County was still lined with orange groves. \u201cEvery night, in bed, I would reflect on the farthest points north, east, south, and west I had gone in the course of that day,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt would not be very far. The farthest east I would have gone might be Bristol Street. The farthest south I would have gone would be McFadden Avenue. The farthest north would be First Street.\u201d", "Mackey was the youngest child, and the self-described \u201clittle egghead\u201d of the family. When he was in his early teens, his brother told him he might like jazz, because it was \u201cserious\u201d music. Mackey found a copy of Miles Davis\u2019s \u201cSketches of Spain,\u201d from 1960, whose brooding, fugitive spirit Mackey recognized underneath Davis\u2019s playful trumpet and Gil Evans\u2019s regal arrangements. He heard a \u201cdark knowledge,\u201d a melancholy undercurrent in Davis\u2019s horn passages. It was \u201cspeaking to something that was there in me,\u201d he said.", "Listening to Davis, Mackey began to notice esoteric systems of knowledge all around him. He bought a book of differential equations at the drugstore, simply because he was fond of math and imagined that these equations would grant him access to \u201ca kind of heaven,\u201d he said. He would stare at the book as if its pages were filled with holy art that he would one day understand.", "The more he listened to \u201cSketches of Spain,\u201d the more he heard. Over time, he imagined that the trumpet was a sorrowful bird. Sometimes, he heard it as the cry of an orphaned boy. Deep within the album\u2019s rhythms lurked hidden dances and rituals, fleeting traces of a suppressed Moorish culture, a secret history tying Spanish flamenco to African-American blues music. \u201cI may not have gone further west than Townsend Street, but I could listen to Miles and go to Spain,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was seeking out a larger world.\u201d", "It\u2019s been decades since Mackey thought about this nightly exercise in mapping. He recounted it last summer, when we were listening to \u201cSketches of Spain\u201d together over Zoom. I had asked if we could talk about the music that had opened his imagination. In his book- and record-lined den in Durham, North Carolina, where he is a professor of creative writing at Duke, he held up his original copy of the album. \u201cI would listen to the scratches on a Miles Davis record,\u201d he said.", "Mackey, who is seventy-three, won the National Book Award, in 2006, for the collection \u201cSplay Anthem,\u201d and he has been awarded Yale University\u2019s Bollingen Prize and the Poetry Foundation\u2019s Ruth Lilly prize. At the heart of his work are two series of poems he\u2019s been writing and publishing for about forty-seven years. He started one, \u201cSong of the Andoumboulou,\u201d in the mid-seventies, after he heard a recording of funeral chants from the Dogon people of Mali. The poems, of which there are now more than three hundred, explore the Dogon belief in what Mackey calls a \u201crough draft of a human being, the work-in-progress we continue to be.\u201d \u201cMu,\u201d a series that he began at roughly the same time, was originally a tribute to the trumpeter Don Cherry but then unfurled into a decades-long trancelike vision of the origins of music and mythology. He is approaching his three hundredth \u201cMu\u201d poem.", "Over the years, these two works have intertwined into what he calls \u201cthe long song,\u201d recounting the travels of a band of refugees, a \u201cphilosophic posse\u201d exiled somewhere outside of history as we understand it. The destination or substance of their wanderings\u2014the surreal moments when they cross paths with a description of Eric Dolphy\u2019s clarinet, an imaginary tune about Eric Garner, the view from a slaver\u2019s ship, or a nineteen-eighties military campaign\u2014matters less than the sensations and mystical visions they gather along the way. They are constantly starting over, discovering worlds within their worlds. Their journeys don\u2019t tell a story so much as they map a kind of alternative history of humankind. \u201cThe world was ever after, / elsewhere. / . . . no / way where we were / was there.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s writing music in English,\u201d Jeffrey Yang, his longtime editor at New Directions, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a song that includes this parallel universe, as what we\u2019re going through as individuals, as a community, as a country. It\u2019s taking another spin on poetry as being a form of diary writing, but what\u2019s included isn\u2019t just the personal, it\u2019s everything around it.\u201d", "This month, New Directions will publish \u201cDouble Trio,\u201d the continuation of Mackey\u2019s long song. It consists of three volumes, \u201cTej Bet,\u201d \u201cSo\u2019s Notice,\u201d and \u201cNerve Church,\u201d each of which is some three hundred pages, twice the length of one of Mackey\u2019s previous poetry books. He refers to the books as double albums and the collection as his boxed set. This spring, Fonograf Editions will release \u201cFugitive Equation,\u201d an album Mackey recorded with the Creaking Breeze Ensemble. And, in June, the University of Iowa Press will publish \u201cNathaniel Mackey, Destination Out,\u201d a collection of critical essays reflecting on his career.", "Some poets, Mackey explained, get that \u201csigh of recognition\u201d when they perform. \u201cWe try not to have that happen,\u201d he joked, in reference to his style. \u201cAudiences never know when I\u2019m done.\u201d", "Yang was an undergraduate when he first heard Mackey read, in the mid-nineties. He told me, \u201cI was, like, What is going on? He was quiet, soft-spoken, and these words were just spilling out.\u201d Mackey often sounds tranquil and digressive when he reads, as though he\u2019s working out a series of anagrams on the fly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of release, when you think that someone has said what I always thought,\u201d the poet and critic Fred Moten, who won a MacArthur Fellowship last year, explained. \u201cIt\u2019s more like What is that?\u201d", "Mackey\u2019s work calls to mind the world-building ambitions of Ezra Pound as well as the experiments in chronicling the Afro-Caribbean diaspora which are at the heart of Wilson Harris\u2019s and Edward Kamau Brathwaite\u2019s poetry. It\u2019s also influenced by what jazz musicians such as John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, and Cecil Taylor did in the sixties and seventies, stretching songs out to a full side of an LP. He describes his career in terms of \u201congoingness,\u201d the sense that \u201cyou\u2019re never finished.\u201d", "\u201cYou read it the first time,\u201d Moten said, \u201cand there\u2019s all this richness. Then you go back the thirty-seventh time, and what you discover is not the true meaning. What you discover is that all that\u2019s left to find is way more than you\u2019ll ever have time to find. It\u2019s more than you could ever have imagined. It\u2019s an amazing thing to see the whole thing and a detail of the thing at the same time. He writes the way that Brueghel painted crowd scenes.\u201d", "As well as working on the long song, Mackey has been an editor of Hambone, a respected poetry journal, since 1974. (He became the journal\u2019s sole editor and publisher in 1982.) He has also written five epistolary novels as part of a thirty-year-old open-ended prose project titled \u201cFrom a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate.\u201d It consists of letters written by N., a jazz musician in nineteen-seventies and eighties Los Angeles, to someone or something called the Angel of Dust, about the progress of a band he has formed.", "Mackey has spent the past year at his home, with his wife, Pascale, and two of their children. Except for an occasional doctor\u2019s appointment, he\u2019s been content to wait out the pandemic indoors. Last summer, we began Zooming weekly. I wanted to hear \u201cSketches of Spain\u201d the way he did, though I quickly realized that this was impossible.", "Mackey is five feet eleven inches tall, with the lean frame of a former athlete and shoulder-length dreads flecked with gray. He speaks slowly and carefully, rhythmically cycling through descriptions until he settles on the most precise language he can summon. He made me feel hopelessly inarticulate. Every so often, New Directions would send him a set of proofs of \u201cDouble Trio,\u201d and he would giddily point at the enormous pile of paper on his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s so unusual to be putting out a thousand pages of poetry in one fell swoop. There are all kinds of negative ways to interpret that,\u201d he said, before bursting out into laughter. \u201cNow I\u2019m asking people to read these three suckers!\u201d", "In high school, Mackey was one of the only Black students in his honors classes. He was also a star defensive back for the football team. \u00c9lite schools were admitting more Black students, and a group of Princeton alumni invited him for a campus visit, hoping that he might play football, or pole-vault for the school\u2019s track-and-field team. He and another local student, Gene Washington, later a star wide receiver with the San Francisco 49ers, flew out together.", "After Mackey told one of his student hosts that he had never seen jazz played live, the student arranged for Mackey to stay with his father in Harlem for a couple of days. The student\u2019s father took him to some jazz clubs, and Mackey saw the wildly inventive saxophonist and flutist Roland Kirk play with his band. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the players,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThese gods were there.\u201d It became an easy decision. \u201cAn hour-and-fifteen-minute bus ride from this? I was going to Princeton.\u201d", "The university introduced him to notions of prestige and status. \u201cI\u2019d never met a Black preppy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Black middle class wasn\u2019t a part of Santa Ana.\u201d Although he was homesick and disliked the snow, the proximity to living, breathing artists opened his eyes to a new path. He ran into Amiri Baraka, then known as LeRoi Jones, at a bookstore in Manhattan and invited him to give a reading at Princeton. Jones politely agreed. When he arrived, he addressed the assembled group of Black students as \u201cPavlov\u2019s dogs\u201d and spent his visit warning them about the domesticating tendencies of white institutions. Mackey went to a Coltrane gig in New York City and saw the saxophonist sitting at the bar between sets. Mackey introduced himself and asked if he would play \u201cEquinox.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to,\u201d Coltrane gently replied, \u201cbut we have a piece of music prepared.\u201d", "This was in 1965, when Coltrane had begun pursuing a freer, noisier, more liberated style. Mackey was transfixed. There was \u201ca quantum escalation in intensity,\u201d he said, as Coltrane and his group spent the entire night playing the standard \u201cOut of This World,\u201d in a frenzied style that radically deviated from the 1962 recording that Mackey knew by heart. \u201cI thought I knew Coltrane,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s moved on, so I gotta follow him.\u201d", "Seeing his idols made the possibility of pursuing a creative life more feasible. \u201cWhen I was a teen-ager, poets were not alive\u2014they were only in books,\u201d he said. At Princeton, he published some Jones-inspired poetry. But his primary creative outlet was d.j.\u2019ing at the campus radio station, where he became infatuated with searching for segues, resonances, and juxtapositions: \u201cHow different can two things be and still have something in common?\u201d"], "authors": ["Hua Hsu", "Hua Hs"], "keywords": ["poetry", "mackeys", "nathaniel", "jazz", "song", "spain", "mackey", "long", "told", "way", "hes", "music", "coltrane"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
