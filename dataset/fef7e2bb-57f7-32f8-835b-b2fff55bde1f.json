The city\u2019s very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city was the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world\u2019s finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and of course, a whole family of Strausses. In this capitvating city, there\u2019s also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School and the Vienna Boys\u2019 Choir. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire. There has also been a Yuletide market in Vienna since the Middle Ages and today the markets held over the festive period sell a huge range of seasonal gifts and mouth-watering treats. This morning we enjoy a tour in the company of a local guide who will offer insights into why Vienna is one of Europe\u2019s great capitals, now proudly embellished in winter sparkle. There will also be time to browse the stalls of the markets where the irresistible smell of roasting chestnuts fills the air. Alternatively retreat to the refined yet cosy elegance of a traditional Viennese caf\u00e9 for a steaming hot chocolate and a tempting pastry. After lunch on board we visit the magnificent Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. Once the summer residence of the Hapsburgs, this former royal residence now houses a range of world-class museums and galleries. Your included entrance and audio guide allows you into the dazzling state rooms, with their wealth of priceless artworks and the family\u2019s impressive royal carriages. The palace also hosts a superb Yuletide market, specialising in traditional handicrafts and nostalgic toys."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["royal", "wordsworth", "yuletide", "vienna", "markets", "residence", "today", "ms", "traditional", "museums", "palace", "danube", "range", "william"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
