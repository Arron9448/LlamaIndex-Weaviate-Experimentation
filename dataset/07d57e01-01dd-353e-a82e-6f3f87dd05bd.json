He\u2019d share stories from his time as ambassador to Japan with students at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. And most important, he took on the mission of preparing the next generation of leaders for the next big decision by serving as a mentor to so many. And I know that when the jury verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin was read, Fritz Mondale was with us rooting for justice.", "My first job in politics was as a college intern in Vice President Mondale\u2019s office in 1980 during his last year in office.

Nothing was missing. Second, take your jobs seriously, even when they aren\u2019t exactly what you planned. Thanks to him, that was my first job in Washington. And, again thanks to him, senator was my second.", "It was Walter Mondale who encouraged me to run for the Senate, which included his insistence that I get my reasons for running down to a 30-second elevator speech. \u201cThat\u2019s today\u2019s politics,\u201d he explained.", "This resulted in a series of phone calls, with me earnestly reciting my 30 seconds and him responding with his typical Norwegian understatement: \u201cThat\u2019s just not good enough. Call me back in an hour.\u201d This went on for most of a day until I could finally recite those 30 seconds of reasons, eventually taking them to the cornfields of southern Minnesota, the iron ore mines in the north, and ultimately, the halls of the Capitol."], "authors": ["Amy Klobuchar"], "keywords": ["walter", "klobuchar", "big", "thanks", "amy", "students", "things", "went", "vice", "learned", "thats", "washington", "job", "opinion", "mondale"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
