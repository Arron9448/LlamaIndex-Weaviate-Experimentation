He had no symptoms, and the rest of his family tested negative. Almost immediately, people began questioning his test results in the comments. \u201cI think it\u2019s a false positive!\u201d someone wrote. Two others suggested the same; one said she was sure she\u2019d recently had a false positive coronavirus test result, too, because she hadn\u2019t had symptoms and everyone else in her household tested negative. A scientist I know told me about an acquaintance who tested positive for the virus in January, decided his test was a false positive and did not isolate from family members who were visiting to meet his new baby.", "Just to be clear: \u201cIt is very ill advised to ignore a positive result just because you don\u2019t have symptoms,\u201d Daniel Diekema, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, told me. \u201cIt puts others at risk.\u201d An estimated one in five people who develop Covid-19 never have symptoms, and they can still infect others.", "More important, all the data we have so far show that when tests for the coronavirus come back positive, they are rarely wrong. A large majority of cases in the United States are found with a test that uses a technology called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. These tests should come back positive only if they detect genetic material that is specific to the coronavirus \u2014 which makes them far more accurate than many other kinds of diagnostic and screening tests, such as one for prostate cancer that assesses blood levels of a protein that can increase for many reasons other than malignancy.", "In most cases, \u201cthe rate of false positives is extremely low \u00ad\u2014 much lower than 1 percent,\u201d said Ilan Schwartz, an infectious disease clinician and researcher at the University of Alberta. Many of the commonly used P.C.R. tests in the United States had no false positives when tested in labs."], "authors": ["Melinda Wenner Moyer"], "keywords": ["assume", "united", "york", "times", "dont", "told", "covid19", "test", "symptoms", "tested", "university", "tests", "false", "coronavirus", "positive"], "pubDate": "2021-02-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
