As a matter of fact, I do. The PlayStation 5 exclusive feels like a throwback to games like Destruction Derby, but it breaks ranks from its other car-combat cousins by letting players run around on foot after their car is destroyed. It\u2019s a neat twist that emphasizes the disposable nature of everything that\u2019s happening \u2013 including the over-the-top drivers themselves. The whiplash-inducing crashes and unique character abilities are initially satisfying, but only the most dedicated rubberneckers will find a reason to stick around.", "Lucid Games wanted to try something unconventional by making the individual drivers the stars of the auto show. Each of the 16 characters has a bold presence that\u2019s largely conveyed by their wardrobe and cheeky pre-match animations. There\u2019s a lot of pro-wrestling-style posturing, and the introductions by UFC announcer Bruce Buffer are a perfect fit for the game\u2019s vibe.", "Events start with a mass scramble, as each character sprints to claim one of several available cars on the arena floor. Think of it like a high-stakes game of musical chairs; if two players go for the same car, it\u2019s first come, first served. The second player can leap onto the roof and attempt to yank the other driver out with a button-pressing microgame. A successful takeover gives the victor two options: slide into the driver\u2019s seat, or cause a wreck and find another car. It\u2019s a small moment in the game, but I really like this way of getting into the action. It makes the first moments a weird kind of mind game, as players either try to grab an unclaimed car or \u2013 troublemakers unite \u2013 they veer toward one that is in the process of getting claimed for the risky opportunity to score a quick K.O.", "Driving feels fantastic, with the precision handling that you\u2019d find in a top-tier kart racer. I found the simple act of cruising around genuinely satisfying, building up enough speed to ease onto the banked walls that enclose arenas or performing powerslides to drift dangerously close to pillars, walls, and other obstacles. Of course, other players aren\u2019t keen on indulging this Sunday-drive mentality. Fortunately, they\u2019re at least conceptually easy to deal with. Flicking up on the analog stick engages a speed boost, which lets you escape from harm\u2019s way \u2013 or smash into another car or hapless on-foot character. Similarly, a quick left or right will enable you to either juke away from opponents or sideswipe them, depending on what\u2019s happening at the moment. Even though my overall enthusiasm dimmed somewhat over time, I never stopped tensing up in anticipation of a big crash against an unaware enemy vehicle. It feels crunchy and satisfying.", "Cars accrue a lot of damage over the course of the matches; that\u2019s kind of the point, after all. That\u2019s where Destruction AllStars is at its best. Rather than be stuck in the corner somewhere in a smoldering soon-to-be wreck, you can fling yourself from your car whenever you want. Don\u2019t ask how characters are able to so easily bound into the air. The important thing is how great it feels, and the amount of flexibility it provides once you get the hang of it. When my car was clearly on its last legs \u2013 a sensation that\u2019s wonderfully reinforced with the DualSense\u2019s adaptive triggers tugging away at the gas and brakes \u2013 I beelined toward one of the myriad driverless cars hovering on platforms above the arena floor. There\u2019s just the right amount of suction that makes it easy to leap from one car into the seat of another and continue on your destructive way. You can also leap out at the last second to avoid a potential wreck, or if you just feel like it.", "On foot, you\u2019re a potential target for anyone, but you\u2019re fairly speedy and have access to some basic parkour techniques like wall running. Sometimes it makes sense to run toward the nearest replacement car, and other times it\u2019s more advantageous to pick up some of the collectable gems that are scattered on various platforms. These items help boost your Breaker meters, which are also built up by making contact with enemy cars. You have two Breaker abilities, one for your character and one for your character\u2019s unique car \u2013 which must be summoned by filling the vehicle Breaker bar. Each is unique for the character, which contributes to a dizzying amount of chaos in matches.", "Take Lupita, for instance. Her on-foot Breaker allows her to leave a trail of fire behind her, which sets opponents alight. Her unique vehicle\u2019s Breaker has a similar function, leaving Back to the Future-style flaming tire tracks behind her low-slung race car, which can bathe a tightly packed area in devastating flames. Or it can be used defensively to scorch someone who\u2019s following closely behind. Blue Fang, on the other hand, has a burlier unique ride with an array of sawblades mounted on front. For a short while, they can be turned on and, well, you can figure it out from there. His on-foot Breaker makes him resistant to enemy attacks, knocking down on-foot rivals who make the mistake of trying to melee him. I had a lot of fun testing out each hero and seeing how their various moves function. There\u2019s a great training mode that makes it easier to figure out the timing and duration of the Breakers, since each one is so different.", "Characters are the source of much of the game\u2019s variety, for better and worse. Destruction AllStars has four modes, two of which are free-for-alls and two are team based. Mayhem is the flagship mode, where 16 competitors battle for points in timed matches. Points are awarded by doing damage and wrecking opponents. It\u2019s about as simple as it gets. Gridfall gives you one life to see how long you can last in an arena that, frankly, doesn\u2019t seem safe. The floor steadily collapses, pushing players closer together and making navigation more and more precarious. Stockpile and Carnado have teams collect gears from opponents and deposit them into safes or a tornado, respectively. Offline, you can play a few story-based missions, like one inspired by Crazy Taxi. The modes are all pretty fun, but I kept coming back to Mayhem. It feels like it\u2019s the one closest to the game\u2019s core identity, and it\u2019s a nice way to blow off some steam.", "Lucid and Sony envision this as a live-service game, with new characters and modes coming as time goes on. Players will also be able to purchase cosmetic customizations for their favorite drivers. For now, I don\u2019t see the point of spending either the game\u2019s earned or premium currencies. For a game with such personality, the skins are boring palette swaps. I appreciate the fact that character skins affect the cars, too, but I didn\u2019t feel incentivized to spend the coins I earned over several hours to get a blue version of the thing that was green. You can also buy voice clips, emotes or other doodads, but I didn\u2019t find any of those particularly compelling, either.", "Destruction AllStars is a PlayStation 5 exclusive, and it does show off what the console can do. It\u2019s hindered by the game\u2019s basic design, through no real fault of Lucid Games. Sure, the SSD load times are fast when you\u2019re engaging with the offline single-player combat, but matchmaking can be a drawn-out bottleneck. And the action moves so quickly that it can be tricky to fully appreciate the visual fidelity. Time slows down during your best crashes in single-player, giving you a chance to savor every bit of bent metal. In multiplayer, you\u2019re obviously only given the slow-mo visuals when you\u2019re wrecked. I was stunned to see the level of detail when a giant sawblade sliced my car in half in the London arena. For a few seconds, I could see inside my car\u2019s cockpit and marvel at its lovingly rendered roll cage \u2013 and even its emergency fire extinguisher. Those kinds of moments are rare, however, since you\u2019re mostly plowing ahead at such ridiculous speeds that you can\u2019t bask in all the mayhem \u2013 or even know that the guy who T-boned you just used an emote they spent several bucks on.", "I had a good time behind the wheel in Destruction AllStars, even if I don\u2019t know that it has enough to keep me around forever. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t anything to do; there is a decent-enough selection of modes and activities between online and offline, with more on the way. And I appreciate the instantly satisfying action that\u2019s as easy to drop in and out of as the cars themselves. Even if the novelty of vehicular mayhem isn\u2019t enough to sustain my interest for many more long-haul sessions, I\u2019m looking forward to taking it for a quick spin every now and again."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["havoc", "breaker", "thats", "character", "cars", "allstars", "players", "unique", "games", "destruction", "review", "way", "car", "wrecking", "arena", "youre"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
