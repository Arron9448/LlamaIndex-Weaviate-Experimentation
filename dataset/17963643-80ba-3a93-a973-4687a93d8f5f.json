On January 1st that bracing vista became a Rorschach test for Brexit. A Leave voter may have seen an ocean of opportunity, and a new dawn for Britain. A Remainer might have wistfully seen an island cut adrift, and the sunset of British influence.", "Declinism is rampant in Britain. Some 65% of Britons think the country is \u201cin decline\u201d, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos MORI for The Economist, while 57% think today\u2019s youth will have a worse life than their parents. But gloom is unevenly distributed. Remainers are more likely to think Britain is in decline than Leavers, by 76% to 54%. Labour voters are far more declinist than Tories.", "Declinism, the gnawing belief in Britain\u2019s economic and strategic eclipse, was the most powerful idea of post-war politics. The task of escaping it consumed left and right in turn. It powered Harold Wilson\u2019s \u201cwhite heat of technology\u201d in the 1960s, and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s free-market revolution in the 80s. Correlli Barnett, a military historian who influenced Thatcher, thought the problem was that the elite went soft in the 19th century. Anthony Sampson, an anatomist of Britain, blamed Britain\u2019s rule by public-school bluffers instead of scientifically minded technocrats. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s now-departed chief adviser, took much the same view 50 years later."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["declinism", "britains", "think", "worse", "wistfully", "decline", "white", "britain", "view", "booming", "political", "attitudes", "seen", "youth"], "pubDate": "2021-01-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
