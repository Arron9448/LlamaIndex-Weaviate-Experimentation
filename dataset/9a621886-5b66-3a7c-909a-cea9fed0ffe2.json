Only qualifying to enter her first Grand Slam tournament in 2016, within two years, the Japanese-American player had won both the U.S. Open and the Australian Open; in 2020, she became the highest-earning female athlete in the world.", "Her trajectory as an up-and-coming style star has been thrilling to watch, too. Not only is there her willingness to push the boundaries with fashion off the court\u2014just take her collaboration with the Japanese label ADEAM at New York Fashion Week last spring\u2014but also her use of style to embrace and celebrate her heritage, paying tribute to her Haitian roots by wearing everything from Kente head wraps to Kerby Jean-Raymond\u2019s Pyer Moss. Finally, there is her keen instinct for fashion as a means of activism: as just one example, for her appearance at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, where she won her third Grand Slam title, Osaka wore a series of protective face masks powerfully honoring Black victims of police brutality.", "And today, Naomi Osaka is debuting her first campaign with a luxury fashion house: Louis Vuitton. For the brand\u2019s spring 2021 campaign, shot by creative director Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, Osaka wears a playful, kaleidoscopic minidress that feels perfectly in keeping with the tennis pro\u2019s love for bold color and print. It also marks the beginning of Osaka\u2019s new and ongoing role as an ambassador for the house, with further collaborative projects in the pipeline.", "Cover Look", "Tennis champion Naomi Osaka wears a Louis Vuitton dress. Photographed by Annie Leibovitz, Vogue, January 2021", "\u201cAside from tennis, my most treasured passion is fashion, and there is no brand more iconic than Louis Vuitton,\u201d says Osaka. \u201cIt is such an honor to work with Nicolas\u2014he\u2019s a designer I admire so much and we share a mutual love of Japanese culture and style. To become a global brand ambassador is truly a dream come true for me.\u201d Clearly, the feeling is mutual. In Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s words: \u201cNaomi is an exceptional woman who represents her generation and is also a role model for everyone. Her career and convictions are inspiring. I am in awe of Naomi, she stays true to herself and doesn\u2019t compromise on her values.\u201d", "While Osaka\u2019s taste for wearing agenda-setting labels has spanned the likes of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Sacai in the past, she first wore Louis Vuitton for her appearance on the cover of Vogue\u2019s January issue that debuted last month. Photographed by Annie Leibovitz against a backdrop of blue sky and swirling clouds, the tennis champion\u2019s asymmetric Louis Vuitton slip dress served as a stunning reminder that her approach to style is just as fierce as her conduct on the court. With a new chapter as an ambassador for the storied French fashion house, it seems Osaka\u2019s style journey is only just getting started."], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["tennis", "brand", "fashion", "louis", "naomi", "house", "vuitton", "osaka", "open", "newest", "vuittons", "ambassador", "osakas", "style"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
