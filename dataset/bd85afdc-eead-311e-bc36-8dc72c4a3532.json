Although destined for a missed cut anyway, Matthew Wolff was disqualified on Friday evening having signed for a lower score than he had delivered at the 17th hole of his second round.", "\u201cObviously I wanted to be around for the weekend,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI like this golf course. I feel like I play it very well. I just didn\u2019t putt very good. It\u2019s pretty simple. Six three-putts in two rounds, you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d he continued. \u201cObviously I didn\u2019t drive it great but drove it good enough, and I felt like I never was really too bad out of position, just the three-putts killed me. You take all the three-putts away, I\u2019m one under. That was kind of the difference. I just didn\u2019t putt very well.\u201d", "Koepka\u2019s scenario can be readily explained by the undergoing of knee surgery just last month. Not that the four-times major winner was placated by extenuating circumstance. \u201cHow disappointed do you think I am?\u201d Koepka asked. \u201cI worked my ass off just to get here and then to play like this is pretty disappointing.\u201d", "Koepka, who matched Johnson\u2019s score, suggested he may not play competitively again before the next major of the year. The US PGA Championship takes place at Kiawah Island in late May.", "Brooks Koepka is helped out of the creek up by his caddie, Ricky Elliott, on the 13th hole.

Way I look at it, I have two more days to do rehab that I probably wouldn\u2019t get if I was out here, and I\u2019ll get ready for the PGA.\u201d", "Garc\u00eda missed the cut by one, largely due to a Thursday 76; the 2017 champion signed for 72 in the second round. \u201cI think I played great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to know what to say. I felt like the way I played today, I should have never shot more than two or three under par. That should have been my worst score, and somehow, I don\u2019t know why, it just wouldn\u2019t happen. I couldn\u2019t shoot one more shot than I shot today, the way I played.\u201d", "McIlroy, who hadn\u2019t missed an Augusta cut since his second Masters appearance of 2010, did not appear for post-round media duties. Friday\u2019s 74 was two strokes better than day one.
