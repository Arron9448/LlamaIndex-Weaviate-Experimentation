She was there to assure viewers that, whatever else they might be hearing, the situation was remarkably calm. \u201cYou can see banks here and commercial complexes,\u201d the reporter, Sweta Srivastava, said, as she wound her way past local landmarks. \u201cThe situation makes you feel good, because the situation is returning to normal, and the locals are ready to live their lives normally again.\u201d She conducted no interviews; there was no one on the streets to talk to. Other coverage on Republic TV showed people dancing ecstatically, along with the words \u201cJubilant Indians celebrate Modi\u2019s Kashmir masterstroke.\u201d A week earlier, Modi\u2019s government had announced that it was suspending Article 370 of the constitution, which grants autonomy to Kashmir, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. The provision, written to help preserve the state\u2019s religious and ethnic identity, largely prohibits members of India\u2019s Hindu majority from settling there. Modi, who rose to power trailed by allegations of encouraging anti-Muslim bigotry, said that the decision would help Kashmiris, by spurring development and discouraging a long-standing guerrilla insurgency. To insure a smooth reception, Modi had flooded Kashmir with troops and detained hundreds of prominent Muslims\u2014a move that Republic TV described by saying that \u201cthe leaders who would have created trouble\u201d had been placed in \u201cgovernment guesthouses.\u201d The change in Kashmir upended more than half a century of careful politics, but the Indian press reacted with nearly uniform approval. Ever since Modi was first elected Prime Minister, in 2014, he has been recasting the story of India, from that of a secular democracy accommodating a uniquely diverse population to that of a Hindu nation that dominates its minorities, especially the country\u2019s two hundred million Muslims. Modi and his allies have squeezed, bullied, and smothered the press into endorsing what they call the \u201cNew India.\u201d Kashmiris greeted Modi\u2019s decision with protests, claiming that his real goal was to inundate the state with Hindu settlers. After the initial tumult subsided, though, the Times of India and other major newspapers began claiming that a majority of Kashmiris quietly supported Modi\u2014they were just too frightened of militants to say so aloud. Television reporters, newly arrived from Delhi, set up cameras on the picturesque shoreline of Dal Lake and dutifully repeated the government\u2019s line. As the reports cycled through the news, the journalist Rana Ayyub told me over the phone that she was heading to Kashmir. Ayyub, thirty-six years old, is one of India\u2019s best-known investigative reporters, famous for relentlessly pursuing Modi and his aides. As a Muslim from Mumbai, she has lived on the country\u2019s sectarian divide her whole life. She suspected that the government\u2019s story about Kashmir was self-serving propaganda. \u201cI think the repression is probably worse than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know what she might find, but, she told me, \u201cI want to speak to those unheard voices.\u201d In both Hindi and English, Ayyub speaks with disorienting speed and infectious warmth; it is difficult to resist answering her questions, but she might have another one before you finish responding to the first. On the phone, she invited me to meet her in Mumbai and try to get into Kashmir, even though foreign correspondents were banned there during the crackdown. When I arrived, she handed me a pair of scarves and told me to buy a kurta, the typical Indian tunic. \u201cI am ninety-nine per cent sure you will be caught, but you should come anyway,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cJust don\u2019t open your mouth.\u201d Ayyub and I landed at the Srinagar airport two weeks after Modi\u2019s decree. In the terminal was a desk labelled \u201cRegistration for Foreigners,\u201d which she hustled me past, making sure I kept my head down. The crowd was filled with police and soldiers, but we made it to the curb without being spotted, climbed into a taxi, and sped off into Srinagar. Even from a moving car, it was clear that the reality in Kashmir veered starkly from the picture in the mainstream Indian press. Soldiers stood on every street corner. Machine-gun nests guarded intersections, and shops were shuttered on each block. Apart from the military presence, the streets were lifeless. At Khanqah-e-Moula, the city\u2019s magnificent eighteenth-century mosque, Friday prayers were banned. Schools were closed. Cell-phone and Internet service was cut off. Indian intelligence agents are widely understood to monitor the rosters of local hotels, so Ayyub and I, along with an Indian photographer named Avani Rai, had arranged to stay with a friend. When we got there, a Kashmiri doctor who was visiting the house told us to check the main hospital, where young men were being treated after security forces fired on them. The police and soldiers were using small-gauge shotguns\u2014called pellet guns by the locals\u2014and some of the victims had been blinded. \u201cGo to the ophthalmology ward,\u201d the doctor said. At the hospital, we found a scene of barely restrained chaos, with security officers standing guard and families mixing with the sick in corridors. While I stood in a corner, trying to make myself inconspicuous, Ayyub ran to the fourth floor to speak to an eye doctor. After a few minutes, she returned and motioned for me and Rai to follow. \u201cWard eight,\u201d she said. Thirty gunshot victims were inside. \u201c \u2018Too many tote bags,\u2019 they said.\u201d Cartoon by Will McPhail As the three of us approached, a smartly dressed man with a close-cropped beard stepped into our path and placed his hand on Ayyub\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he said. Rai looked at me and quietly said, \u201cRun.\u201d I turned and dashed into the crowd. The bearded man took Ayyub and Rai by the arm and led them away.", "Ayyub grew up in Sahar, a middle-class neighborhood of Mumbai. Her father, Waquif, wrote for a left-wing newspaper called Blitz; later, he was a high-school principal and a scholar of Urdu, the language of north India\u2019s Muslims. Rana remembers midnight poetry readings, when her father\u2019s friends crowded into the living room to recite their verses. The Ayyubs were the only Muslim family on the block, but they weren\u2019t isolated. They went into the streets with their neighbors to celebrate Hindu festivals like Holi and Diwali, and twice a year they opened their home for Muslim feasts. \u201cThe sectarian issue was always there, but we were insulated from all that,\u201d Ayyub said. \u201cAll of my friends growing up were Hindu.\u201d Muslim-Hindu harmony was central to the vision of India\u2019s founders, Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who laid the foundation for a secular state. India is home to all the world\u2019s major religions; Muslims constitute about fourteen per cent of the population. As the British Empire prepared to withdraw, in 1947, Muslims were so fearful of Hindu domination that they clamored for a separate state, which became Pakistan. The division of the subcontinent, known as Partition, inspired the largest migration in history, with tens of millions of Hindus and Muslims crossing the new borders. In the accompanying violence, as many as two million people died. Afterward, both Pakistanis and Indians harbored enduring grievances over the killings and the loss of ancestral land. Kashmir, on the border, became the site of a long-running proxy war. India\u2019s remaining Muslims protected themselves by forging an alliance with the Congress Party\u2014Gandhi and Nehru\u2019s group, which monopolized national politics for fifty years. But the founders\u2019 vision of the secular state was not universally shared. In 1925, K. B. Hedgewar, a physician from central India, founded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an organization dedicated to the idea that India was a Hindu nation, and that Hinduism\u2019s followers were entitled to reign over minorities. Members of the R.S.S. believed that many Muslims were descended from Hindus who had been converted by force, and so their faith was of questionable authenticity. (The same thinking applied to Christians, who make up about two per cent of India\u2019s population. Other major religions, including Buddhism and Sikhism, were considered more authentically Indian.) Hedgewar was convinced that Hindu men had been emasculated by colonial domination, and he prescribed paramilitary training as an antidote. An admirer of European fascists, he borrowed their predilection for khaki uniforms, and, more important, their conviction that a group of highly disciplined men could transform a nation. He thought that Gandhi and Nehru, who had made efforts to protect the Muslim minority, were dangerous appeasers; the R.S.S. largely sat out the freedom struggle. In January, 1948, soon after independence, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Vinayak Godse, a former R.S.S. member and an avowed Hindu nationalist. The R.S.S. was temporarily banned and shunted to the fringes of public life, but the group gradually re\u00ebstablished itself. In 1975, amid civic disorder and economic stagnation, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi suspended parliament and imposed emergency rule. The R.S.S. vigorously opposed her and her Congress Party allies. Many of its members were arrested, which helped legitimize the group as it re\u00ebntered the political mainstream. The R.S.S.\u2019s original base was higher-caste men, but, in order to grow, it had to widen its membership. Among the lower-caste recruits was an eight-year-old named Narendra Modi, from Vadnagar, a town in the state of Gujarat. Modi belonged to the low-ranking Ghanchi caste, whose members traditionally sell vegetable oil; Modi\u2019s father ran a small tea shop near the train station, where his young son helped. When Modi was thirteen, his parents arranged for him to marry a local girl, but they cohabited only briefly, and he did not publicly acknowledge the relationship for many years. Modi soon left the marriage entirely and dedicated himself to the R.S.S. As a pracharak\u2014the group\u2019s term for its young, chaste foot soldiers\u2014Modi started by cleaning the living quarters of senior members, but he rose quickly. In 1987, he moved to the R.S.S.\u2019s political branch, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. When Modi joined, the Party had only two seats in parliament. It needed an issue to attract sympathizers, and it found one in an obscure religious dispute. In the northern city of Ayodhya was a mosque, called Babri Masjid, built by the Mughal emperor Babur in 1528. After independence, locals placed Hindu idols inside the mosque and became convinced that it had been built on the former site of a Hindu temple. A legend grew that the god Ram\u2014an avatar of Vishnu, often depicted with blue skin\u2014had been born there. In September, 1990, a senior B.J.P. member named L. K. Advani began calling for Babri Masjid to be destroyed and for a Hindu temple to take its place. To build support for the idea, he undertook a two-month pilgrimage, called the Ram Rath Yatra, across the Indian heartland. Travelling aboard a Nissan jeep refitted to look like a chariot, he sometimes gave several speeches a day, inflaming crowds about what he saw as the government\u2019s favoritism toward Muslims; sectarian riots followed in his wake, leaving hundreds dead. Advani was arrested before he reached Ayodhya, but other B.J.P. members carried on, gathering supporters and donations along the way. On December 6, 1992, a crowd led by R.S.S. partisans swarmed Babri Masjid and, using axes and hammers, began tearing the building down. By nightfall, it had been completely razed. The destruction of the mosque incited Hindu-Muslim riots across the country, with the biggest and bloodiest of them in Mumbai. At first, Ayyub\u2019s family felt safe; they were surrounded by friends. But, after several days of mayhem, a Sikh friend, whom the family called Uncle Bagga, came to tell Waquif that a group of neighborhood men were coming for his daughters. Waquif was frightened; Rana, who was then nine years old, had been stricken by polio and, though she was largely recovered, the illness had weakened the left side of her body. That night, she and her older sister Iffat fled with Bagga. They stayed with some relatives of his for three months, before the family reunited in Deonar, a Muslim ghetto a few miles away. \u201cI felt helpless,\u201d Rana told me. \u201cWe were like toys, moved from one place to another by someone else.\u201d Deonar is an impoverished neighborhood of fetid sewers and tin shacks. The Ayyubs, accustomed to a middle-class existence, found their lives transformed. \u201cWe were living in a very small place, very dirty, on a very crowded and dirty street,\u201d Rana said. Mumbai had been transformed, too. When she enrolled in a predominantly Hindu school nearby, her classmates called her landya, an anti-Muslim slur. \u201cThat is the first time I ever really thought about my identity,\u201d she said. \u201cOur entire neighborhood\u2014our friends\u2014were going to kill us.\u201d For the R.S.S., the initiative in Ayodhya paid off spectacularly. Membership soared, and by 1996 the B.J.P. had become the largest party in parliament. During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. \u201cModi was a fascist in every sense,\u201d Nandy said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean this as a term of abuse. It\u2019s a diagnostic category.\u201d", "On February 27, 2002, a passenger train stopped in Godhra, a city in Gujarat. It was coming from Ayodhya, where many of the passengers had gone to visit the site where Babri Masjid was destroyed, ten years earlier, and to advocate for building a temple there. Most of them belonged to the religious wing of the R.S.S., called the V.H.P. While the train sat at the station, Hindu travellers and Muslims on the platform began to heckle one another. As the train pulled away, it stalled, and the taunting escalated. At some point, someone\u2014possibly a Muslim vender with a stove\u2014threw something on fire into one of the cars. The flame spread, and the passengers were trapped inside; when the door was finally pushed open, the rush of oxygen sparked a fireball. Some fifty-eight people suffocated or burned to death. As word of the disaster spread, the state government allowed members of the V.H.P. to parade the burned corpses through Ahmedabad, the state\u2019s largest city. Hindus, enraged by the display, began rampaging and attacking Muslims across the state. Mobs of Hindus prowled the streets, yelling, \u201cTake revenge and slaughter the Muslims!\u201d According to eyewitnesses, rioters cut open the bellies of pregnant women and killed their babies; others gang-raped women and girls. In at least one instance, a Muslim boy was forced to drink kerosene and swallow a lighted match. Ehsan Jafri, an elderly Congress Party politician, was paraded naked and then dismembered and burned. The most sinister aspect of the riots was that they appeared to have been largely planned and directed by the R.S.S. Teams of men, armed with clubs, guns, and swords, fanned out across the state\u2019s Muslim enclaves, often carrying voter rolls and other official documents that led them to Muslim homes and shops. The Chief Minister of the Gujarati government was Narendra Modi, who had been appointed to the position five months before. As the riots accelerated, Modi became invisible; he summoned the Indian Army but held the soldiers in their barracks as the violence spun out of control. In many areas of Gujarat, the police not only stood by but, according to numerous human-rights groups, even took part. When the riots began, Rahul Sharma was the senior police officer in charge of Bhavnagar, a district with a Muslim population of more than seventy thousand. In sworn testimony, Sharma later said that he received no direction from his superiors about how to control the riots. On the fourth day, a crowd of thousands gathered around the Akwada Madrassa, a Muslim school, which had about four hundred children inside. The vigilantes were brandishing swords and torches. \u201cThey were acting in an organized way,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThey were going to kill the children.\u201d Sharma ordered his men to use lethal force to prevent an attack; when warning shots had no effect, they fired, killing two men and injuring several more. The crowd scattered, and Sharma escorted the children to safety. In nearly every other district, though, the violence carried on unchecked. Sharma, instead of being celebrated as a hero, was transferred out of the district to a make-work desk job. L. K. Advani\u2014the advocate of destroying the mosque in Ayodhya, who had risen to be India\u2019s Home Minister\u2014called Sharma and suggested that he had let too many Hindus die. The journalist Rana Ayyub is renowned for pursuing Modi and his aides. Photograph by Supranav Dash for The New Yorker The riots dragged on for nearly three months; when they were over, as many as two thousand people were dead and nearly a hundred and fifty thousand had been driven from their homes. The ethnic geography of Gujarat was transformed, with most of its Muslims crowded into slums. One slum formed inside the Ahmedabad dump, a vast landscape of trash and sewage that towered hundreds of feet in the air. (That ghetto, dubbed Citizens\u2019 Village by its inhabitants, is still home to a thousand people, who live in shacks and breathe the noxious air; when the monsoons come, filth from the dump floods the streets and shanties.) As the riots festered, Ayyub, who was then nineteen, decided to help. After telling her mother that she was going trekking with a friend in the Himalayas, she put herself on a train to the Gujarati city of Vadodara. Because the unrest was still flaring, she disguised herself with a bright-red bindi\u2014the dot of paint that Hindu women wear on their forehead. She spent three weeks in relief camps, helping rape victims file police reports. The camps were surrounded by open-pit latrines, and the smell of sewage was overpowering; children lay around with flies on them. At times, mobs armed with swords and Molotov cocktails came looking for Muslims. During one incursion, Ayyub hid in a house and peered out as a crowd of some sixty men jostled outside. \u201cI was palpitating,\u201d she said. \u201cGujarat made me realize that what happened in Mumbai was not an aberration.\u201d", "After the riots, Modi\u2019s government did almost nothing to provide for the tens of thousands of Muslims forced from their homes; aid was supplied almost entirely by volunteers. Asked about this, Modi said, \u201cRelief camps are actually child-making factories. Those who keep on multiplying the population should be taught a lesson.\u201d Although some Hindu rioters were arrested, just a few dozen were ultimately convicted. Mayaben Kodnani, a B.J.P. minister, was the only official to be punished significantly; she was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy. When Modi\u2019s government later came to power in Delhi, she was cleared of all charges. In the following months, there were indications of substantial government complicity. According to independent investigations, the Hindu mobs had moved decisively, following leaders who appeared to have received explicit instructions. \u201cThese instructions were blatantly disseminated by the government, and in most cases, barring a few sterling exceptions, methodically carried out by the police and Indian Administrative Service,\u201d concluded a citizen-led inquiry that included former Supreme Court justices and a former senior police official. During the violence, a senior federal official named Harsh Mander travelled to Gujarat and was stunned by the official negligence. Seeing that many of his colleagues were colluding in the bloodbath, he retired early from his job to work in the makeshift camps where Muslim refugees were gathering. He has dedicated much of the rest of his life to reminding the public what happened and who was responsible. \u201cNo sectarian riot ever happens in India unless the government wants it to,\u201d Mander told me. \u201cThis was a state-sponsored massacre.\u201d A few officials claimed that the decision to encourage the riots came from Modi himself. Haren Pandya, a Modi rival and Cabinet minister, gave sworn testimony about the riots, and also spoke to the newsweekly Outlook. He said that, on the night the unrest began, he had attended a meeting at Modi\u2019s bungalow, at which Modi ordered senior police officials to allow \u201cpeople to vent their frustration and not come in the way of the Hindu backlash.\u201d A police official named Sanjiv Bhatt recalled that, at another meeting that night, Modi had expressed his hope that \u201cthe Muslims be taught a lesson to ensure that such incidents do not recur.\u201d But there was not much political will to pursue the evidence against Modi, and his accusers did not stay in the public eye for long. After Bhatt made his accusation, he was charged in the death of a suspect in police custody\u2014a case that had sat dormant for more than two decades\u2014and sentenced to life in prison. In 2003, the Cabinet minister Haren Pandya was found dead in his car in Ahmedabad. His wife left little doubt about who she believed was behind it. \u201cMy husband\u2019s assassination was a political murder,\u201d she said.", "For Modi, the riots had a remarkable effect. The U.S. and the United Kingdom banned him for nearly a decade, and he was shunned by senior leaders of his party. (In 2004, the B.J.P. Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was voted out. He blamed Modi for the loss.) In Gujarat, though, his prestige grew. Rather than seeking reconciliation, Modi led a defiant Hindu-pride march across the state, which was met with an outpouring of support. Modi often spoke in barely coded language that signalled to his followers that he shared their bigotry. In one speech, during the march, he suggested that the state\u2019s Muslims were a hindrance to be overcome. \u201cIf we raise the self-respect and morale of fifty million Gujaratis,\u201d he said, \u201cthe schemes of Alis, Malis, and Jamalis will not be able to do us any harm.\u201d The crowd let out a cheer. That December, after a campaign in which he made several incendiary anti-Muslim speeches, he led the B.J.P. to a huge electoral victory in Gujarat. Elsewhere in India, the B.J.P.\u2019s fortunes were sinking; as a result, Modi\u2019s hard-line faction was able to seize the Party leadership. He also began to build a national reputation as a pro-business leader who presided over rapid economic development. \u201cThe B.J.P. was a dead party,\u201d Ayyub told me. \u201cThe only chance they had to power was Modi, because he had all these followers\u2014all these big businessmen\u2014and so the riots were all forgotten.\u201d Eventually, a Supreme Court investigative team declared that there was not enough evidence to charge Modi in the riots\u2014a finding that human-rights groups dismissed as politically motivated. A few persistent advocates tried to keep the issue alive. In 2007, when Modi appeared on the Indian network CNN-IBN, the journalist Karan Thapar asked him, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you say that you regret the killings?\u201d \u201cWhat I have to say I have said at that time,\u201d Modi replied, his face hardening. As Thapar kept pressing, Modi grew agitated. \u201cI have to rest,\u201d he said. \u201cI need some water.\u201d Then he removed his microphone and walked away. In 2013, when another reporter asked if he felt sorry about the deaths of so many Muslims, he suggested that he had been a helpless bystander. \u201cIf someone else is driving a car and we\u2019re sitting behind\u2014even then, if a puppy comes under the wheel, will it be painful?\u201d Modi said. \u201cOf course it is.\u201d To many observers, Modi\u2019s success stemmed from his willingness to play on profound resentments, which for decades had been considered offensive to voice in polite society. Even though India\u2019s Muslims were typically poorer than their fellow-citizens, many Hindus felt that they had been unjustly favored by the central government. In private, Hindus sniped that the Muslims had too many children and that they supported terrorism. The Gandhi-Nehru experiment had made Muslims feel unusually secure in India, and partly as a result there has been very little radicalization, outside Kashmir; still, many Hindus considered them a constant threat. \u201cModi became a hero for all the Hindus of India,\u201d Nirjhari Sinha, a scientist in Gujarat who investigated the riots, told me. \u201cThat is what people tell me, at parties, at dinners. People genuinely feel that Muslims are terrorists\u2014and it is because of Modi that Muslims are finally under control.\u201d", "In 1993, Ayyub\u2019s father wrote a book about the riots in Mumbai. He titled it \u201cI Am Alive\u201d\u2014his habitual response to friends who wrote to him during the unrest to see how he was. When Rana Ayyub began considering a career in journalism, she showed some of the same pugnacious self-assertion. \u201cIn my childhood, everybody said, \u2018She\u2019s a weak child,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have to prove a point to everybody that, no, I\u2019m not a weak child.\u201d At first, she wanted to effect change by joining the civil service. But, she said, \u201cpeople told me, \u2018There\u2019s no way you will be able to do anything as a police officer, because you still have to be answerable to cops and corrupt politicians.\u2019 \u201d After graduating from Sophia College in Mumbai with a degree in English literature, Ayyub bounced around from Web sites to a television station before landing at a magazine called Tehelka. Published in English, Tehelka had a small circulation but an outsized reputation for tough investigations. Ayyub took to the work, producing pieces on killings by the police and a smuggling racket run by officials in Mumbai. \u201cI was trying to help people,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was trying to figure out what was happening, and it made me feel better about myself.\u201d In 2010, in a series of cover stories for Tehelka, Ayyub tied Modi\u2019s closest adviser, Amit Shah, to a sensational crime. The scion of a high-caste family, Shah had trained as a biochemist but excelled as a political tactician. A onetime president of the Gujarat Chess Association, he had twice helped engineer Modi\u2019s election as the top official in Gujarat; afterward, he was made the Minister of State for Home Affairs. Ayyub was investigating a case that had begun five years before, when police in Gujarat announced that they had fatally shot a suspected terrorist dispatched by Pakistan to assassinate Modi. In political and journalistic circles, the announcement inspired skepticism; rumors had been circulating that the police killed criminals and then pretended that they were Muslim assassins, heroically thwarted just before they could get to Modi. Wised-up Indians derided the police claims as \u201cfake encounters,\u201d but, among Gujaratis who were alarmed by the riots, they helped boost Modi\u2019s reputation as a defender of Hindus. \u201cBut I\u2019m conducting an experiment: will the twentieth cookie taste as good as the first?\u201d Cartoon by William Haefeli It turned out that the alleged assassin, a local extortionist named Sohrabuddin Sheikh, had no history of Islamist militancy. Before long, federal investigators established that he had been murdered by the police. There were witnesses, including Sheikh\u2019s wife and a criminal associate of his. But, a couple of days after the killing, his wife was murdered and her body burned; the associate was killed in police custody a year later. Ayyub didn\u2019t believe that the ultimate responsibility lay with the police. \u201cI never looked at the arrests that were made, the people who shoot,\u201d she told me. \u201cI looked for the kingpins.\u201d One source, a police officer, suggested that Amit Shah had been involved. Ayyub first met the officer at a secluded house in the countryside. \u201cHe could see that my hands were shaking,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you\u2019re going to do this story, then you have to stop shaking.\u2019 \u201d The next time they met\u2014in a graveyard, at 3 A.M., with Ayyub disguised in a burqa\u2014he gave her a CD, hidden in a bouquet of flowers. It contained six years of Shah\u2019s telephone records, including the times and locations of his calls. Using the records, Ayyub showed that Shah and the three officers suspected of murdering Sheikh\u2019s associate had been in extensive contact, before and after the killing. Her reporting also offered an explanation of Shah\u2019s motive: a police official told her that the murdered criminals \u201cknew something that could have been damning for the minister.\u201d Ayyub was not the first journalist to expose official misconduct in the case, but the evidence around Shah was explosive. Federal agents asked her for a copy of Shah\u2019s phone records, and she obliged. Within weeks, Shah was arrested on charges of murder and extortion; he had allegedly been involved in the same illicit business as Sheikh. (A spokesman for Shah denied his complicity, saying, \u201cShah was implicated in the said criminal offence purely on political considerations.\u201d) Federal police eventually charged thirty-eight other people, including Gujarat\u2019s top police official, the former Home Minister for the state of Rajasthan, and more than twenty officers suspected of being involved in the murders. The morning of Shah\u2019s arrest, Ayyub awoke to find that her reporting was the top of the news. A popular television anchor read the entirety of one of her pieces on the air. \u201cI was just a twenty-six-year-old Muslim girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt people would finally see what I can do.\u201d Her stories, along with others, set off a series of official investigations into the Gujarati police, who were suspected of killing more than twenty people in \u201cfake encounters.\u201d But, she thought, even Shah was not the ultimate kingpin. Her source had told her that the police were under intense pressure to stall the investigation and to hide records from federal investigators\u2014suggesting that someone powerful was trying to squelch the case. The headline of one of her stories was \u201cSo Why Is Narendra Modi Protecting Amit Shah?\u201d Despite the evidence piling up around Modi, he only grew stronger. Increasingly, he was mentioned as a candidate for national office. In 2007, while running for re\u00eblection as Chief Minister, Modi taunted members of the Congress Party to come after him. \u201cCongress people say that Modi is indulging in \u2018encounters\u2019\u2014saying that Modi killed Sohrabuddin,\u201d he told a crowd of supporters. \u201cYou tell me\u2014what should I do with Sohrabuddin?\u201d he asked. \u201cKill him!\u201d the crowd roared. \u201cKill him!\u201d", "Within a few weeks of Shah\u2019s arrest, Ayyub hit on an idea for a new article: \u201cIf I can go after Shah, why not Modi?\u201d She told her editors at Tehelka that she suspected Modi of far graver crimes than previously reported. If she went undercover, she argued, she could insinuate herself into his inner circle and learn the truth. In the United States, it is a cardinal rule of journalism that reporters shouldn\u2019t lie about their identity; undercover operations tend to be confined to the industry\u2019s yellower margins. In India, the practice is more common, if still controversial. In 2000, Tehelka sent a former cricket player, wearing a hidden camera, to expose widespread match-fixing and bribery in the sport. Later that year, two reporters posing as representatives of a fake company offered to sell infrared cameras to the Ministry of Defense. Thirty-six officials agreed to take bribes; the Minister of Defense resigned. Tarun Tejpal, Tehelka\u2019s editor, told me that he authorized stings only when there appeared to be no other way to get the story. In this case, he said, \u201cModi and Shah were untouchable. The truth would never come out.\u201d He told Ayyub to go forward. As she began reporting, Ayyub created an elaborate disguise, designed to appeal to the vanities of Gujarat\u2019s political establishment. \u201cIndians have a weakness for being recognized in America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that they would be famous in the United States\u2014it was irresistible to them.\u201d She became Maithili Tyagi, an Indian-American student at the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles, visiting India to make a documentary. She invented a story about her family, saying that her father was a professor of Sanskrit and a devotee of Hindu-nationalist ideas. Ayyub, who has distinctive curly hair, straightened it and tucked it into a bun. She rehearsed an American accent, and, for added verisimilitude, hired a French assistant, whom she called Mike. Only her parents knew what she was doing; she stayed in touch on a separate phone. In the fall of 2010, Ayyub rented a tiny room in Ahmedabad. For eight months, she flattered her way into the local \u00e9lite, claiming that her film would focus on Gujaratis who were prospering under Modi\u2019s tenure. \u201cModi\u2019s biggest support comes from Gujarati-Americans,\u201d she told me. \u201cI said, I want to meet the most influential people who can tell me the Gujarat story\u2014who will tell me the secret sauce of what Mr. Modi has done in the past fifteen years.\u201d At first, Ayyub and Mike appeared only at apolitical social events, to get locals used to seeing them around. As she moved in closer, she began wearing hidden cameras and microphones\u2014in her watch, in her kurta, in her phone. (When she bought the minicams, at a Spy Shop in New Delhi, she told the salesman that she was trying to catch an adulterous husband.) Ayyub was welcomed nearly everywhere. She made revealing recordings of senior Gujarati officials, some of whom directly accused Modi and Shah of wrongdoing. Even Modi agreed to see her for a brief chat in his office, where his staff offered her biographies of him to read. Modi showed her copies of Barack Obama\u2019s books. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maithili, look at this. I want to be like him someday,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. She was struck by his canniness. \u201cI thought Modi was either going to be Prime Minister or he was going to jail.\u201d Ayyub took her findings back to her editors. But, after reviewing transcripts, Tejpal decided against publishing a story. The conversations were mostly of officials implicating others\u2014often Modi and Shah. Tejpal told me that he needed people admitting their own crimes. \u201cThe fundamental ethics of the sting is that a sting is no good if a person doesn\u2019t indict oneself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you come to me and say, \u2018I had a conversation with someone, and he told me that Tom, Dick, and Harry are fuckers, and he knows that Tom is taking money from So-and-So, and Harry really fucked So-and-So,\u2019 it means nothing. That\u2019s just cheap gossip.\u201d Ayyub was convinced that Tejpal had succumbed to pressure from the B.J.P. \u201cHe caved in,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was inside Modi\u2019s and Shah\u2019s inner circle, as close as you could get.\u201d (Tejpal denied this, and other editors spoke in support of him.) Determined to get her story out, Ayyub wrote a draft of a book and shopped it to English-language newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses. All rejected her pitch. Some said that the book was too partisan; most argued that her methods could expose them to lawsuits. Several editors told me privately that they thought Ayyub\u2019s work was revelatory\u2014but that it was impossible to publish. \u201cWe wanted to excerpt the book on the cover of our magazine, but word got around, and phone calls started coming in,\u201d Krishna Prasad, who was then the editor of Outlook, told me. \u201cWe simply couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d By 2012, Modi had become the most recognizable B.J.P. leader in India, and seemed likely to run for Prime Minister. \u201cEveryone saw the writing on the wall,\u201d Ayyub said. \u201cModi was going to win, and no one wanted to alienate him.\u201d Ayyub kept trying to find a publisher, but nothing came through. She told me that she fell into a profound funk, relying on antidepressants for the next four years. In 2013, Tejpal, her editor at Tehelka, was accused of sexual assault and spent seven months in prison before being released on bail. (He maintains his innocence, and the case is ongoing.) The magazine all but collapsed. \u201cI thought that was the end,\u201d she said.", "As Modi began his run for Prime Minister, in the fall of 2013, he sold himself not as a crusading nationalist but as a master manager, the visionary who had presided over an economic boom in Gujarat. His campaign\u2019s slogan was \u201cThe good days are coming.\u201d A close look at the data showed that Gujarat\u2019s economy had grown no faster under his administration than under previous ones\u2014the accelerated growth was \u201ca fantastically crafted fiction,\u201d according to Prasad, the former editor. Even so, many of India\u2019s largest businesses flooded his campaign with contributions. Modi was helped by an overwhelming public perception that the Congress Party, which had been in power for most of the past half century, had grown arrogant and corrupt. Its complacency was personified by the Gandhi family, whose members dominated the Party but appeared diffident and out of touch. Rahul Gandhi, the head of the Party (and Nehru\u2019s great-grandson), was dubbed the \u201creluctant prince\u201d by the Indian media. \u201cPeople genuinely feel that Muslims are terrorists\u2014and it is because of Modi that Muslims are finally under control,\u201d Nirjhari Sinha, a scientist in Gujarat, said. Photograph by Arko Datto for The New Yorker By contrast, Modi and his team were disciplined, focussed, and responsive. \u201cThe Gandhis would keep chief ministers, who had travelled across the country to see them, waiting for days\u2014they didn\u2019t care,\u201d an Indian political commentator who has met the Gandhis as well as Modi told me. \u201cWith Modi\u2019s people, you got right in.\u201d While the Congress leaders often behaved as if they were entitled to rule, the B.J.P.\u2019s leaders presented themselves as ascetic, committed, and incorruptible. Modi, who is said to do several hours of yoga every day, typically wore simple kurtas, and members of his immediate family worked in modest jobs and were conspicuously absent from senior government positions; whatever other allegations floated around him, he could not be accused of material greed. The B.J.P. won a plurality of the popular vote, placing Modi at the head of a governing coalition. As Prime Minister, he surprised many Indians by challenging people to confront problems that had gone unaddressed. One was public defecation, a major cause of disease throughout India. At an early speech in Delhi, he announced a nationwide program to build public toilets in every school\u2014a prosaic improvement that gratified many Indians, even those who could afford indoor plumbing. Modi also addressed a series of widely publicized gang rapes by speaking in bracingly modern terms. \u201cParents ask their daughters hundreds of questions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut have any dared to ask their sons where they are going?\u201d The address set the tone for Modi\u2019s premiership, or at least for part of it. As a young pracharak, he had taken a vow of celibacy, and he gave no public sign of breaking it. Unburdened by family commitments, he worked constantly. People who saw him said he exuded a vitality that seemed to compensate for his otherwise solitary existence. \u201cWhen you have that kind of power, that kind of adoration, you don\u2019t need romance,\u201d the Indian political commentator told me. In Gujarat, Modi had focussed on big-ticket projects, wooing car manufacturers and bringing electricity to villages; as Prime Minister, he introduced a sweeping reform of bankruptcy laws and embarked on a multibillion-dollar campaign of road construction. Modi\u2019s effort to transform his image succeeded in the West, as well. In the United States, newspaper columnists welcomed his emphasis on markets and efficiency. In addition, Modi called on a vast network of Indian-Americans, who cheered his success at putting India on the world stage. The Obama Administration quietly dropped the visa ban. When Modi met Obama, not long after taking office, the two visited the memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., a man Modi claimed to admire. During his stay, Modi had a dinner meeting with Obama, but he presented White House chefs with a dilemma: he was fasting for Navaratri, a Hindu festival. At the meeting, he consumed only water. The Indian political commentator, who met with Modi during his first term, told me that in person he was intense and inquisitive but not restless; he joked about the monkeys that were marauding his garden, and happily discussed the arcana of projects that were occupying his attention. The main one was water: India\u2019s groundwater reserves were declining quickly (they\u2019ve gone down by sixty-one per cent in the past decade), and Modi was trying to prepare for a future in which the country could run dry. During the meeting, he also displayed a detailed list of nations that were in need of various professionals\u2014lawyers, engineers, doctors\u2014of the very kind that India, with its huge population of graduates, could provide. \u201cHe is smart, extremely focussed,\u201d the commentator said. \u201cAnd, yes, a bit puritanical.\u201d Not long after Modi took power, the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, in which his old friend Amit Shah was implicated, ground to a halt. By 2014, Shah had essentially stopped showing up for hearings. When the judge ordered Shah to appear, the case was taken away from him, in defiance of the Supreme Court. The new judge, Brijgopal Loya, also complained about Shah\u2019s failure to show up in court. He told his family and friends that he was under \u201cgreat pressure\u201d to dismiss the case, and that the chief justice of the Bombay High Court had offered him sixteen million dollars to scuttle it. (The chief justice could not be reached for comment.) Loya died not long after, in mysterious circumstances. The coroner\u2019s report said that he had suffered a heart attack, but, according to The Caravan, a leading Indian news magazine, details in the report appeared to have been falsified. The arrangements for Loya\u2019s body to be returned to his family were made not by government officials but by a member of the R.S.S.; it arrived spattered in blood. Loya\u2019s family asked for an official investigation into his death but has not received one. Shah\u2019s case was given to a third judge, M. B. Gosavi, who after less than a month dismissed all charges, saying that he found \u201cno sufficient ground to proceed.\u201d Subsequent efforts to hold anyone accountable for Sohrabuddin Sheikh\u2019s death came to nothing. As the trial of the remaining defendants approached, ninety-two witnesses turned against the prosecution, with some saying they feared for their lives; the defendants were acquitted. Rajnish Rai, the officer tasked with investigating Shah, was transferred off the case. When he applied for early retirement, he was suspended. By the time the charges were dropped, Modi had installed Shah as president of the B.J.P. and chairman of the governing coalition\u2014effectively making him the country\u2019s second most powerful man.", "In 2016, after four years of trying to find a publisher for her book, Ayyub decided to publish it herself. To pay for it, she sold the gold jewelry that her mother had been saving for her wedding. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting married anytime soon anyway,\u201d she told me, laughing. She found a printer willing to reproduce the manuscript without reading it first, and cut a deal with a book distributor to share any profits. She persuaded an artist friend to design an appropriately ominous cover. Ayyub was protected by the fact that, as an English-language book, it would be read only by India\u2019s \u00e9lite, too small a group to concern the B.J.P. That May, the book went on sale on Amazon and in bookstores around the country. She called it \u201cGujarat Files: Anatomy of a Cover Up.\u201d \u201cGujarat Files\u201d relates the highlights of the discussions Ayyub had with senior officials as she tried to figure out what happened during Modi\u2019s and Shah\u2019s time presiding over the state. It is not a polished work; it reads like a pamphlet for political insiders, rushed into publication by someone with no time to check punctuation or spell out abbreviations or delve into the historical background of the cases discussed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the resources to think about all that,\u201d Ayyub told me. \u201cI just wanted to get the story out.\u201d The virtue of the book is that it feels like being present at a cocktail party of Hindu nationalists, speaking frankly about long-suppressed secrets. \u201cHere is the thing,\u201d Ayyub said. \u201cEverybody has heard the truth\u2014but you can\u2019t be sure. With my book, you can hear it from the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201d Among those whom Ayyub \u201cstung\u201d was Ashok Narayan, who had been Gujarat\u2019s Home Secretary during the riots. According to Ayyub, Narayan said that Modi had decided to allow the Hindu nationalists to parade the bodies of the victims of the train attack. Narayan said that he had warned Modi, \u201cThings will go out of hand,\u201d but to no avail. When he resisted, Modi went around him. \u201cBringing the bodies to Ahmedabad flared up the whole thing, but he is the one who took the decision,\u201d he said. Narayan added that the V.H.P.\u2014the religious arm of the R.S.S.\u2014had made preparations for large-scale attacks on the Muslim community and was merely looking for a pretext. \u201cIt was all planned by the V.H.P.\u2014it was gruesome,\u201d Narayan said, adding that he believed Modi was in on the plan from the beginning. \u201cHe knew everything.\u201d G. C. Raigar, a senior police official, told Ayyub that the initial plan was to allow the Hindus to take limited revenge for the attack. But, he said, the violence spread so quickly that Modi\u2019s government could no longer stop it: \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to use force against the rioters\u2014which is why things went out of control.\u201d Raigar, among others, told Ayyub that the decision to allow reprisals against Muslims was communicated outside the normal chain of command, from officials around Modi to police officers who were thought to harbor sectarian animosities. \u201cThey would tell it to people they had obliged in the past,\u201d Raigar said of the officials. \u201cThey would know who would help them.\u201d Some of the officials spoke of the killings in a remarkably casual way, as if the Muslims had deserved to be murdered. \u201cThere were riots in \u201985, \u201987, \u201989, \u201992, and most of the times the Hindus got a beating\u2014and the Muslims got an upper hand,\u201d P. C. Pande, Ahmedabad\u2019s former police commissioner, said. \u201cSo this time, in 2002, it had to happen, it was the retaliation of Hindus.\u201d Pande guided Ayyub through his rationale: \u201cHere is a group of Muslims going and setting fire on a train\u2014so what will be your reaction?\u201d \u201cYou hit them back?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then voil\u00e0! The same leaf you just raked up.\u201d Cartoon by P. C. Vey \u201cYes, you hit them back,\u201d Pande said. \u201cHere is the chance, give it back to them. . . . Why should anybody mind?\u201d Conversations like that, Ayyub wrote, convinced her that the riots had happened because people in power wanted them to: \u201cIt was as if the missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle were beginning to emerge.\u201d Several officers also said that Shah had presided over extrajudicial killings\u2014including those of the alleged assassin Sohrabuddin Sheikh and the witnesses to his murder. The conversations about Shah strengthened Ayyub\u2019s conviction that many more criminal suspects had been eliminated in a similar way. \u201cIt was clear that the encounters were only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she wrote. Initially, the reaction to Ayyub\u2019s book was muted. There was a reception in New Delhi, attended by most of the country\u2019s major political writers and editors\u2014but Ayyub couldn\u2019t find a word about it in any paper the next day. Newspapers were slow to review the book. But it took off on its own, especially on Amazon, helped by Ayyub\u2019s reputation as a journalist. The release of a Hindi edition, in 2017, opened up a huge potential audience. To date, Ayyub says, \u201cGujarat Files\u201d has sold six hundred thousand copies and been translated into thirteen languages. Ayyub has been invited to speak at the United Nations and at journalism conferences around the world. \u201cWhat makes it compelling is knowing that these are the biggest players in what happened,\u201d Hartosh Singh Bal, the political editor of The Caravan, told me. \u201cThey are speaking in unguarded moments, and they are confirming and adding to the knowledge of what we have already from every other source so far. But never from this much on the inside. And suddenly we put a speaker right in the heart of the room with the people who know everything.\u201d Perhaps the main factor that made \u201cGujarat Files\u201d a sensation was the climate in which it appeared. By 2016, two years into Modi\u2019s first term, he was in the midst of a campaign to crush any voice that challenged the new order.", "In April, 2018, Ayyub was sitting with a friend in a Delhi restaurant when a source alerted her to a video that was appearing in online chat groups maintained by B.J.P. supporters. He sent her the clip, and she pressed Play. What appeared on her screen was a pornographic video purporting to show Ayyub engaging in various sex acts. \u201cI burst into tears and threw up,\u201d she said. The clip went viral, making its way from WhatsApp to Facebook to Twitter, retweeted and shared countless times. Ayyub was inundated with angry messages, often with the video attached. \u201cHello bitch,\u201d a man named Himanshu Verma wrote in a direct message on Facebook. \u201cPlz suck my penis too.\u201d The video was the crudest salvo in a media campaign that started soon after the publication of Ayyub\u2019s book. A tweet with a fake quote from her, asking for leniency for Muslims who had raped children, went viral. Other falsified tweets followed, including one in which she declared her hatred of India. In response, someone named Vijay Singh Chauhan wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t ever let me see you, or we\u2019ll tell the whole world what we do to whores like you. Pack your bag and go to back to Pakistan.\u201d India\u2019s female journalists are often subjected to an especially ugly form of abuse. The threats that Ayyub received were nearly identical to those sent to Gauri Lankesh, a journalist and book publisher from the southern state of Karnataka. Like Ayyub, Lankesh had reported aggressively on Hindu nationalism and on violence against women and lower-caste people. She had also published Ayyub\u2019s book in Kannada, the predominant language in the state. \u201cWe were like sisters,\u201d Ayyub told me. In September, 2017, after Lankesh endured a prolonged campaign of online attacks, two men shot her dead outside her home and fled on a motorbike. Neha Dixit, who has done groundbreaking reporting on the B.J.P., told me that she receives death threats and sexual insults constantly: \u201cEvery day, I get three hundred notifications, with dick pics, and with conversations about how they should rape me with a steel rod or a rose thornbush or something like that.\u201d For Dixit and other targets of these campaigns, it is especially galling that the abuse is apparently endorsed by prominent Modi allies. Ayyub showed me a tweet about the porn video from Vaibhav Aggarwal, a media personality who often speaks on behalf of the B.J.P. It read, \u201cU want to dance in the Rain, get all wet & not want to then have pneumonia\u201d\u2014a suggestion that she deserved whatever abuse she got. In June, the fake Ayyub quote about child rape was retweeted by a prominent B.J.P. member named Ashoke Pandit. The quote, which originated in English, was translated into Hindi on a Facebook page for the so-called Army of Yogi Adityanath\u2014admirers of the B.J.P.\u2019s Chief Minister in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Pratik Sinha, a former software engineer and the founder of Alt News, which tracks online disinformation, described a nimble social-media operation that works on behalf of the B.J.P. In 2017, his group made a typical discovery, when a pro-B.J.P. Web site called Hindutva.info released a video of a gruesome stabbing, which was passed around on social media as evidence that Muslims were killing Hindus in Kerala. Puneet Sharma, an R.S.S. apparatchik whom Modi follows on Twitter, promoted the video, saying that it should make Hindus\u2019 \u201cblood boil.\u201d But, when Alt News tracked the video to its source, it turned out to depict a gang killing in Mexico. Sinha told me he believes that some of the most aggressive social-media posts are instigated by an unofficial \u201cI.T. cell,\u201d staffed and funded by B.J.P. loyalists. He said that people affiliated with the B.J.P. maintain Web sites that push pro-Modi propaganda and attack his enemies. \u201cThey are organized and quick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got their act down a long time ago, in Gujarat.\u201d As Modi consolidated his hold on the government, he used its power to silence mainstream outlets. In 2016, his administration began moving to crush the television news network NDTV. Since it went on the air, in 1988, the station has been one of the liveliest and most credible news channels; this spring, as votes were tallied in the general election, its Web site received 16.5 billion hits in a single day. According to two people familiar with the situation, Modi\u2019s administration has pulled nearly all government advertising from the network\u2014one of its primary sources of revenue\u2014and members of his Cabinet have pressured private companies to stop buying ads. NDTV recently laid off some four hundred employees, a quarter of its staff. The journalists who remain say that they don\u2019t know how long they can persist. \u201cThese are dark times,\u201d one told me. That year, Karan Thapar, the journalist who had asked Modi whether he wanted to express remorse for the Gujarat riots, found that no one from the B.J.P. would appear on his nightly show any longer. Thapar, perhaps the country\u2019s most prominent television journalist, was suddenly unable to meaningfully cover politics. Then he discovered that Modi\u2019s Cabinet members were pushing his bosses to take him off the air. \u201cThey make you toxic,\u201d Thapar told me. \u201cThese are not things that are put in writing. They\u2019re conversations\u2014\u2018We think it\u2019s not a good idea to have him around.\u2019 \u201d (His network, India Today, denies being influenced by \u201cexternal pressures.\u201d) In 2017, his employers expressed reluctance to renew his contract, so he left the network. Modi\u2019s government has targeted enterprising editors as well. Last year, Bobby Ghosh, the editor of the Hindustan Times, one of the country\u2019s most respected newspapers, ran a series tracking violence against Muslims. Modi met privately with the Times\u2019 owner, and the next day Ghosh was asked to leave. In 2016, Outlook ran a disturbing investigation by Neha Dixit, revealing that the R.S.S. had offered schooling to dozens of disadvantaged children in the state of Assam, and then sent them to be indoctrinated in Hindu-nationalist camps on the other side of the country. According to a person with knowledge of the situation, Outlook\u2019s owners\u2014one of India\u2019s wealthiest families, whose businesses depended on government approvals\u2014came under pressure from Modi\u2019s administration. \u201cThey were going to ruin their empire,\u201d the person said. Not long after, Krishna Prasad, Outlook\u2019s longtime editor, resigned. Both Ayyub and Dixit said that no mainstream publication would sponsor their work. \u201cSo many of the really good reporters in India are freelance,\u201d Ayyub told me. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d Even news that ought to cause scandal has little effect. In June, the Business Standard reported that Modi\u2019s government had been inflating G.D.P.-growth figures by a factor of nearly two. The report prompted a public outcry, but Modi did not apologize, and no official was forced to resign. Only a few small outfits regularly offer aggressive coverage. The most prominent of them, The Caravan and a news site called the Wire, employ a total of about seventy journalists\u2014barely enough to cover a large city, let alone a country of more than a billion people. In 2017, after the Wire ran a story examining questionable business dealings by Amit Shah\u2019s son, Modi\u2019s ministers began pressuring donors who sustain the site to stop providing funding. Shah\u2019s son, who denied the allegations, also filed a lawsuit, which has been costly to defend. Siddharth Varadarajan, the site\u2019s founding editor, told me that he is battling not only the government but also the compliant media. \u201cWe reckon that people in this country very much value their freedoms and democracy\u2014and that they will realize when their freedoms are being eroded,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a huge section of the media is busy telling them something entirely different.\u201d", "Modi\u2019s supporters often get their news from Republic TV, which features shouting matches, public shamings, and scathing insults of all but the most slavish Modi partisans; next to it, Fox News resembles the BBC\u2019s \u201cNewshour.\u201d Founded in 2017 with B.J.P. support, Republic TV stars Arnab Goswami, a floppy-haired Oxford graduate who acts as a kind of public scourge for opponents of Modi\u2019s initiatives. In a typical program, from 2017, Goswami mentioned a law mandating that movie theatres play the national anthem, and asked whether people should be required to stand; his guest Waris Pathan, a Muslim assemblyman, argued that it should be a matter of choice. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you stand up?\u201d Goswami shouted at Pathan. Before Pathan could get out an answer, he yelled again, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you stand up? What\u2019s your problem with it?\u201d Pathan kept trying, but Goswami, his hair flying, shouted over him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why, because\u2014I\u2019ll tell you why. I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll tell you why. Can I tell you? Then why don\u2019t you stop, and I\u2019ll tell you why? Don\u2019t be an anti-national! Don\u2019t be an anti-national! Don\u2019t be an anti-national!\u201d The lack of journalistic scrutiny has given Modi immense freedom to control the narrative. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the months leading up to his re\u00eblection, in 2019. Backed by his allies in business, Modi ran a campaign that was said to cost some five billion dollars. (Its exact cost is unknown, owing to weak campaign-finance laws.) As the vote approached, though, Modi was losing momentum, hampered by an underperforming economy. On February 14th, a suicide bomber crashed a car laden with explosives into an Indian military convoy in Kashmir, killing forty soldiers. The attack energized Modi: he gave a series of bellicose speeches, insisting, \u201cThe blood of the people is boiling!\u201d He blamed the attack on Pakistan, India\u2019s archrival, and sent thousands of troops into Kashmir. The B.J.P.\u2019s supporters launched a social-media blitz, attacking Pakistan and hailing Modi as \u201ca tiger.\u201d One viral social-media post contained a telephone recording of Modi consoling a widow; it turned out that the recording had been made in 2013. On February 26th, Modi ordered air strikes against what he claimed was a training camp for militants in the town of Balakot. Sympathetic outlets described a momentous victory: they pumped out images of a devastated landscape, and, citing official sources, claimed that three hundred militants had been killed. But Western reporters visiting the site found no evidence of any deaths; there were only a handful of craters, a slightly damaged house, and some fallen trees. Many of the pro-Modi posts turned out to be crude fabrications. Pratik Sinha, of Alt News, pointed out that photos claiming to depict dead Pakistani militants actually showed victims of a heat wave; other images, ostensibly of the strikes, were cribbed from a video game called Arma 2. \u201cI know I should have gotten a cart, but I can\u2019t give up now.\u201d Cartoon by Caitlin Cass But, in a country where hundreds of millions of people are illiterate or nearly so, the big idea got through. Modi rose in the polls and coasted to victory. The B.J.P. won a majority in the lower house of parliament, making Modi the most powerful Prime Minister in decades. Amit Shah, Modi\u2019s deputy, told a group of election workers that the Party\u2019s social-media networks were an unstoppable force. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are capable of delivering any message we want to the public\u2014whether sweet or sour, true or fake.\u201d For many, Modi\u2019s re\u00eblection suggested that he had uncovered a terrible secret at the heart of Indian society: by deploying vicious sectarian rhetoric, the country\u2019s leader could persuade Hindus to give him nearly unchecked power. In the following months, Modi\u2019s government introduced a series of extraordinary initiatives meant to solidify Hindu dominance. The most notable of them, along with revoking the special status of Kashmir, was a measure designed to strip citizenship from as many as two million residents of the state of Assam, many of whom had crossed the border from the Muslim nation of Bangladesh decades before. In September, the government began constructing detention centers for residents who had become illegal overnight. A feeling of despair has settled in among many Indians who remain committed to the secular, inclusive vision of the country\u2019s founders. \u201cGandhi and Nehru were great, historic figures, but I think they were an aberration,\u201d Prasad, the former Outlook editor, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s very different now. The institutions have crumbled\u2014universities, investigative agencies, the courts, the media, the administrative agencies, public services. And I think there is no rational answer for what has happened, except that we pretended to be what we were for fifty, sixty years. But we are now reverting to what we always wanted to be, which is to pummel minorities, to push them into a corner, to show them their places, to conquer Kashmir, to ruin the media, and to make corporations servants of the state. And all of this under a heavy resurgence of Hinduism. India is becoming the country it has always wanted to be.\u201d", "On March 31, 2017, a Muslim dairy farmer named Pehlu Khan drove to the city of Jaipur with several relatives, to buy a pair of cows for his business. On the way home, a line of men blocked the road, surrounded his truck, and accused him of planning to sell the cows for meat. Cows are considered sacred by Hindus, and most Indian states forbid killing them. But it is generally legal to eat beef from cows that have died naturally, and to make leather from their hide\u2014jobs often performed by Muslims and lower-caste Hindus, leaving them open to false accusations. The men pulled Khan and his relatives from the truck and began beating them and shouting anti-Muslim epithets. \u201cWe showed them our papers for the cow purchase, but it did not matter,\u201d Ajmat, a nephew, said. Khan was taken to a hospital, where he died soon afterward. Khan\u2019s relatives identified nine attackers. Most of them were members of Bajrang Dal, a branch of the R.S.S. Ostensibly a youth group, Bajrang Dal often provides muscle and security for B.J.P. members. It has also been implicated in a rash of murders of Muslims throughout the country. In Jaipur, I met Ashok Singh, the head of the Rajasthan chapter of Bajrang Dal. Singh told me that he and his men were duty-bound to defend cows from an epidemic of theft and killing. For several minutes, he spoke about the holiness of the cow. Each animal, he said, contains three hundred and sixty million gods, and even its dung has elixirs beneficial to humans. \u201cThey cut them, they kill them,\u201d Singh said of Muslims. \u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy.\u201d He admitted that Bajrang Dal members had taken part in stopping Khan, but he insisted that other people had committed the murder. \u201cThere was a mob,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have control of it.\u201d The attackers identified by Khan\u2019s relatives were arrested and charged, but local sentiment ran strongly in their favor. After the prosecutor declined to introduce any eyewitness testimony or cell-phone videos into evidence, all the attackers were acquitted. \u201cThe case was rigged,\u201d Kasim Khan, a lawyer for the family, told me. \u201cThe outcome was decided before the trial.\u201d According to FactChecker, an organization that tracks communal violence by surveying media reports, there have been almost three hundred hate crimes motivated by religion in the past decade\u2014almost all of them since Modi became Prime Minister. Hindu mobs have killed dozens of Muslim men. The murders, which are often instigated by Bajrang Dal members, have become known as \u201clynchings,\u201d evoking the terror that swept the American South after Reconstruction. The lynchings take place against a backdrop of hysteria created by the R.S.S. and its allies\u2014a paranoid narrative of a vast majority, nearly a billion strong, being victimized by a much smaller minority. When Muslims are lynched, Modi typically says nothing, and, since he rarely holds press conferences, he is almost never asked about them. But his supporters often salute the killers. In June, 2017, a Muslim man named Alimuddin Ansari, who was accused of cow trafficking, was beaten to death in the village of Ramgarh. Eleven men, including a local leader of the B.J.P., were convicted of murder, but last July they were freed, pending appeal. On their release, eight of them were met by Jayant Sinha, the B.J.P. Minister for Civil Aviation. Sinha, a Harvard graduate and a former consultant for McKinsey & Company, draped the men in marigold garlands and presented them with sweets. \u201cAll I am doing is honoring the due process of law,\u201d he said at the time. In northern India, Hindu nationalists have whipped up panic around the idea that Muslim men are engaging in a secret campaign to seduce Hindu women into marriage and prostitution. As with the hysteria over cow killings, the furor takes form mostly on social media and platforms like WhatsApp, where rumors spread indiscriminately. The idea\u2014known as \u201clove jihad\u201d\u2014is rooted in an image of the oversexed Muslim male, fortified by beef and preying on desirable Hindu women. In many areas, any Muslim man seen with a Hindu woman risks being attacked. Two years ago, Yogi Adityanath, the B.J.P. Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, set up \u201canti-Romeo squads,\u201d which harassed Muslim men believed to be trying to seduce Hindu women. The squads were abandoned after the gangs mistakenly beat up several Hindu men. In a village in Haryana, I spoke with a young Hindu woman named Ayesha. A year before, she had met a Muslim man named Omar, a purveyor of spiritual medicine who had been visiting her home to treat her mother. They fell in love, and decided that Ayesha would convert to Islam and they would get married. Her family was horrified, she said. One night, Ayesha ran off with Omar to his village, a few miles away, where they got married in a mosque, and moved in with his relatives. For several months, Ayesha said, her family tried to persuade her to get a divorce; at one point, her father brought her a pistol and a suicide note to sign. \u201cI was so sad, I almost agreed,\u201d she said. One night, as Omar rode his bicycle, two men followed on scooters. One of them pulled out a gun and shot Omar dead. Ayesha remained with Omar\u2019s family, saying she will never go back to her own. \u201cI am one hundred per cent certain that my family is responsible for my husband\u2019s death,\u201d she said.", "When Ayyub was a child, a group of men gathered every morning for prayer and martial arts in a field down the street from her home. The men formed a local chapter of the R.S.S., and sometimes chanted slogans celebrating Hindu supremacy: \u201cHail, Mother India.\u201d The men were friendly, she recalled\u2014eager to recruit Muslims. But she had learned in school that an R.S.S. acolyte had killed Gandhi, so she and her brother, Aref, kept their distance. \u201cWe would watch with fascination,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t like being there.\u201d Early one morning in Ahmedabad, on a playground at Ellisbridge Municipal School No. 12, I looked on as a dozen men raised the saffron flag of the R.S.S. They ranged in age from eighteen to sixty-three, and were all trim and fit, many of them wearing the group\u2019s signature khaki shorts. They began with yoga poses and calisthenics. Then they took out long wooden rods and began to perform martial exercises. (An R.S.S. chief once said that the group\u2019s cadres could be assembled to fight more quickly than the Indian Army.) The men moved together, stepping and striking in formation. \u201cOne-two-three-four, one-two-three-four,\u201d their leader cried. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re an expert\u2014I\u2019m seeing a lot of mistakes.\u201d The men finished in a semicircle on the ground, offering prayers to the Hindu sun god: \u201cO Surya, the shining one, the radiant one, dispeller of darkness, source of life.\u201d They ended by shouting, \u201cVictory to India!\u201d Afterward, the men\u2014who included an engineer, a lawyer, a garment merchant, and a police officer\u2014laughed and clapped one another on the back. Together they made up the Paldi chapter of the R.S.S., one of more than thirty thousand across India. Paldi is an overwhelmingly Hindu neighborhood, but the nearest Muslim enclave, which came under attack in 2002, is less than a mile away. On this morning, there wasn\u2019t much talk of politics. \u201cI\u2019m just here to stay fit,\u201d Nehal Burasin, a student, told me. For a fuller explanation of the R.S.S.\u2019s world view, I spoke to Sudhanshu Trivedi, a lifelong member who is now the B.J.P.\u2019s national spokesman. Over dinner at the Ambassador Hotel in Delhi, Trivedi told me that the R.S.S. is dedicated to the propagation of \u201cHindutva\u201d: the idea that India is first and foremost a nation for Hindus. It is, he said, by far the largest organization of its kind in the world. In its ninety-four-year existence, the R.S.S. has embedded itself in every aspect of Indian society. Between bites of salad, Trivedi rattled off R.S.S. talking points. The organization says that it runs some thirty thousand primary and secondary schools; that it administers hospitals across India, especially in remote areas; and that it maintains the second-largest network of trade unions in the country, the largest network of farmers, the largest social-welfare organization working in the slums. The B.J.P., India\u2019s dominant political party, came last in his litany. \u201cSo, you can see, in the entire scheme of things, compared to what the R.S.S. is doing, what the B.J.P. is doing is small,\u201d he said. In fact, the R.S.S. was rapidly becoming a state within a state\u2014capturing India from within. Over the summer, the organization announced that it was establishing a school to train young people to become officers in the armed forces. This year, more than a hundred and fifty former officers and enlisted men signed a letter decrying the \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d use of the military for political purposes. They referred to Modi\u2019s taking credit for the cross-border strikes in Pakistan, and to the boast by some B.J.P. politicians that it was \u201cModi\u2019s army.\u201d The key to understanding modern India, Trivedi told me, was accepting that \u201cHinduism is not basically a religion\u2014it is a way of life.\u201d Anyone born in India is part of Hinduism. Therefore, all the other religions found in India thrive because of Hinduism, and are subordinate to it. \u201cThe culture of Islam is preserved here because of Hindu civilization,\u201d he said. Cartoon by Liana Finck As part of the Hindutva project, B.J.P. leaders have been rewriting school textbooks across the country, erasing much of its Islamic history, including that of the Mughals, Muslim emperors who ruled India for three centuries. The B.J.P. has changed Mughal place names to ones that are Hindu-influenced. Last year, the Mughalsarai railway station, built in central India a century and a half ago, was renamed for Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, a right-wing Hindu-nationalist leader. Allahabad, a city of more than a million people, is now called Prayagraj, a Sanskrit word that denotes a place of sacrifice. In November, the old story of Ayodhya was in the news again, when India\u2019s Supreme Court cleared the way for a Hindu temple to be constructed on the former site of Babri Masjid. In a thousand-page decision, the Court provided no evidence that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque, and acknowledged that the mosque had been torn down by an angry mob. Nevertheless, it handed control of the land to a government trust, effectively allowing the B.J.P. to proceed. Trivedi told me that no one in the R.S.S. bore any animus toward Islam. But, he said, it was important to understand just how far the faith had fallen. \u201cIn India, the most educated community is the Parsis, which is a minority. The second most educated is the Christians, which is a minority. The most prosperous is the Jains, which is a minority. The most entrepreneurial is Sikh, which is a minority. The first nuclear scientist in India was a Parsi\u2014a minority,\u201d he said. \u201cThen what is the problem with Muslims? I will tell you. They have become captives of the jihadi ideology.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india", "id": "26e25f9a-f17a-3fbd-a9d6-a45999630731", "title": "Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi\u2019s India", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Dexter Filkins", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "As the reports cycled through the news, the journalist Rana Ayyub told me over the phone that she was heading to Kashmir.\nElsewhere in India, the B.J.P.\u2019s fortunes were sinking; as a result, Modi\u2019s hard-line faction was able to seize the Party leadership.\nThe truth would never come out.\u201d He told Ayyub to go forward.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the resources to think about all that,\u201d Ayyub told me.\n\u201cSo many of the really good reporters in India are freelance,\u201d Ayyub told me.", "pubDate": null}
