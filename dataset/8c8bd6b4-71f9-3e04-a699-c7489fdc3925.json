The run of movies that he\u2019s made in the past ten years\u2014\u201cThe Tree of Life,\u201d \u201cTo the Wonder,\u201d \u201cKnight of Cups,\u201d and \u201cSong to Song\u201d\u2014is, in effect, a single movie, ranging over the places and experiences of his life and linking them to a grand metaphysical design. He is, moreover, one of the few filmmakers\u2014ever\u2014to realize a style that matches such a transcendent goal. Yet, when I heard that the subject of Malick\u2019s new film, \u201cA Hidden Life,\u201d would be the story of an Austrian soldier who refuses to fight on behalf of Nazi Germany, I worried. Malick\u2019s recent string of glories focusses on places that he knows well and at first hand. He has spent plenty of time in Texas, France, and Hollywood, but he has, of course, never been to Nazi Germany. Even so, I walked into \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d buoyed by confidence in the impulses and intuitions of such a great director.", "It\u2019s painful to discover that \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d is as aridly theoretical and impersonal as its bare-bones description suggests. It\u2019s based on the true story of Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter (August Diehl), an Austrian farmer living peacefully in the rustic farm village of Radegund with his wife, Fani (Valerie Pachner), their three young daughters, her sister (Maria Simon), and his mother (Karin Neuh\u00e4user). In 1940, he\u2019s conscripted into the Army\u2014at a time when Austrian soldiers, in the wake of the Anschluss, were forced to swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler. Franz doesn\u2019t believe in the Nazi cause or agree with its racial hatreds. He thinks that Germany is waging an unjust war, and he doesn\u2019t like Hitler. He shows up for military duty grudgingly but refuses to swear the oath, claiming conscientious-objector status, and is consequently arrested and imprisoned. Meanwhile, his outsider status\u2014as other men in the village have gone off to fight and die\u2014leads to Fani and their children being ostracized, apart from the secret support of a few friends who share Franz\u2019s sympathies but not his resolve or courage.", "The movie includes heavily edited illustrative clips from newsreel footage, showing the destruction of the Second World War, Hitler giving speeches, and Nazi rallies. These clips present both a mystery and an authenticity that nothing in the rest of the film can match. For that matter, clips from home movies of Hitler appear, appallingly, as part of a dream sequence, but they seem tossed in, mainly serving as a reminder of Hitler\u2019s ubiquity at the time. This historical footage overwhelms the entire movie, turning the dramatization into a virtual puppet show.", "Franz and Fani are seen romping through the fields of Radegund, like blissfully ignorant children, until the lightning bolt of the military draft strikes their household, in 1940, two years after the Anschluss and seven years after Hitler came to power. It\u2019s as if politics and its cultural and local correlates had never existed in Austria. The townspeople appear to have been living like Rousseauian innocents, in a state of natural nobility tinged by a golden drop of Catholicism\u2014happy, safe, and holy. Their village is a hermetic, apolitical, and utterly pre-modern agrarian paradise. The first sign of trouble, ludicrously, is the sound of an airplane overhead, which makes Fani tilt her head upward in bewilderment.", "Meanwhile, the village\u2019s committed Nazi mayor (Karl Markovics) drunkenly rails against \u201coutsiders\u201d and \u201cimmigrants\u201d\u2014but did he and his hatreds suddenly come from nowhere? Austrian politics throughout the nineteen-thirties were turbulent, and the Anschluss happened in 1938, yet it seems that politics didn\u2019t penetrate the village\u2019s rustic fabric until the draft snapped up Franz, in 1940\u2014and, even then, he takes his conscription and training as a sort of summer-camp game (though he is conspicuously alone among recruits in not applauding a newsreel of German military victories). Returning home, Franz worries about the possibility of being called to active duty; he refuses to say \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d to passersby. (His response of \u201cPfui Hitler\u201d gets him into trouble.) Then, in 1943, he is asked to report to the barracks for active duty; that\u2019s when he refuses to swear the oath to Hitler.", "The familiar freedom of Malick\u2019s rhapsodic cinematography is here largely sacrificed to illustrative and indicative images (the cinematographer is J\u00f6rg Widmer, who was a camera operator on several of Malick\u2019s earlier films) and the acting is constrained to match, reduced to facile theatrics and superficial expressions, smiling and frowning, gleeful frolics and heavy trudges. Before the trouble strikes, family happiness is shown in the carefree laughter of a game of blind man\u2019s bluff, the ardent young couple romps in the fields while cutting hay or travelling a farm road. The natural splendors of Radegund are postcard-like; the plunging and surging camera work is merely a tic. More or less every shot represents a descriptive line in a screenplay rather than a free observation or a distillation of inner experience; each image checks off predetermined points rather than effecting discoveries.", "The entire movie seems designed to illustrate a thesis, one that\u2019s explicitly stated in the film, albeit inversely. \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d is designed solely to contradict the warning of Nazi officials that Franz\u2019s resistance is futile, not only because he\u2019ll be executed but because his sacrifice will be forgotten and remain unknown and without effect or influence. By the very fact of making the film, Malick both remembers the story and calls it to viewers\u2019 minds\u2014though he isn\u2019t the single-handed recoverer of an otherwise-lost historical event. The letters between the real-life Franz and Fani have survived and have been published, and they provide the basis for the film (as well as the texts for some of its voice-overs). Malick is transmitting a story of which powerful documentary traces remain. What\u2019s missing from his depiction of Franz\u2019s resistance is literally the documentary aspect, the element of the story that connects it directly to Malick\u2019s first-person obsessions.", "It is Malick\u2019s extreme and original approach, in his past decade of work, to experience and observation that has led to his furiously lyrical transcendental style. The present-tense-based dramatizations that, when they involve Malick\u2019s own life and his own places, people, and activities, have been so comprehensively challenging, prove, in \u201cA Hidden Life,\u201d vague, impersonal, and complacent. Malick has turned his own idiosyncratic manner into a commonplace, a convention, a habit. There\u2019s one moment in which Malick declares something like an artistic purpose\u2014a scene in which an artist painting scenes from the life of Christ on the walls of the local church complains to Franz of his own inadequate work as a painter of consolation rather than of torment, of reverence rather than of sacrifice. (The artist also alludes to the vain confidence of parishioners that they\u2019d have stood with Jesus rather than with his persecutors\u2014a line that hits Franz like a challenge.) Malick stands on both sides of the equation: he offers images of earthly rapture, suggesting the virtual paradise given to humanity, and he also offers images of torment and agony, suggesting the spoliation, through sin, with which humanity has besmirched that paradise.", "Yet in \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d Malick\u2019s merely illustrative and forcedly expressive approach to his subject\u2014complete with studio Nazis from Central Casting (who bark in German, while Franz and Fani speak to each other in English), shots of natural splendor that are numbingly nonspecific and pictorial, and performances that leave no room for ambiguity, contemplation, or mere presence\u2014culminates in a sequence of heavily intended exaltation, a death scene of such leaden bombast and overwrought vagueness as to turn its sacred simplicity into a self-parody. The representation of the torments that Franz endures in the course of his years of opposition and months of imprisonment\u2014which fill nearly two hours of screen time\u2014has the arm\u2019s-length glorification of suffering, the revelling in agony, that marks Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ.\u201d", "A central problem with \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d is in the resistance of Nazis to fictional depiction. Some of the very worst movies of recent years have used depictions Nazis in the Second World War as a shortcut to gravitas, starting with this year\u2019s garish grotesquerie \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d and including last year\u2019s \u201cMemoir of War\u201d and \u201cThe Captain.\u201d Now there\u2019s news that Jonathan Glazer, best known for the science-fiction thriller \u201cUnder the Skin,\u201d from 2013, is making another feature, his first since then\u2014a drama set in Auschwitz. I worry for him, too.", "I\u2019d like to make a suggestion: de-Nazify the cinema. Filmmakers who make movies about the Second World War, with a closeup view of Nazi Germany and its occupying forces, do so mainly with high-stakes metaphors and storytelling in mind\u2014using the era to illustrate the ultimate clash of good and evil, the ultimate price of resistance. Few filmmakers who make movies about Nazi Germany have a good reason to do so; most dramatic movies on the subject approach it emblematically, with Nazis as instant avatars of evil, posing a special moral challenge to characters that proves irresistible to screenwriters in need of a fix of high-stakes conflict and moral high ground (and, perhaps, of irresistibly lurid villains or ironic paradoxes) and producers who find the starkness of such choices sensational.", "It\u2019s Steven Spielberg\u2019s fault: he paved the way to Oskars with \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d a banalization of such appalling success as to turn Nazi Germany into a virtual synonym for cinematic seriousness. His many emulators have similarly pursued the transformation of Nazi stories into melodrama and, in the process, elided their own relation to that history\u2014and to the role of that historical subject in the present time. Rather, in a de-Nazified cinema, movies about Nazi Germany, whether dramatic or documentary, would make the investigation of the past a subject in itself. In making filmmakers\u2019 positions clear, such movies would pose the question why Hitler and Nazi Germany continue to exert such a grip on modern life. (It would have been a more daring act of memory, of active commemoration, of rescue from oblivion, for Malick to film himself sitting at a table and reading aloud from the J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tters\u2019 letters than to film a drama based on them.) This proposal wouldn\u2019t preclude fiction; some of the best recent fictional movies earn their fidelity to the past by way of the filmmakers\u2019 fidelity to their own experience, the authenticity of their effort to discern and understand the past from their current perspective. Filmmakers should simply discard the practice of using Nazis as a ready-made metaphor rather than as a specific experience of such enormity that it defies understanding nearly a century later. In doing so, they\u2019d be reinventing the art, and their own artistry, to meet the subject\u2019s demands."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/when-bad-nazis-happen-to-good-directors-terrence-malicks-a-hidden-life", "id": "8c8bd6b4-71f9-3e04-a699-c7489fdc3925", "title": "When Bad Nazis Happen to Good Directors: Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Richard Brody", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "He has spent plenty of time in Texas, France, and Hollywood, but he has, of course, never been to Nazi Germany.\nEven so, I walked into \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d buoyed by confidence in the impulses and intuitions of such a great director.\nIt\u2019s painful to discover that \u201cA Hidden Life\u201d is as aridly theoretical and impersonal as its bare-bones description suggests.\nThe present-tense-based dramatizations that, when they involve Malick\u2019s own life and his own places, people, and activities, have been so comprehensively challenging, prove, in \u201cA Hidden Life,\u201d vague, impersonal, and complacent.\nRather, in a de-Nazified cinema, movies about Nazi Germany, whether dramatic or documentary, would make the investigation of the past a subject in itself.", "pubDate": null}
