In one skirmish in 2015, the University of Tennessee offered guidance on referring to non-binary students on its website, only for political blowback to lead to a legislative ban on spending public money to support non-traditional pronouns. Jordan Peterson, a controversial Canadian academic, has refused to use invented pronouns or \u201cthey\u201d in relation to people who identify as neither male nor female. Many fulminating commentators spy political correctness running amok yet again.", "Into the breach comes a useful corrective in the form of Dennis Baron\u2019s well-timed new book, \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Pronoun?\u201d Mr Baron is a linguist at the University of Illinois, and a longtime scholar of a curious gap in the English language. For centuries, people have wrestled with the fact that there is no uncontroversial pronoun to refer to a subject of unknown, indeterminate or mixed gender.", "Singular they, in sentences such as \u201cEveryone loves their mother\u201d, has been derided as incorrect for a long time. Mr Baron tracks the first such ruling to a 16th-century Latin grammar, which declared the masculine the more honourable gender that, where necessary, encompasses the feminine. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this view made its way into English grammars: when referring to a generic person, you should say \u201cEveryone loves his mother.\u201d", "But there were wide holes in this argument. Proponents of the rule treated it as a simple matter of grammatical agreement: everyone is grammatically singular, so requires a singular pronoun. They is plural and won\u2019t do. To real sticklers for agreement, however, pronouns must tally in both number and gender. Generic they is wrong by number, but generic he is wrong by gender.", "Nonetheless, \u201che includes she\u201d was in textbooks, and so, for a time, proto-feminists tried to take advantage where they could. Laws saying that each person should pay \u201chis\u201d taxes required women to pay, too. So, 19th-century suffragists reasoned, the statute books referring to a generic voter as \u201che\u201d gave women the right to vote. Seemingly hoist on the chauvinist petard, defenders of male-only suffrage tactically retreated: he included she unless it would produce an \u201cabsurd\u201d reading\u2014such as offering women the vote. (Since it was often held that husbands voted in their wives\u2019 interests, Susan B. Anthony, a 19th-century American suffragist, suggested that if a woman commits murder her husband should be hanged in her stead.)", "Given the problems with he, lots of people have invented new, gender-free pronouns. The first one Mr Baron could find (of more than 250 in total) dates to 1841: E. Other suggestions continue in a steady stream until today. Every once in a while, one found a tiny purchase. In 1884 three dictionaries included thon, shortened from that one, but it failed to catch on. The Sacramento Bee, a newspaper, said in 1920 that it would use hir in place of \u201che or she\u201d, and did so sporadically until the 1940s, but it too faded away.", "The \u201cmissing word\u201d, Mr Baron says, is \u201cthey\u201d. People have been using it as a generic singular in writing since at least 1375, and have doubtless been saying it even longer. It has appeared as such in the King James Bible, the works of Shakespeare and the novels of Jane Austen. Recently, growing numbers of style guides, including those of The Economist and the Associated Press as well as the Chicago Manual of Style, have concluded that it is often the most pragmatic of a set of imperfect solutions.", "But all that comes as a different singular they has come to the fore: to refer to a known individual who identifies as non-binary, as growing numbers do, in sentences such as \u201cAlex forgot their keys.\u201d This is the increasingly widespread singular they that was recently recognised by the American Dialect Society as its Word of the Decade.", "The two usages are quite different. The one in \u201cEveryone has their own opinion\u201d is actually quite conservative, given its age, its literary pedigree and the fact that most people already say it in casual speech. They in \u201cAlex forgot their keys\u201d is, by contrast, innovative and jarring to many; for the uninitiated, it takes practice to use it consistently. And though both feminists and transgender activists have embraced the singular they, they have done so for different reasons, and other issues still divide them. A rare moment of liberation through grammar risks being caught up in wider, rancorous culture wars."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["wrong", "mr", "johnson", "singular", "pronoun", "different", "pronouns", "referring", "women", "baron", "think", "generic"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
