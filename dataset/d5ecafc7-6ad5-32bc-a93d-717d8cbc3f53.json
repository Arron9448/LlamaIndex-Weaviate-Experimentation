Its unnamed narrator is a solitary Roman woman \u2014 though Rome is never mentioned \u2014 who recounts her few excursions in brief chapters. Lahiri offers readers glimpses of the woman at the pool (\u201cIn that container of clear water lacking life or current I see the same people with whom, for whatever reason, I feel a connection\u201d), herded unexpectedly into a guided tour (\u201cI\u2019m caught in the charade, I play a part in it, albeit as an extra\u201d), eating a sandwich in a playground (\u201cAs I eat it, my body bakes in the sun that pours down on my neighborhood, each bite, feeling sacred, reminds me that I\u2019m not forsaken\u201d).", "Other characters appear \u2014 her therapist, her mother, a friend \u2014 yet the interactions reinforce the narrator\u2019s isolation. \u201cSolitude: It\u2019s become my trade,\u201d she tells herself.", "Alessandro Giammei, an assistant professor of Italian at Bryn Mawr and a former colleague of Lahiri\u2019s, was an early reader of both the Italian and English versions. In \u201cDove Mi Trovo,\u201d he was struck by the elegance of the language and the precision of Lahiri\u2019s word choices. \u201cYou cannot read this book without moving your mouth in Italian,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThe incredible detail of her observational writing that is classic Jhumpa Lahiri is not in \u2018Whereabouts,\u2019\u201d Giammei said. If, in English, Lahiri is an eye, he added, \u201cin Italian, she\u2019s an ear.\u201d", "Lahiri began drafting \u201cWhereabouts\u201d in 2015, after the Italian version of \u201cIn Other Words\u201d had been released. It began as a series of sketches, scenes she\u2019d jot down in a notebook. By the time she could see them coming together in a book, she had moved to the United States for the job at Princeton, but she returned frequently to Rome, writing more sequences with each visit.", "\u201cThe Italian was like a faucet back then,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would only work when I was there.\u201d", "Apart from her own writing \u2014 \u201cWhereabouts\u201d is the third book she composed in Italian, following \u201cIn Other Words\u201d and \u201cThe Clothing of Books,\u201d published in 2016 \u2014 Lahiri kept busy with other translations and editing projects. She has translated two novels by an acclaimed contemporary writer, Domenico Starnone, one of which was a finalist for a National Book Award, and has a third set for release in the fall. Dismayed by the lack of quality translations of some of her favorite Italian writers, she edited and contributed translations to a volume of collected short stories. Several of those selections, including stories by Elsa Morante and Fabrizia Ramondino, had never before appeared in English."], "authors": ["Joumana Khatib"], "keywords": ["italian", "jhumpa", "writing", "book", "rome", "voice", "words", "english", "whereabouts", "translations", "lahiri", "woman"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
