The protesters were egged on by Mr Trump. Rather than condemn the violence he said they were \u201cvery special\u201d. Mr Biden\u2019s win was eventually confirmed by Congress. Earlier, ten former secretaries of defence, including Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, felt it necessary to write an open letter reminding the armed forces of their \u201csolemn obligations\u201d to support the constitution.

He is the first black Democrat from the South to hold a Senate seat, and only the 11th black senator overall. See article.", "A judge in Britain refused America\u2019s extradition request for Julian Assange, finding that the founder of WikiLeaks is at risk of committing suicide. America\u2019s Justice Department will appeal against the ruling, noting that the court had accepted all the legal points it had raised about Mr Assange\u2019s leaking of classified material.

Schools were shut down, a day after Boris Johnson, the prime minister, insisted they were safe. Mr Johnson also cancelled school academic exams this summer, but forgot about the vocational exams taking place this month. The minister in charge left the decision on whether to hold these assessments in subjects such as health and social care to the institutions themselves, creating more confusion. See article.", "There was increasing concern within the European Union that vaccination programmes have got off to a slow start. Although Britain has injected around 1.5% of its population already, Germany has administered merely 317,000 jabs, or 0.4% of its people. France did not break the 1,000 mark until January 4th. The Netherlands did not start vaccinations until January 6th. Many blame the European Commission\u2019s centralised procurement system for vaccines, though national delivery systems are plainly also at fault.

The four countries imposed an embargo on Qatar over its ties to Iran and Islamists, and the content of its Al Jazeera media network. Saudi Arabia has already reopened its borders with the emirate. See article.", "Iran said it would begin enriching uranium to 20% purity, short of the 90% required to make a nuclear bomb, but in breach of the deal it signed with world powers in 2015. It also raised tensions by seizing a South Korean tanker for \u201cpolluting the Persian Gulf\u201d.

It also cleared Covaxin, a vaccine developed by an Indian company that is still in the clinical-trial stage. A national lockdown in Germany was extended by three weeks, to January 31st. Strict curbs on travel were imposed in areas with the highest infection rates. Israel continued to lead the world in vaccination per person, inoculating 16% of its people by January 5th.
