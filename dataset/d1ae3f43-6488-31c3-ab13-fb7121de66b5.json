You can blame the Indian challengers for Narendra Modi, the Brazilian opposition for Jair Bolsonaro, and left and centre parties in Australia, the Philippines, Hungary, Poland and Turkey for similar electoral disasters. Or you could recognise that what we are witnessing is a global phenomenon.", "Yes, there were individual failings in all these cases, though the failings were very different: polar opposites in the cases of Corbyn and Clinton. But when the same thing happens in many nations, it\u2019s time to recognise the pattern, and see that heaping blame on particular people and parties fixes nothing.", "In these nations, people you wouldn\u2019t trust to post a letter for you have been elected to the highest office. There, as widely predicted, they behave like a gang of vandals given the keys to an art gallery, \u201cimproving\u201d the great works in their care with spray cans, box cutters and lump hammers. In the midst of global emergencies, they rip down environmental protections and climate agreements, and trash the regulations that constrain capital and defend the poor. They wage war on the institutions that are supposed to restrain their powers while, in some cases, committing extravagant and deliberate outrages against the rule of law. They use impunity as a political weapon, revelling in their ability to survive daily scandals, any one of which would destroy a normal politician.", "In 2014, Finland started a programme to counter fake news. The result is that Finns have been ranked the people most resistant to post-truth", "Something has changed: not just in the UK and the US, but in many parts of the world. A new politics, funded by oligarchs, built on sophisticated cheating and provocative lies, using dark ads and conspiracy theories on social media, has perfected the art of persuading the poor to vote for the interests of the very rich. We must understand what we are facing, and the new strategies required to resist it.", "If there is a formula for the new demagoguery, there must also be a formula for confronting and overturning it. I don\u2019t yet have a complete answer, but I believe there are some strands we can draw together.", "In Finland, on the day of our general election, Boris Johnson\u2019s antithesis became prime minister: the 34-year-old Sanna Marin, who is strong, humble and collaborative. Finland\u2019s politics, emerging from its peculiar history, cannot be replicated here. But there is one crucial lesson. In 2014, the country started a programme to counter fake news, teaching people how to recognise and confront it. The result is that Finns have been ranked, in a recent study of 35 nations, the people most resistant to post-truth politics.", "Don\u2019t expect Johnson\u2019s government, or Trump\u2019s, to inoculate people against their own lies. But this need not be a government initiative. This week, the US Democrats published a guide to confronting online disinformation. They will seek to hold Google, Facebook and Twitter to account. I would like to see progressive parties everywhere form a global coalition promoting digital literacy, and pressuring social media platforms to stop promoting falsehoods.", "But this is the less important task. The much bigger change is this: to stop seeking to control people from the centre. At the moment, the political model for almost all parties is to drive change from the top down. They write a manifesto, that they hope to turn into government policy, which may then be subject to a narrow and feeble consultation, which then leads to legislation, which then leads to change. I believe the best antidote to demagoguery is the opposite process: radical trust. To the greatest extent possible, parties and governments should trust communities to identify their own needs and make their own decisions.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The new Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, at the EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels. Photograph: Thierry Roge/Belga via ZUMA Press/Rex", "Over the past few years, our relationship with nature has begun to be transformed by a new approach: rewilding. Bizarre as this might sound, I believe this thinking could help inform a new model of politics. It is time for political rewilding.", "When you try to control nature from the top down, you find yourself in a constant battle with it. Conservation groups in this country often seek to treat complex living systems as if they were simple ones. Through intensive management \u2013 cutting, grazing and burning \u2013 they strive to beat nature into submission until it meets their idea of how it should behave. But ecologies, like all complex systems, are highly dynamic and adaptive, evolving (when allowed) in emergent and unpredictable ways.", "Eventually, and inevitably, these attempts at control fail. Nature reserves managed this way tend to lose abundance and diversity, and require ever more extreme intervention to meet the irrational demands of their stewards. They also become vulnerable. In all systems, complexity tends to be resilient, while simplicity tends to be fragile. Keeping nature in a state of arrested development in which most of its natural processes and its keystone species (the animals that drive these processes) are missing makes it highly susceptible to climate breakdown and invasive species. But rewilding \u2013 allowing dynamic, spontaneous organisation to reassert itself \u2013 can result in a sudden flourishing, often in completely unexpected ways, with a great improvement in resilience.", "The same applies to politics. Mainstream politics, controlled by party machines, has sought to reduce the phenomenal complexity of human society into a simple, linear model that can be controlled from the centre. The political and economic systems it creates are simultaneously highly unstable and lacking in dynamism; susceptible to collapse, as many northern towns can testify, while unable to regenerate themselves. They become vulnerable to the toxic, invasive forces of ethno-nationalism and supremacism.", "From the NHS to Brexit: what can we expect from Johnson's government? Read more", "But in some parts of the world, towns and cities have begun to rewild politics. Councils have catalysed mass participation, then \u2013 to the greatest extent possible \u2013 stepped back and allowed it to evolve. Classic examples include participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre in Brazil, the Decide Madrid system in Spain, and the Better Reykjavik programme in Iceland. Local people have reoccupied the political space that had been captured by party machines and top-down government. They have worked out together what their communities need and how to make it happen, refusing to let politicians frame the questions or determine the answers. The results have been extraordinary: a massive re-engagement in politics, particularly among marginalised groups, and dramatic improvements in local life. Participatory politics does not require the blessing of central government, just a confident and far-sighted local authority.", "Is this a formula for a particular party to regain power? No. It\u2019s much bigger than that. It\u2019s a formula for taking back control, making our communities more resilient and the machinations of any government in Westminster less relevant. This radical devolution is the best defence against capture by any political force. Let\u2019s change the nature of politics in this country. Let\u2019s allow the fascinating, unpredictable dynamics of a functioning society to emerge. Let the wild rumpus begin.", "\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["change", "trust", "control", "formula", "systems", "nature", "george", "parties", "called", "antidote", "monbiot", "politics", "political", "result", "rewilding", "demagoguery"], "id": "d1ae3f43-6488-31c3-ab13-fb7121de66b5", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["George Monbiot"], "title": "There is an antidote to demagoguery \u2013 it\u2019s called political rewilding | George Monbiot"}
