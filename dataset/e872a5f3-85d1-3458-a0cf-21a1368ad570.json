My god, we\u2019re talking about maybe 60 years ago. Yeah. \u201cThe Birds and The Beatles meet The Liverbirds from Merseyside, teenagers who have teamed up to try and break the male monopoly of the beat world. Boyfriends have had to have the brush-off, and the girls spend most of their spare time rehearsing.\u201d Well, we did. Yeah, of course we did. We did, every day after work. But I did have a boyfriend. And this was a good excuse, and I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t go out with you anymore, because I\u2019ve got to really concentrate on my music now.\u201d Oh, look. There\u2019s one here, that John Lennon said we\u2019d fail. Yeah. Liverpool, 1962. Everybody was playing music. People were saying, there\u2019s this fantastic band on, and they look great, and we\u2019ve got to go then to The Cavern and see them. I was 16. And I\u2019d never been to a concert or a dance before. It was so hot in there. It seemed as though the sweat was running down the walls. Just sitting there, waiting for them to come onstage. And then that was it \u2014 The Beatles. [MUSIC - THE BEATLES, \u2018SOME OTHER GUY\u2019] (SINGING) Some other guy is making me very \u2014 Oh, my god. I said to my cousins, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be like them. And we\u2019re going to be the first girls to do it.\u201d [MUSIC - THE BEATLES, \u2018SOME OTHER GUY\u2019] [CROWD CHEERING] I was born just after the war. So much of Liverpool had been damaged, and they hadn\u2019t managed to build new houses yet. Four children, my grandparents, and an uncle living in a three-bedroom apartment. I think about how sad it was, how cold it was in winter, because we had no heat. We\u2019d put coats on top of ourselves as well to keep us warm. The parish priest would just knock at the door every now and then. And when my mother opened the door, they\u2019d just give her an envelope and say, \u201cHere, Maggie. That\u2019s for you. Buy something that you need.\u201d I wanted to be a nun to pay back what they did for us one day and help all the people that were poor. But before that, I wanted to earn a lot of money to help my family to have a better life. So when I got home, I said to my parents, \u201cWe\u2019re going to start a girls\u2019 group.\u201d \u201cA group girl? What are you going to do there?\u201d And I said, \u201cPlay.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t play anything.\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got to learn.\u201d We went to Hessy\u2019s. We said, \u201cWe\u2019re starting a girls\u2019 group.\u201d And they said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d We just bought the guitars and the drums. Although we couldn\u2019t play a note between us. We started go into The Cavern with our guitars. Talking to other musicians, well, they all thought it was a great idea. Oh, my god, girl, isn\u2019t that crazy? But when are you going to start practicing? And we tried and said, \u201cOh, this is a lot harder than we thought it was going to be.\u201d [KNOCKING] [DOOR OPENS] And there were two girls outside the door. We said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Mary.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat you want off our Mary?\u201d We said, \u201cWell, can we speak to her? Because we believe she\u2019s got a band.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He said, \u201cMary!\u201d And Valerie, she was like the main one. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a band?\u201d \u201cOh, um.\u201d We knew it was a fraud. They couldn\u2019t play. We said, \u201cWe can\u2019t play.\u201d She said, \u201cBut you\u2019ve got the instruments.\u201d We said, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got the instruments.\u201d So Val said, \u201cLook, don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll teach you to play.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] Valerie was a very good musician. She had a very deep voice, long black hair with a fringe. There was something about her that made you be a bit frightened of her if you didn\u2019t know her properly. Mary, she was quite shy and sort of quiet, you know. I couldn\u2019t understand how she wanted to start a group and thing, because she was so quiet. And very religious. Oh, I was still going to be a nun. I was going to play in the group for a few years, earn a lot of money, and then be a nun. Very religious. Sylvia was always bubbly. - [LAUGHS] And Sylvia wanted to play guitar. But Sylvia\u2019s hands were too small. [LAUGHS] So I said, I\u2019ll get a kit of drums. My cousin left. And somebody said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s strange,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a girl here tonight. She\u2019s just told me that she\u2019s from Liverpool and she plays guitar.\u201d That was Pam. And we came up with Liverbirds, because that\u2019s the emblem of Liverpool. [MUSIC PLAYING] And on this one day, the compere Bob Wooler said, \u201cWould you like to come and meet The Beatles?\u201d Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So he took us into the dressing room. We had our guitars with us. It was just John Lennon and Paul McCartney. And he said, \u201cThis is The Liverbirds. They are going to be Liverpool\u2019s first all-female rock and roll band.\u201d And he turned around and he said to Mary, \u201cWhat\u2019s that? What have you got there in that case?\u201d So she said, \u201cA guitar.\u201d And John Lennon just looked at us and he said \u2014 [CHUCKLES] \u2014 \u201cGirls don\u2019t play guitars.\u201d And we thought, oh, god. We\u2019re going to show you. Then we practiced, and practiced, and practiced, and practiced. You have to do rudiments \u2014 mama, daddy, mama, daddy. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Mama, daddy, mama, daddy. And this gentleman came up to us, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you all bookings up and down the country.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give you all 7 pound a week.\u201d [CHA-CHING] Oh. We were ready to go on tour. [MUSIC PLAYING] We toured all over England. Playing all around different places. We were playing with a group called The Kinks. We did a few day tour with The Rolling Stones. We didn\u2019t have time for boys. Too busy. The four of us just belonged together. We were best friends. The Beatles came back, raving about the Star-Club in Hamburg. Now everybody wanted to go to the Star-Club in Hamburg. We wanted to be as famous as The Beatles. Why not? And so what did we do? We sat together and said, \u201cWell, who should be our manager?\u201d And we said, \u201cBrian Epstein.\u201d Who is that? The Beatles\u2019 manager. Brian E \u2014 how old are you? Brian Epstein said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll manage you, and I want to manage you.\u201d I know it\u2019s crazy. But it\u2019s true. And we said, \u201cWe want to go to Hamburg.\u201d \u201cTerrible idea,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go to Hamburg, you won\u2019t come back.\u201d And so then we thought, right. We need another manager. We just said, \u201cGood-bye. Bye-bye.\u201d The next day we\u2019re on the train going to Hamburg. Then when we got into the streets of the Star-Club and we saw it, it was all sex \u2014 sex, sex, sex bars. [GASPS] What is this? Oh, my god, this can\u2019t be true. [BELL TOLLS] And then Mary saw the church. I\u2019m all right. There\u2019s a church next door. [LAUGHS] The Liverbirds. [CHEERING] [MUSIC - THE LIVERBIRDS, \u2018PEANUT BUTTER\u2019] (SINGING) Peanut, peanut butter. Yeah, it tastes so good, but it\u2019s so hard to chew. Peanut \u2014 Peanut butter. That was the first time we did a television show. And it was massive. Yeah, I like peanut butter, and you like peanut butter. Oh, now, we like peanut butter, too. Let\u2019s go! [CHEERING] So we\u2019ve just got to go and rock now. Rock and roll. We did really massive tours all over Europe. Switzerland, Norway, Denmark \u2014 Vienna \u2013 Holland, Sweden. All over Germany. Crazy, crazy days. The people and the crowds were getting bigger. We were The Liverbirds. We were The Liverbirds. [MUSIC PLAYING] Fans used to meet us as we came off the plane, just screaming, yah! People running after us, autographs, presents. Royalty, you know. Pam started taking pills to give it a bit more energy. Oh, the pills. [LAUGHS] We played at the Star-Club with Jimi Hendrix. And Jimi Hendrix was sitting there, and he said, \u201cAre you the Liverbirds?\u201d We said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhich one\u2019s Mary?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been told that you make the best joints in Hamburg.\u201d Very religious one, and rolling joints for Jimi Hendrix. And did you try one? One time. Well, maybe twice. [LAUGHS] It\u2019s these youngsters from Liverpool. Ladies and gentlemen, The Beatles. [CHEERING] Just like The Beatles. There\u2019s always been an ambition to at least go to America. But go there and play would have been even better. Manfred Weissleder ruled the Star-Club. He said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s up to you.\u201d But \u2014 \u201cThey want you to play in Las Vegas, and you\u2019ll have to play topless.\u201d That was what he said. We said, \u201cTopless?\u201d Could you imagine me on the drums playing topless, shaking my head, and everything else, you know? So we said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going.\u201d We turned it down. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] That one that Pam wrote, \u2018Why Do You Hang Around Me,\u2019 that was very popular and famous. [MUSIC - THE LIVERBIRDS, \u2018WHY DO YOU HAND AROUND ME\u2019] (SINGING) If you\u2019ve found someone who loves you more and give you love you never had before \u2014 We stayed in Hamburg and became very well known all over Europe. We didn\u2019t even think what might have happened if we\u2019d had gone to America, or what might have happened if we\u2019d signed up with Brian Epstein. We just thought, we\u2019re enjoying it, and that\u2019s the main thing. Why do you hang around me? Of course we realized it wasn\u2019t going to go on forever. A little thing happened. That I got pregnant. Mama, daddy, mama, daddy, mama, daddy, mama, daddy. [LAUGHS] And I was having problems. I had lots of problems. I had to go see a doctor. And the doctor said, \u201cIf you carry on playing, you won\u2019t have this baby.\u201d And so that\u2019s when I had to leave. Valerie, we were playing in Munich, and there was this gorgeous boy dancing right in front of the stage. And Stephane \u2014 that was his name \u2014 he had a big rose in his hair. They got together. And he drove all the way from Munich to Hamburg. And just before he got to Hamburg, he had a car crash and was paralyzed for the rest of his life. So Val went to the hospital. And when he woke up, and he said he\u2019d come to ask her to get married to him \u2014 She married him. The offer came to tour Japan. But Sylvia had left, and Val couldn\u2019t come to Japan with us. So we rehearsed with these two German girls, went to Japan with them. They were good. But this feeling of belonging together, it wasn\u2019t the feeling anymore. So we decided, this is the time to stop. I had a wonderful life. I was probably one of the luckiest ones. One night at the Star-Club, somebody said, \u201cThere\u2019s a fella out there. He just looks like Bob Dylan.\u201d And that was Frank, my husband. Decided not to be a nun. Me? I married John, my John. I regret not going to Japan, because they had a wonderful time. And we could have gone on more and more and more if Val and I would have been there. It was a shame. But what if I would have lost my first son? I would have then blamed it on playing the drums. Sylvia and I, we had the best part of it. Stephane just kept getting worse and worse, and Valerie was taking care of him for 26 years. She went through a really hard time. So she started drinking very heavy. When he died, I said to Val, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to Hamburg? At least you\u2019ve got me here.\u201d So she did. She came to Hamburg and realized that she was more interested in women than in men. Got together and Mary said to me, \u201cThis is Val\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, hello.\u201d Happy again. And spent the last 10 years happily married until she died. Pam, she never got over the group splitting up. She became really addicted to cocaine and drink. And she got cancer of the lung. And I spent the last days in the hospital with her. I kept talking to her \u2014 oh, didn\u2019t we have good times together? And you wrote some beautiful songs. Such a talented person. Thank you. Thank you very much. From The Beatles, there\u2019s still \u2014 the drummer and the bass player still alive. And from The Liverbirds as well \u2014 Sylvia and I. Sylvia and I both lost our husbands two years ago, within 10 days of each other. And then this musical started just after they died that shows us when we first started out. Because we were one of the first all-girl rock and roll bands. So that brought us closer together. We telephone each other and we say, \u201cGosh, we really did do that.\u201d This thing we started together when we were 16 and finished when we were 22 and 23 \u2014 It was just meant. It was meant. It was meant for us girls to get together. It was meant for us to go to Hamburg. It was meant for us to meet our boyfriends. It was meant for us to have our children, our grandchildren. Meant to meet you. There must have been some sort of destiny behind it all. We were The Liverbirds. We were The Liverbirds. We never, ever got as famous as The Beatles. But we started as friends, and we ended as friends. [DISTANT CHEERING] That\u2019s John Lennon\u2019s house. [INAUDIBLE] That\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it? Yeah. Really nice, that. Really nice area. Accessible by the National Trust. Tickets available. And where\u2019s the placard? Oh, there, look. John Lennon lived here. And that was his room. Oh, that little \u2014 the little one at the side, or there\u2019s the \u2014 No, it\u2019s not on [INAUDIBLE] \u2014 this is [INAUDIBLE] Oh, right. These houses are lovely, aren\u2019t they? Really nice."]}
