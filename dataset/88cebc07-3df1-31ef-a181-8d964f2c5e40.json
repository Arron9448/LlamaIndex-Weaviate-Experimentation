It was bad enough when Blackjewel mining, one of the main employers in their eastern Kentucky community and the sixth-biggest mining company in America, went bust in July with their wages unpaid. But then word got out that the bankrupt company had sold\u2014and was about to shift\u2014almost 100 trucks of coal that the unrecompensed miners had dug up.", "Half a dozen of them took to the tracks and turned the train back. Another score, with wives and kids and neighbours in tow, helped them pitch a makeshift camp across the line. \u201cNo pay, we stay\u201d was their slogan\u2014daubed, in a militant-rustic style, on a bedsheet banner. A local restaurateur sent provisions, bluegrass musicians provided entertainment and journalists brought attention to the fight. Yet it was when the miners were joined by a group of transgender anarchists, acknowledged some of the handful still camping out on the track last week (amid vast piles of donated toiletries and food and a rising panic about bears), that they really got their camp organised.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "It is amazing how strange this impromptu protest has turned out to be\u2014and how revealing of America\u2019s culture wars. That is in part because of history. The miles-deep coal mines of Harlan County, a region of wooded Appalachian hills rising up to Kentucky\u2019s highest point, were for decades synonymous with violent industrial action. Clashes in the 1930s sparked by the miners\u2019 efforts to unionise gave the county its \u201cbloody\u201d moniker. Many of the Blackjewel miners\u2019 fathers and grandfathers were involved in them. \u201cMy dad told me about it, gun battles and company gun thugs that beat you to death,\u201d recalled Darrell Raleigh, seated beside the tracks. A veteran of 46 years underground, he himself took part in another round of strikes, in the 1970s, which left one dead and was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.", "Publicised on social media as #BloodyHarlan, the Blackjewel blockade looked like a time-honoured, morally unambiguous stand-off\u2014\u201cthe little man against the big man,\u201d as Mr Raleigh said with relish. The Harlan miners had been stiffed; their community had rallied around them splendidly; and Blackjewel\u2019s CEO , Jeff Hoops, looked like a classic fat-cat villain. While running his mining company into the ground, and never mind its 1,700 miners, he defaulted on corporate taxes while pouring millions into a vanity project\u2014an Appalachian resort called The Grand Patrician, named after his wife Patricia, that will boast a 3,500-seat replica of the Coliseum. For liberal observers, including journalists, activists and Bernie Sanders, whose campaign sent a batch of pizzas to express its support, the protest represented a rare opportunity to set aside the vexed and divisive realities of America\u2019s dying coal industry\u2014its pollution, its outsize political influence, its unanimous support for Donald Trump (for whom 85% of Bloody Harlanders voted)\u2014and reignite the class war.", "The arrival of the anarchists\u2014a roving band of hard-left protesters\u2014was emblematic of that effort. Led by a transgender activist called Lill, who refused to give a second name and preferred to be referred to by the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d, these efficient activists helped install a solar shower and camp kitchen, while dispensing legal advice to the miners. \u201cThey were just a big bundle of joy,\u201d sighed Stacy Rowe, who has been camping out with her miner-husband Chris throughout the protest. Yet politics impinged.", "Early this month the anarchists left in a huff after the miners refused to bar another visitor to the camp\u2014a member of a group of activist truckers\u2014on the basis that he wore a Trump T -shirt and espoused far-right views. Ms Rowe says she feels for them. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell someone how to believe politically. And we did end up eating Bernie Sanders\u2019s pizzas, which I didn\u2019t have a problem with.\u201d Yet since the anarchists\u2019 exit, coincidentally or not, the protest has petered out. Most of the miners drifted away; some to mines in other states, others to retrain as truckers, or in hope of being hired by the company seeking to reopen Blackjewel\u2019s five local mines. Mr Raleigh insists he will stay put \u201cuntil we get paid what\u2019s owed to us\u201d. But given the miners\u2019 poor chance of recovering the full sum, and that the Rowes\u2014mainstays of the camp\u2014are about to take off in a new truck, that seems unlikely. In a few days, the bears that Mr Raleigh and his wife are sleeping in their car for fear of will probably be free to consume the camp\u2019s leftover reserves of cookies and watermelons unmolested.", "For those on the left, such as Mr Sanders, who hope to win back the white working class with economic programmes and class-infused rhetoric, this is a cautionary saga. The industries and unions that made those politics possible are too diminished. Kentucky has as many lawyers as it has miners\u2014only about 6,000, few of whom are unionised. That helps explain why those in Harlan are still awaiting justice\u2014even after the state governor and other powerful politicians have spoken up for them during the stand-off. The social decay that has followed that institutional retreat is another reason why the politics of economic incentive now finds little purchase among them. The population of East Kentucky is one of the unhealthiest, most addicted, prematurely aged\u2014and otherwise unemployable\u2014in America.", "Not a class act", "Mr Trump\u2019s popularity among blue-collar whites, in Harlan and elsewhere, is not based on his promise to rebuild their shrunken industries. Having long since given up hope of that, they were turning to the Republican Party\u2019s quiet white identity politics long before he upped its volume. That is why hardly any miner in Harlan County appeared to blame a president who promised to \u201cbring back coal\u201d when most of their mines closed. Without wishing to make too much of a single incident, it was also why a row at the blockade between a trucker in a Trump T-shirt and an obliging transgender hippie was always likely to go the trucker\u2019s way.\u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/09/26/lessons-from-bloody-harlan", "title": "Lessons from Bloody Harlan", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["company", "mr", "county", "bloody", "protest", "politics", "mines", "miners", "lessons", "coal", "raleigh", "harlan"]}
