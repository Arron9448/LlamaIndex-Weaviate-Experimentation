Announced today during The Game Awards 2020, the game is arriving on May 10, 2021. Hood: Outlaws & Legends is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC that day. Pre-orders grant early access to the game starting on May 7, along with a cosmetic outfit kit. Sumo Digital and Focus Home Interactive are bringing some brutal team-based combat from the middle ages to life. Did you miss the original announcement for Hood: Outlaws & Legends? Check out the trailer below!", "Hood: Outlaws & Legends features two teams facing off in a battle to collect stolen riches, with four major character archetypes to pick from. Play as a ranger, a brawer, a mystic, or a hunter, with many customization options available to craft your own playstyle within the classes. Want a little backstory on the classes you can play at launch? Take a peek at the brawler trailer below, and find the entire class roster on the official YouTube.", "In what is essentially a medieval form of a major competitive heist, Hood: Outlaws & Legends pits players against deadly NPC guards protecting loot and each other in team-based battles for the goods. You won't just have to outplay the A.I., but the other team will be looking to steal your spoils as well! Strategic thinking and decision-making come into play as you determine what the most profitable and successful strategy will be when dealing with the A.I. opponents and your real-life adversaries. As you journey through battle after battle, you gain options to change your character's abilities, visuals, and weapon choices.", "The game is designed to push out content in a consistent fashion after launch, so new characters, maps, game modes, and events are all expected to arrive post-launch. With a mix of PvP and PvE concepts in the main game, it's easy to see how alternate game modes could focus more (or all!) on either experience.
