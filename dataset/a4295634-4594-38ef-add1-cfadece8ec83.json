It\u2019s great for pregnant\u2014\u2014\u201d here she pushes her belly out as far as it will go and starts laughing. \u201cAnd then look! Here\u2019s my party trick!\u201d She sucks her pregnant belly all the way in and smooths the dress out flat. \u201cAnd not pregnant!\u201d Then: \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Yes. \u201cOh, good. I have to eat. That\u2019s my new thing. Like, if there\u2019s no food? We don\u2019t need to stay.\u201d But wait. \u201cDo you want to see the pool really quick? The view is kinda maj.\u201d Up to the stairs we go, Graham exuberantly greeting everyone we pass: Hey, baby! Oh, hiii, sis! Standing by the pool, we take in the sweeping\u2014in point of fact, major\u2014view; it is the ultimate palimpsest, one that allows you to see all of the layers of New York history. In the summer, Graham tells me, she and her best friend hang out here on weekends. \u201cYou have to show up at 6 a.m. and wait in line to get a bed by the pool. So my best friend, who lives across the street, will come and wait in line for me. I show up at 7:30, and then all day we have our own bed. Instead of going to the Hamptons, which isn\u2019t our thing, we come here. Just walk across the street! This is our hood!\u201d", "But for a few months in a cramped apartment in Chelsea, Graham has been a Brooklyn girl since 2006. Indeed, she has lived at the same modest address in Park Slope since she was 17, when she signed with Wilhelmina and began modeling in earnest. Rachel, the aforementioned best friend, was the real estate agent who found her the apartment. \u201cShe\u2019s been my ride or die for 16 years,\u201d says Graham, who\u2019s now pointing out a building off in the distance where she and her husband of nine years, cinematographer and documentarian Justin Ervin, finally bought themselves a serious home: a whopping three-story loft\u2014a dope triplex, as she might say in one of the many voices from her repertoire\u2014that has been under renovation for many, many months. One day soon, the best view in New York City will be hers. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting away my money,\u201d she says of renting for all those years. \u201cI mean, I wasted money or other things like clothes and . . . caviar.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut this apartment is a really big deal for me.\u201d", "We head back downstairs, find a table, and order breakfast. I notice her nails, shellacked to a fare-thee-well. \u201cHomegrown, baby!\u201d She holds them up for inspection. \u201cI think this color is called High Maintenance.\u201d Her left ear is like a wind chime, dangling with so many earrings you can hear them clinking together. \u201cSeventeen holes,\u201d she says. Suddenly her big black bag starts to vibrate, not with the zzzzt . . . zzzzt . . . zzzzt of a cell phone but the continuous low-frequency hum of, say, a vibrator. \u201cCall me out, Jonathan!\u201d she says, laughing as she digs in and finds the culprit: a handheld fan. Really, I say. \u201cOh! When you\u2019re pregnant? And it\u2019s hot? You need one of these walking around the city.\u201d And then she pulls a smaller bag out of her big bag. \u201cI carried this last night to the Fenty show\u2014little vintage Chanel moment. I\u2019m giving it back to my stylist tomorrow. Don\u2019t own it!\u201d"], "summary": "Graham is five months pregnant when we meet, and wearing a black chiffon dress from The Row that skims the floor.\n\u201cDo you want to see the pool really quick?\nThe view is kinda maj.\u201d Up to the stairs we go, Graham exuberantly greeting everyone we pass: Hey, baby!\nIn the summer, Graham tells me, she and her best friend hang out here on weekends.\nThis is our hood!\u201dBut for a few months in a cramped apartment in Chelsea, Graham has been a Brooklyn girl since 2006.", "id": "a4295634-4594-38ef-add1-cfadece8ec83", "title": "Plus One!
