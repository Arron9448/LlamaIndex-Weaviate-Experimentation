The 2030 reduction target had previously been set at 40%.", "It has also been agreed that the EU will invest further in \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d such as forests, grasslands and wetlands. MEPs involved in the talks claimed this would in effect equate to a 57% net reduction target for member states.", "However, environmental groups were quick out of the blocks in criticising the deal. The agreement fails to tie up all member states to zero emissions by 2050 as a consequence of Poland opting out of a provisional leaders\u2019 agreement on the target last December. Poland relies on coal for 80% of the country\u2019s electricity.", "MEPs, who had sought a 60% cut by 2030, also failed to significantly raise the ambitions of the EU\u2019s capitals despite the claims on Wednesday that the bloc was showing global leadership on the climate emergency.", "Earlier this week, the UK government said it would toughen its targets on greenhouse gas emissions for the next 15 years, the first major developed economy to do so. Following recommendations of the government\u2019s statutory climate advisers, carbon dioxide is to be cut in the UK by 78% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels", "Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, an alliance of environmental NGOs, said: \u201cThe \u2018at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030\u2019 is not in line with the Paris agreement\u2019s ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century.\u201d", "Trio said the target had been \u201crushed by EU lawmakers to bring something to the leaders\u2019 summit organised by the US\u201d. \u201cThis is definitely not the kind of climate law that will help the EU to lead the global efforts to tackle climate change,\u201d he said.", "Biden, whose first act as president was to reinstate the US to the Paris climate agreement, will chair a virtual summit of 40 world leaders on Thursday. It is being seen as a key milestone on the road to the UN climate Change conference (Cop26) this November in Glasgow where leaders will underscore the need to limit planetary warming to 1.5C by the end of the century.", "Barbara Mariani, senior policy officer for climate and energy with the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), said the target translated to only a 52.8% cut in actual emissions from polluting sectors as the larger figure took into account emissions that could potentially be absorbed. Under current measures the EU already expects to reduce emissions by 46% of 2030.", "\u201cToday\u2019s agreement is not a victory for climate action, it\u2019s a farce,\u201d Mariani said. \u201cWe are also baffled to see that the council [of member states] rejected a proposal to extend the EU\u2019s climate neutrality target to all member states, which risks triggering lack of accountability at national level and creating a two-speed Europe in which some countries will inevitably lag behind.\u201d", "Pascal Canfin, the Renew Europe MEP, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee, said it had proved \u201cimpossible\u201d to move the 27 member states from the headline target of a reduction of 55% following agreement at a summit last December, but that commitments on investment in carbon sinks were a significant win.", "\u201cThere was definitely no space to change the wording \u2018at least 55 net,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried, I don\u2019t know how many times, but it was not possible \u2026 parliament was obviously ready to go even further, but the compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.\u201d The deal will now be fine-tuned by lawyers ahead of formal adoption by the institutions."], "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "keywords": ["agreement", "emissions", "reduction", "55", "member", "target", "states", "climate", "disappoints", "carbon", "experts", "cut", "eu", "2030"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
