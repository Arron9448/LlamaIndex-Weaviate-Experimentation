He was effectively dismissed later that month. \u201cThis is a debacle,\u201d Hart emailed Cooper. \u201cIs Brewer a moron or a Manchurian candidate?\u201d", "In August, attorneys from James\u2019s office met with North at the Washington offices of Williams & Connolly, home to Brendan Sullivan, who was by North\u2019s side during the Iran-contra hearings more than three decades earlier. This time, James was seeking documents concerning \u201cfinancial impropriety, mismanagement, misuse or waste of assets, governance failures or other wrongdoing,\u201d according to her office\u2019s subpoena to North. James had come to see him as a key cooperating witness, a once-unthinkable development.", "By then, months of leaks had provided plenty of fodder for investigators. James, a Brooklynite who worked her way through Howard University\u2019s law school and served as New York City\u2019s public advocate, has been on the N.R.A.\u2019s radar since she emerged as front-runner last year and declared that the N.R.A. was a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d When I asked Brewer about the claim, he said it was like \u201ca third-world dictatorship.\u201d", "\u201cIt seemed unprofessional and inappropriate for someone who is a candidate for that type of high office to prejudge any private citizen with no facts, no evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou target your enemies and then you figure out a way to use the power that you have to destroy them. That\u2019s not right.\u201d James\u2019s office, in a statement, responded: \u201cWe won\u2019t be intimidated by the N.R.A.\u2019s bully tactics, whether in the press or in the courtroom.\u201d", "Earlier this month, James\u2019s office sent the N.R.A. a new subpoena, seeking records related to political donations, tax compliance, payments to board members and to the N.R.A. Foundation, an affiliated charity that diverted $36 million to the N.R.A. last year. The foundation\u2019s move raised red flags among tax experts I spoke with, since donations to it are tax deductible, while donations to the N.R.A., which is not a charity, are not deductible. The foundation is also being investigated by Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, where it is chartered.", "I asked LaPierre if he worried about his own criminal exposure. \u201cI actually don\u2019t,\u201d he said, citing the safe-harbor provision. He called Brewer\u2019s work \u201cthe largest forensic audit that\u2019s ever been done on the association\u201d to \u201csee if there was anything we needed to self-correct.\u201d Tax experts I spoke with, however, noted that such provisions did not generally apply to personal expenses, and in any case would need to have been addressed before James opened the inquiry. The investigation is being led by the charities bureau of the attorney general\u2019s office, which oversees all nonprofits. Such investigations are typically civil procedures, but the office can refer criminal findings to another agency, or be granted criminal jurisdiction by the governor.", "\u201cIf the expenses incurred by Mr. LaPierre were not legitimate business expenses of the N.R.A., and if he conspired with others within or outside the N.R.A. to incur those expenses in a way that would conceal them, then criminal charges could not only be brought against Mr. LaPierre, but also the others who were involved in the scheme,\u201d said Sean Delany, a former chief of the charities bureau. Daniel Kurtz, another former charities-bureau chief, said the N.R.A. would have to establish that such transactions were \u201cfair, reasonable and in the corporation\u2019s best interest,\u201d adding, \u201cThey can assert that, but it\u2019s preposterous.\u201d Kurtz did see some hurdles for a criminal case, based on what was known, because LaPierre was not said to have diverted money directly into his own pocket. But the attorney general can go to court and seek to restructure an organization\u2019s board, oust its management, recoup misspent funds or even pressure it to dissolve.", "\u201cEverybody knows we were singled out,\u201d LaPierre said. \u201cEverybody knows that it\u2019s politics.\u201d Whatever the fate of the N.R.A., he has held on far longer than many thought he could. In his spartan office, he seemed weary. After many long years spent building one of the most powerful organizations in Washington, he had found himself isolated and embattled. \u201cSomebody asked me in a deposition how you feel about all of it,\u201d he recalled, briefly looking up once more. \u201cI said I feel sad.\u201d"]}
