He and his comrades were told that many of the detainees were responsible for 9/11 and, given the opportunity, would strike again. \u201cI just remember being super excited, because I thought, I\u2019m going to be doing something important,\u201d Wood told me. For two weeks, he worked as a guard in the cellblocks, monitoring men who had been captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan. Then a sergeant major pulled him aside for a brief interview, and assigned him to work the night shift in Echo Special, a secret, single-occupancy unit that had been built to house the United States military\u2019s highest-value detainee. The International Committee of the Red Cross\u2014which has access to many of the world\u2019s most notorious detention sites, some of them in countries where there is no rule of law\u2014had recently sent representatives to Guant\u00e1namo, but the base commander, citing \u201cmilitary necessity,\u201d had refused to allow them into Echo Special. The man confined there was referred to by his detainee number, 760. When Wood tried to search for 760 in Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s detainee database, he found nothing. Wood was the second of three boys. His father died in a plane crash when he was three years old, and his mother brought him and his brothers up in Molalla, Oregon, a lumber town about an hour south of Portland. His mother dated a string of alcoholics and addicts, and took the children to an evangelical church on Sundays; Pat Robertson\u2019s sermons blasted from the living-room TV. In 1999, shortly after graduating from high school, Wood started a job at the local sawmill. Several of his co-workers were missing fingers, and the manager took every opportunity to denigrate the staff. After a few months, he signed up for the Oregon National Guard, on the military-police track. He sought structure and discipline\u2014a life of pride, purpose, and clarity of mission. After 9/11, patriotism eclipsed restlessness as Wood\u2019s primary motivation to serve. He had spent the morning of the worst terrorist attack in American history lying on his mother\u2019s couch, high on painkillers after a tonsillectomy, but when he emerged from the haze he was angry, focussed, and longing for deployment. He didn\u2019t harbor any particular animosity toward Muslims, but he had absorbed his mother\u2019s belief: \u201cIf it\u2019s not from Jesus then it must be from the Devil.\u201d After completing the requirements to become an M.P., Wood enrolled in a criminal-justice program at a nearby community college. He recalled his political views as being \u201cwhatever Fox News told us.\u201d He didn\u2019t know the difference between a Hindu, a Sikh, and a Muslim\u2014he had never met one. Before his first shift in Echo Special, Wood was told to place a strip of electrical tape over the name on his uniform, and to use only nicknames inside the cell, so that if 760 were to somehow sneak a message out of the camp he couldn\u2019t issue fatwas against his guards or their families. \u201cNever turn your back,\u201d the sergeant major warned him. Wood, who was twenty-three, had recently learned that his girlfriend was pregnant. He wouldn\u2019t take any chances. \u201cYou trust the handcuffs and everything, but, no matter what, we\u2019d never be with him one on one\u2014there would always be a partner,\u201d Wood told me. Until recently, the guards and the interrogators had worn Halloween masks inside the cell. Wood walked through the camp to Echo Special proud to be part of a serious national-security operation. He thought, It must be somebody really important\u2014the most dangerous person in the world, perhaps\u2014to have this special attention, a guard force just for him. Echo Special was a trailer that had been divided in two. Wood walked into the main area, which housed the guards; through a door was the prisoner\u2019s sleeping space. A government report describes the facility as having been \u201cmodified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,\u201d with doors that had been \u201csealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.\u201d Inside, the walls were \u201ccovered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.\u201d There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound. An M.P. explained to Wood that the current guard force called Detainee 760 \u201cPillow,\u201d because when they had arrived, several months earlier, a pillow was the only object in his possession. Then one of them shouted, \u201cPillow, you can come out now!\u201d A short man in his mid-thirties stepped into the guards\u2019 area, unshackled. He wore a broad smile and a white jumpsuit, and moved cautiously toward Wood. The detainee introduced himself as Mohamedou Salahi, then reached for a handshake, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude?\u201d Wood is six feet three, with a shaved head, a shy, stoic manner, and the musculature of an \u00e9lite bodybuilder. Although he towered over Salahi, he hesitated before taking his hand, and when he did he noted how delicate Salahi was. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Wood said. But he thought, What the fuck is this? This is the exact opposite of what\u2019s supposed to happen.", "The fragmented image of Mohamedou Salahi that United States military, law-enforcement, and intelligence agencies assembled in a classified dossier was that of a \u201chighly intelligent\u201d Mauritanian electrical engineer, who, \u201cas a key al-Qaida member,\u201d had played a role in several mass-casualty plots. Other men carried box cutters and explosives; Salahi was a ghost on the periphery. The evidence against him lacked depth, but investigators considered its breadth conclusive. His proximity to so many events and high-level jihadi figures could not be explained by coincidence, they thought, and only a logistical mastermind could have left so faint a trail. The U.S. government gathered that in 1991, when Salahi was twenty, he swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, and the following year he learned to handle weapons at an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. Later, Salahi moved to Germany, where, the Americans assessed, \u201chis primary responsibility was to recruit for al-Qaida in Europe.\u201d Among his alleged recruits were three of the 9/11 hijackers, all of whom served as pilots on separate planes. A fourth was Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the attack co\u00f6rdinator; while in C.I.A. custody, bin al-Shibh named Salahi as the man who had arranged his travel to Afghanistan and his introduction to bin Laden. In 1998, shortly after Al Qaeda detonated truck bombs outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Salahi took a call from a phone number belonging to bin Laden. Then, and on at least one other occasion, a member of Al Qaeda\u2019s Shura Council\u2014its leadership\u2014wired some four thousand dollars to Salahi\u2019s bank account in Germany; Salahi withdrew the cash and handed it to men who were travelling to West Africa, to facilitate what the Americans assessed to be money-laundering and telecommunications \u201cprojects for al-Qaida.\u201d In 1999, the Shura member called Salahi, but U.S. intelligence didn\u2019t know what his instructions were. In November of that year, Salahi moved to Montreal, where he began leading prayers at a prominent mosque. Soon afterward, a jihadi who had attended the same mosque\u2014and who the Americans believed had met Salahi\u2014attempted to smuggle explosives in the trunk of a car across the U.S. border; his plan was to detonate suitcases inside Los Angeles International Airport, in what became known as the Millennium Plot. Canada\u2019s Security Intelligence Service began a surveillance operation focussing on Salahi and his associates, but Salahi noticed two pinhole cameras poking through his apartment walls and left the country. The U.S. government concluded that he was \u201cthe leader of the Montreal-based al-Qaida cell.\u201d In Guant\u00e1namo, Salahi admitted to this and other allegations. \u201cI came to Canada with a plan to blow up the CN Tower in Toronto,\u201d Salahi wrote, in one of his many confessions. He listed his accomplices and added, \u201cthanks to Canadian Intel, the plan was discovered and sentenced to failure.\u201d After years of holding out in interrogations, he had become what the classified dossier described as a \u201chighly cooperative\u201d font of intelligence\u2014\u201cone of the most valuable sources in detention.\u201d He described Al Qaeda\u2019s financial involvement in credit-card fraud and drug smuggling, and also the group\u2019s \u201cinvestment in unwitting companies in Bosnia, Canada, Chechnya, Denmark, England, Germany, Mauritania, and Spain.\u201d He drew organizational charts, with the names and operational roles of key figures, and supplied intelligence on jihadi cells and safe houses all over Europe and West Africa. Owing to his expertise as an electrical engineer, the dossier concludes, Salahi was also able to describe Al Qaeda\u2019s elaborate communications systems, \u201cincluding radio relay, couriers, encryption, phone boutiques, and satellite communication links to laptops.\u201d But the U.S. government was sure there was more to be gleaned from him; the dossier says that he \u201cstill has useful information\u201d on a variety of subjects, including the 9/11 attacks, and lists twenty-two additional \u201careas of potential exploitation.\u201d Military officials considered him \u201cthe poster child for the intelligence effort at Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d", "As a result of Salahi\u2019s co\u00f6peration, his private cell was now stocked with what the government referred to as \u201ccomfort items.\u201d After the pillow came soap, towels, a prayer cap, and prayer beads\u2014by the time Steve Wood arrived, Salahi also had books, a television, a PlayStation, and an old laptop, on which he killed time playing chess and watching DVDs. Eventually, Salahi would be allowed access to a small patch of soil outside his trailer, where he tended sunflowers, basil, sage, parsley, and cilantro. \u201cWhat I was told was that his information had saved thousands of American lives,\u201d Wood said, \u201cand this is what they\u2019d given him to keep talking.\u201d Salahi was taken into custody when he was thirty years old, but he had already lived on four continents, and spoke fluent Arabic, French, and German. English was his fourth language. Since he had learned it in captivity, some of his earliest phrases were \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing,\u201d \u201ccavity search,\u201d \u201cfuck this,\u201d and \u201cfuck that.\u201d \u201cMy problem is that I had been picking the language from the \u2018wrong\u2019 people\u2014namely, U.S. Forces recruits who speak grammatically incorrectly,\u201d he wrote on a scrap of paper inside his cell. \u201cEnglish accepts more curses than any other language, and I soon learned to curse with the commoners.\u201d As a matter of professionalism, Wood resolved from the outset to bury in the back of his mind what he had heard of Salahi\u2019s past. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sit there and laugh and chat with the guy, if he\u2019s actually that bad,\u201d Wood told me. The night shift was twelve hours, and he never saw Salahi shackled or restrained. Other Guant\u00e1namo prisoners threw punches and feces and urine, but, according to the classified dossier, Salahi\u2019s only disciplinary infraction was that, on May 11, 2003, he \u201cpossessed an excessive amount of MRE food.\u201d Salahi often appeared sullen and withdrawn. But, when he wanted to engage, he spoke with a worldly, provocative humor that Wood found appealing. He liked to rile his guards into debating equality, race, and religion, and he wielded a sophisticated understanding of history and geopolitics to chip away at their beliefs. Before meeting Salahi, Wood had never heard of Mauritania; Salahi told him that, to his great embarrassment, slavery was still practiced there, even among people close to him. Salahi also pushed him to research Western foreign-policy blunders\u2014for example, that in 1953 the American and the British intelligence services had orchestrated a coup in Iran, overthrowing a popular Prime Minister in order to prop up a tyrannical, pro-Western Shah. \u201cHave you heard of Nelson Mandela?\u201d Wood recalled Salahi saying. \u201cLook him up, dude. Look up the prison on Robben Island. See if you think his captivity was just. See what it did to his family.\u201d A job posting depicts life as an intelligence officer in Guant\u00e1namo Bay as \u201ca rewarding challenge with incredible surroundings\u201d\u2014sunsets, beaches, iguanas, pristine Caribbean blue. \u201cAfter a hustled day of tackling a myriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war on terrorism,\u201d it reads, \u201cfun awaits.\u201d Officers could partake in pottery classes, paintball, rugby, tennis, and softball, or exercise in several pools and gyms. The local dive shop offered gear and certifications for sailing, water-skiing, snorkelling, scuba diving, and more: \u201cNo experience, no problem. . . . Relaxing is easy.\u201d In practice, many military-police officers killed time by watching movies and getting drunk at the Tiki Bar; they also took flights to Afghanistan, to pick up more detainees. But Wood spent his days in the base library, researching topics that Salahi had brought up in the cell. He devoured volumes on history, foreign affairs, politics, civil rights\u2014\u201cpretty much any type of book you could think of, other than, like, romance novels,\u201d he said. \u201cI was educating myself on the world.\u201d But, because Salahi\u2019s trailer was a national secret, Wood kept a cordial distance from most of the other guards. \u201cI\u2019d come home and iron my uniform, and my roommates didn\u2019t know a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d ask me, \u2018Who\u2019s in there?,\u2019 and I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t know, probably somebody famous.\u2019 \u201d In time, Wood began to think of everything he had known before meeting Salahi as a narrow-minded myth of American superiority, notable for its omissions of overseas misadventures. Meanwhile, the Bush Administration\u2019s pretext for invading Iraq was collapsing, and so was Wood\u2019s trust in government. It was the spring of 2004. There were no weapons of mass destruction. The \u201cmission\u201d had not been \u201caccomplished.\u201d When Wood watched the evening news, he saw photographs of American M.P.s torturing and sexually humiliating Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. He began to wonder whether the case against Mohamedou Salahi was as flimsy and politically motivated as that for the invasion had been. \u201cI was, like, What else have they lied about?\u201d he said. Salahi underwent daily interrogations. The sessions Wood witnessed were calm and courteous, with Salahi attempting to answer everything asked of him. \u201cIt was the pretty blond interrogator bringing in these disks with footage from Al Qaeda and Taliban training camps in Afghanistan,\u201d Wood recalled. The videos had been pulled from jihadi Web sites, or captured by intelligence officers during raids, and Salahi\u2019s role was to identify the people in them. But sometimes, after co\u00f6perating, \u201che\u2019d get depressed and anxious, and say, \u2018I\u2019m a bad Muslim,\u2019 \u201d Wood told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say, \u2018No matter what you did in the past, man, you\u2019ve saved thousands of lives.\u2019 I\u2019d always say that, and he\u2019d just shake his head, like, \u2018Bullshit.\u2019 \u201d One night, when Salahi was asleep, Wood heard sounds that reminded him of a child having a nightmare. He walked into the sleeping area and found Salahi lying in the fetal position, shaking. No adult in Wood\u2019s life had ever looked so frightened and so vulnerable. He gently held Salahi\u2019s shoulder, and said, \u201cEverything\u2019s O.K.\u201d Salahi shook his head, and clicked his tongue in disagreement, but refused to speak. The next day, Wood pressed him to talk about the episode, but Salahi wouldn\u2019t elaborate. He just said, \u201cDude, they fucked me up.\u201d The night terrors kept coming. Salahi was on a diet of Ensure nutrition shakes and antidepressants. One day, he complained to Wood that the interrogators were demanding information on events that he couldn\u2019t possibly know about, because they had taken place while he was in custody. Although Wood had introduced himself to Salahi as Stretch, his nickname from the sawmill, Salahi had quickly learned his real name, as well as those of the other guards. \u201cThe tape would fall off our uniforms,\u201d Wood recalled. \u201cWe\u2019d try to cover it back up, real quick, but eventually we were, like, fuck it. We knew he wasn\u2019t a threat.\u201d Where once he had struggled to forgive himself for enjoying Salahi\u2019s company, he now felt bad about having to lock the door at the end of each shift. He walked into the morning sunlight in a daze, unable to reconcile his impression of the man in Echo Special with the depiction of the terrorist in the dossier. Had Wood remained as a regular guard, in one of the regular cellblocks, he might have finished his deployment with his understanding of the global war on terror more or less intact. Instead, he began to wonder whether what he was actually protecting at Guant\u00e1namo was one of the government\u2019s darkest secrets: that its highest-value military detainee was being held essentially by mistake, and that his isolation in Echo Special was intended to cover up the hell that had been inflicted upon him. One day, Salahi started requesting paper from his guards. As the result of a recent court ruling, Guant\u00e1namo detainees had access to legal representation, and so, during the next several months, Salahi drafted a diary of his detention as a series of harrowing letters to his lawyers, Nancy Hollander, Sylvia Royce, and Theresa Duncan\u2014four hundred and sixty-six pages, sealed in envelopes and mailed to a classified facility near Washington, D.C. No guards or interrogators were allowed to read Salahi\u2019s work. For the first time, he described his experiences without fear of retribution. On one page, he recalled the day he got his nickname, when an interrogator brought him a pillow. \u201cI received the present with a fake overwhelming happiness, and not because I was dying to get a pillow,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo. I took the pillow as a sign of the end of the physical torture.\u201d The Detainee", "Mohamedou Ould Salahi was born in late December, 1970, the ninth child of a Mauritanian camel herder and his wife. Like most countries in West Africa, Mauritania had gained independence from France a decade earlier. Few locals spoke French, but since the country had been arbitrarily drawn up as a vast, mostly desert territory, populated by numerous ethnic groups who spoke different languages, there was no alternative for official documentation. When a nurse, who spoke only Hassaniya Arabic, filled out Mohamedou\u2019s birth certificate in the Latin alphabet, she omitted a syllable from his last name. Salahi became \u201cSlahi.\u201d So began a life in which governments treated Salahi in accordance with their own mistakes. Salahi was a precocious student; after school, he used to steal chalk from the classroom and return to Bouhdida, a dusty, unplanned neighborhood in Mauritania\u2019s capital, Nouakchott, to re-create the day\u2019s lessons for kids who couldn\u2019t afford an education. Mauritania is an Islamic republic, with rich traditions in poetry and recitation that belie its dismal rates of literacy and economic growth. As a teen-ager, Salahi memorized the entire Quran. Abu Hafs, Salahi\u2019s cousin and a senior Al Qaeda official, evaded capture. Photograph courtesy Ben Taub He grew up measuring political eras by military coups\u20141978, 1979, 1984\u2014changes in power that did little to alter the ways in which Mauritanians experienced power. The lack of progress, development, and freedom in Mauritanian society inspired in Salahi a righteous anger toward autocracy and corruption, and a desire to fight for something bigger than himself. In the eighties, he and a younger cousin, a slender poet named Mahfouz Ould al-Walid, spent their evenings at a local caf\u00e9, where the owner showed videos of the Palestinian struggle and the jihad in Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union had invaded in 1979. In 1988, the Saudi ideologue Osama bin Laden announced the formation of Al Qaeda. Walid, who was thirteen, started reading bin Laden\u2019s pamphlets. He and Salahi were smitten with the Al Qaeda narrative, that a ragtag group of mujahideen, carrying light weapons and hiding in caves, were taking on a superpower in the defense of all Muslims. They weren\u2019t the only people taken by this struggle\u2014the C.I.A. was funding and equipping many of the mujahideen groups. In 1988, Salahi graduated from high school and won a scholarship to study engineering in Duisburg, Germany. He was the first person in his family to attend university. But the call to jihad interrupted his studies. By 1990, the Soviets had withdrawn from Afghanistan, but Al Qaeda was still fighting against the Communist Afghan government that the Soviets had installed. That December, shortly before his twentieth birthday, Salahi boarded a flight to Pakistan and crossed into Afghanistan, and although he never met bin Laden, he soon pledged his allegiance to the Al Qaeda leadership. Walid, who was sixteen, stayed behind. But two months later, when Salahi returned to Mauritania and described his experience of the jihad, Walid resolved to set off on his own for Afghanistan. Walid was a prodigious poet\u2014in Nouakchott, he had won several awards\u2014and when bin Laden met him he was impressed by his eloquence and conviction. Soon afterward, they travelled together to Sudan, where bin Laden ran a construction company and a jihadi training camp, and sped around Khartoum in bin Laden\u2019s white Mercedes. In the spring of 1992, Salahi returned to Afghanistan. Because he had no experience with weapons, Al Qaeda personnel sent him to the Al Farouq training camp, near Khost, where he learned how to use a Kalashnikov rifle and launch rocket-propelled grenades. But by then the Soviet Union had collapsed, and, while Salahi was in training, the Afghan government lost its Russian support. Afghanistan\u2019s civil war entered a new stage, with rival Islamist groups vying for control, and Salahi wanted no part of it. After three months, he left Afghanistan and returned to Duisburg, where he worked in a computer-repair shop while he finished his degree. Another two years passed before Salahi\u2019s name caught the attention of Deddahi Ould Abdellahi, the head of Mauritania\u2019s security-intelligence apparatus. In 1994, as the director of state security, he opened an investigation into Nouakchott\u2019s jihadi scene. Several Mauritanians had travelled to battlefields in Afghanistan and Bosnia, and Mahfouz Walid had become an important figure in Al Qaeda; he now went by the nom de guerre Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. In Nouakchott, Abdellahi and his subordinates began to map out the network, detaining people close to Abu Hafs and soliciting the names of other jihadis. Several young men mentioned Salahi as a contact in Germany. With the assistance of German intelligence, Abdellahi told me, \u201cwe started collecting the maximum amount of information. How does he live? How does he behave? How does he react to world events?\u201d It was unclear to Abdellahi whether Salahi was still active within Al Qaeda, but he seemed to be someone whom all the Mauritanian Islamists knew.", "Abu Hafs ascended to Al Qaeda\u2019s Shura Council, where he served as bin Laden\u2019s personal adviser on Sharia law. In 1996, when Abu Hafs was twenty-one, he drafted bin Laden\u2019s most important fatwa: an eleven-thousand-word document excoriating the Saudi Kingdom and warning the U.S. Secretary of Defense that Al Qaeda\u2019s adherents \u201chave no intention except to enter paradise by killing you.\u201d The fatwa was Al Qaeda\u2019s declaration of war against the United States. According to \u201cThe Exile,\u201d a comprehensive account of post-9/11 Al Qaeda, by the investigative journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy, who gained access to Abu Hafs\u2019s diaries, he ghostwrote \u201cmost of Osama\u2019s speeches, religious judgments, and press releases.\u201d In 1998, bin Laden wrote Abu Hafs into his will. Around that time, after a long period without contact, Abu Hafs called Salahi from bin Laden\u2019s satellite phone. The cousins had married a pair of sisters, and so they were now also brothers-in-law. But, after Salahi returned to Germany, they had scarcely been in touch. While Abu Hafs was handling Al Qaeda\u2019s affairs in East Africa, his father became ill, and so, as both men remember it, Abu Hafs requested Salahi\u2019s help in transferring money to care for his family in Mauritania. Salahi agreed, and Abu Hafs wired around four thousand dollars to his German account. Salahi withdrew the cash and gave it to friends who were travelling to Nouakchott, and they delivered it to Abu Hafs\u2019s family. A similar phone call, followed by a second transaction, took place in December, 1998. But, after Abu Hafs used bin Laden\u2019s phone to call a different cousin in Nouakchott, Abdellahi\u2019s subordinates took the cousin into custody, and tortured him for two months. So, when Abu Hafs called Salahi for assistance a third time, in early 1999, Salahi refused, and hung up. Al Qaeda had by this time transformed into an international terrorist organization that was launching attacks in East Africa and the Middle East. The U.S. had fired cruise missiles at Al Qaeda-linked targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, and, in a bid to capture Abu Hafs, the C.I.A. had raided a hotel in Khartoum. (He escaped through a kitchen door.) One night in October, 1999, a friend of Salahi\u2019s asked him to host three Muslims who were passing through Duisburg. Over dinner, they explained that they were heading east, for the jihad. The men slept on his floor and left for Afghanistan at dawn. Salahi didn\u2019t know their real names, and never heard from them again. By now, Salahi was under surveillance by German intelligence. But the Germans saw no reason to detain or question him. According to an investigation by Der Spiegel, \u201che preached in gloomy back-yard mosques,\u201d and remained in occasional contact with jihadis\u2014men whose names and cell-phone numbers would turn up in investigations spanning Africa, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. But he did not consider himself a member of Al Qaeda, or a facilitator of its operations. One day, German officers questioned one of Salahi\u2019s friends. When they asked whether Salahi was involved in any terrorist activities, the friend laughed. But Salahi wanted to live free of surveillance, and he decided to leave the country. One of Salahi\u2019s friends, who was now living in Canada, suggested that he move to Montreal. \u201cHe said, \u2018Canada is amazing\u2014there is no racism, they speak French, and it is just a very advanced country,\u2019 \u201d Salahi said years later, in a U.S. military hearing. \u201cYou will have a job at the snap of a finger,\u201d his friend told him. Ramadan was approaching\u2014when the men leading prayers read aloud the entire Quran during the course of a lunar cycle\u2014and, Salahi recalled, \u201cmy friend said, \u2018We need you here in Canada because we have no Hafez,\u2019 \u201d the Arabic word for a man who can recite the Quran from memory. \u201cIn Arabic countries there are oodles, but in Europe and Canada one is very rare.\u201d Salahi landed in Montreal on November 26, 1999. (His wife returned to Nouakchott.) His friend, Hosni Mohsen, introduced him to the imam at the Al Sunnah mosque. The mosque had thousands of attendees, a few of whom belonged to an Algerian jihadi group that had come to the attention of the French and Canadian intelligence services. \u201cBad people always want to blend into a crowd,\u201d Salahi explained at the military hearing. Some of Mohsen\u2019s \u201cbad friends,\u201d as Salahi described them, visited Mohsen\u2019s apartment while he was hosting Salahi. \u201cSo look at me,\u201d Salahi said. \u201cI have contact with Osama bin Laden\u2019s operative, who was helping launder money. I\u2019m now in Canada, attending a mosque where we believe a very dangerous group is attending.\u201d And, because it was Ramadan, Salahi was leading prayers. \u201cSomething is going on.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not looking good,\u201d the presiding military officer replied. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not looking good at all,\u201d Salahi said. \u201cIt will look worse.\u201d", "One of the Algerian jihadis was Ahmed Ressam, a serial thief who was living in Canada under a false identity. In 1998, he had travelled to Afghanistan, and spent a year in Al Qaeda training camps, where he learned to handle weapons and explosives. In the spring of 1999, French intelligence officers asked their Canadian counterparts if they could question Ressam about jihadi activities in Europe, but the Canadians couldn\u2019t locate him, because he had entered the country on a fake passport. A week after Salahi began leading prayers at the Al Sunnah mosque, Ressam drove a rental car onto a U.S.-bound ferry in Victoria, British Columbia. When the boat reached Port Angeles, near Seattle, customs officers found in the car more than a hundred pounds of explosives, along with four timed detonators, each fashioned from a nine-volt battery, a circuit board, and a Casio watch. Ressam told investigators that he had planned to detonate suitcases in a crowded terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. \u201cI hope you treasure every minute of strangers telling you to treasure every minute.\u201d After the failed attack, Canada began to aggressively investigate the Montreal cell. \u201cThey were very jumpy,\u201d Salahi recalled at his hearing. \u201cThey were everywhere in the mosque, in the police car, twenty-four hours.\u201d Among the targets of the investigation was Mohsen, Salahi\u2019s friend and host. Upon Mohsen\u2019s arrest, according to a court filing, investigators found \u201cpocket litter\u201d that included \u201cboth Salahi\u2019s name and Ressam\u2019s phone number.\u201d (Mohsen could not be reached for comment.) One night, Salahi awoke to the sound of a tiny hole being drilled into his wall. The next morning, he found two pinhole cameras. Salahi called the police to report that his neighbors were spying on him, but they told him that he should just cover the cameras with glue. Soon afterward, Canadian investigators came to the apartment and questioned him about the Millennium Plot. \u201cI was scared to hell,\u201d Salahi recalled at his hearing. \u201cThey asked me do I know Ahmed Ressam. I said, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d (Investigators later determined that Ressam had left Montreal for a safe house in Vancouver on November 17th\u2014nine days before Salahi arrived in Canada.) He began to notice surveillance everywhere. \u201cO.K., screw it, it is not a problem\u2014they can watch me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were afraid that I would kill some people.\u201d In Mauritania, Abdellahi\u2019s men detained Salahi\u2019s wife and brothers and interrogated them about the Millennium Plot. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me, because they were scared,\u201d Salahi recalled. But his family members were eager for Salahi to return, and so they told him that his mother was ill. On January 21, 2000, Salahi boarded a flight to Senegal. It was cheaper to fly to Dakar than to Nouakchott, and his brothers drove three hundred miles to meet him there. As they left baggage claim, Salahi later wrote in his diary, \u201cmy hands were shackled behind my back and I was encircled by a bunch of ghosts who cut me off from the rest of my company. At first I thought it was an armed robbery,\u201d but, when the airport police approached, \u201cthe guy behind me flashed a magic badge, which immediately made the policemen retreat.\u201d Salahi and his brothers were thrown into the back of a van and driven to a detention site. Before dawn, Salahi was taken to an interrogation room. An American woman, who he assumed was an intelligence officer, entered the room, and stood by as a Senegalese officer questioned him about the Millennium Plot. Salahi denied knowing Ahmed Ressam, and added that he thought the entire narrative around the attack had been concocted \u201cto unlock the terrorism budget and hurt the Muslims.\u201d At the time, he later wrote, \u201cI believed excessively in Conspiracy Theories\u2014though maybe not as much as the U.S. government does.\u201d By the following day, the lead Senegalese officer was convinced that there was no reason to hold Salahi. \u201cI was happy because the one-ton stack of paper the U.S. government had provided the Senegalese about me didn\u2019t seem to impress them,\u201d Salahi wrote. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take my interrogator a whole lot of time to understand the situation.\u201d Another American official arrived, and took Salahi\u2019s photograph and fingerprints. Soon afterward, Salahi\u2019s brothers were released with instructions to return to Mauritania. They were told not to wait for Salahi. Several more days of interrogation followed. The Senegalese did the talking, but the Americans provided the questions and reported back to D.C. Eventually, one of the interrogators told Salahi that he was going to be sent to Mauritania for more questioning. He was terrified\u2014he wanted to go back to Canada, where interrogators behaved within the bounds of the law. Salahi was led to a small private aircraft. The journey to Nouakchott took roughly an hour, tracing the Mauritanian coast\u2014to the left the Atlantic, to the right the Sahara. Salahi, who hadn\u2019t been home since 1993, was filled with nostalgia and dread. \u201cThrough the window I started to see the sand-covered small villages around Nouakchott, as bleak as their prospects,\u201d he wrote. The plane landed at sunset. A security guard handed him a filthy black turban, to hide his face during the drive to the secret-police headquarters. There, an intelligence officer named Yacoub confiscated Salahi\u2019s Quran and left him in a dank cell. He tried to sleep, but his mind was racing with the expectation of torture at dawn. \u201cI\u2019d read about Muslim heroes who faced the death penalty, head up,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow did they do it?\u201d", "The next morning, Salahi was led to the office of the Mauritanian intelligence chief, Deddahi Ould Abdellahi. \u201cThe room was large and well-furnished,\u201d Salahi wrote, with a portrait of the President \u201cconveying the weakness of the law and the strength of the government.\u201d In the course of the next several days, Abdellahi and his men, citing the concerns of the American government, interrogated Salahi about his time in Afghanistan, his contact with his cousin Abu Hafs, and the Millennium Plot. The men never abused Salahi, but, as the days became weeks, he wished that they would just turn him over to the United States, where, he assumed, he could at least challenge the legal grounds of his detention. After roughly three weeks, F.B.I. agents visited Salahi\u2019s cell. Their questions were much the same, Salahi wrote, but \u201cthe whole environmental setup made me very skeptical toward the honesty and humanity of the U.S. interrogators. It was kind of like, \u2018We ain\u2019t gonna beat you ourselves, but you know where you are!\u2019 So I knew the FBI wanted to interrogate me under the pressure and threat of a non-democratic country.\u201d On February 19, 2000, Abdellahi let him go home. \u201cWe had done all our investigations, and we found nothing against Salahi,\u201d Abdellahi told me. Abdellahi\u2019s men confiscated his passport, once again citing a request by the Americans. But a friend helped him find work installing Internet routers for a telecommunications company. \u201cIt sucked that I didn\u2019t have the freedom to travel,\u201d Salahi recalled in the military hearing. \u201cBut, hey, I have to cope with it. So far, so good.\u201d Dry Ice", "On a Tuesday afternoon in September, 2001, one of bin Laden\u2019s messengers sought out Salahi\u2019s cousin, Abu Hafs, and told him to keep an eye on the news. Abu Hafs was back in Afghanistan, living with his family in Kandahar. It had been five years since the Taliban had taken over most of the country, and televisions were banned. He grabbed his shortwave radio. In the U.S., it was morning. He knew what he expected to hear. The first rumors of a \u201cplanes operation\u201d began circulating among Al Qaeda leaders in 1999. But it wasn\u2019t until two years later that bin Laden shared with the Shura Council the broad outlines of the attack: four planes; two civilian targets; two government targets. In that meeting, Abu Hafs challenged bin Laden on Quranic grounds, arguing that the scale of civilian casualties could not be justified in Islam. He added that such an attack would be a betrayal of Al Qaeda\u2019s agreement with the Taliban government, which had provided sanctuary for the group on the understanding that it would do nothing to provoke a full-scale U.S. invasion. Later that summer, Abu Hafs wrote a twelve-page dissent, but bin Laden bristled at his defiance, and the objections of other Al Qaeda leaders, and moved forward. In July, 2001, according to Scott-Clark and Levy, the authors of \u201cThe Exile,\u201d Abu Hafs handed bin Laden his resignation letter. Bin Laden, wary of Al Qaeda\u2019s fragility, urged him not to speak publicly of his departure. For the next two months, Abu Hafs taught jihadi recruits at a madrassa. After the attacks, Cofer Black, the head of the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center, who had served as the agency\u2019s Khartoum station chief while bin Laden was in Sudan, assured President George W. Bush that men like Abu Hafs would soon \u201chave flies walking across their eyeballs.\u201d The next day, he ordered Gary Schroen, the agency\u2019s former Kabul station chief, to gather a team for a paramilitary mission. \u201cI want to see photos of their heads on pikes,\u201d Black said, according to Schroen\u2019s memoir, \u201cFirst In,\u201d published in 2005. \u201cI want bin Ladin\u2019s head shipped back in a box filled with dry ice. I want to be able to show bin Ladin\u2019s head to the President.\u201d Black added that he and Bush wanted to avoid the spectacle of a courtroom trial. \u201cIt was the first time in my thirty-year CIA career that I had ever heard an order to kill someone,\u201d Schroen wrote. On September 26th, Schroen and six other officers loaded an aging Soviet helicopter with weapons, tactical gear, and three million dollars in used, nonconsecutive bills. They took off from Uzbekistan and flew into northern Afghanistan, over the snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Kush. There, Schroen contacted the leaders of the Northern Alliance, an armed group that had spent years fighting the Taliban, with little external support. Schroen recalled, \u201cWhen I began to distribute money\u2014two hundred thousand dollars here, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this\u2014I think that they were convinced that we were sincere.\u201d In the next few weeks, Schroen\u2019s C.I.A. team and their Afghan counterparts travelled through much of northern Afghanistan, laying the groundwork for the U.S. military invasion.", "In Nouakchott, Abdellahi\u2019s men detained Salahi again in the fall of 2001, at the request of the Americans. \u201cI really have no questions for you, because I know your case,\u201d Abdellahi told him. Salahi had deleted the contents of his phone. \u201cAll I had were some numbers of business partners in Mauritania and Germany,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want the U.S. government harassing those peaceful people just because I had their numbers in my phone.\u201d One of the contacts was listed as \u201cP.C. Laden\u201d\u2014German for \u201ccomputer shop\u201d\u2014and he figured that, to the Americans, \u201cLaden\u201d would be a red flag. A couple of weeks into his detention, two F.B.I. agents walked into the cell. \u201cWhere is Abu Hafs?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cI am not in Afghanistan,\u201d Salahi replied. How could he possibly know? The interrogations always circled back to the Millennium Plot. Salahi came to think of his interrogators as acting out a Mauritanian folktale in which a blind man is given the gift of a single, fleeting glimpse of the world. \u201cAll he saw was a rat,\u201d Salahi wrote. \u201cAfter that, whenever anybody tried to explain anything to the guy, he always asked, \u2018Compare it with the rat: Is it bigger? smaller?\u2019 \u201d One of the F.B.I. agents threatened Salahi with torture, and tried to intimidate him. \u201cHe said he was going to bring in black people,\u201d Salahi recalled, in the military hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with black people\u2014half my country is black people!\u201d But the agent kept using racial slurs. \u201cThis was my first time hearing these words,\u201d Salahi said. \u201cLike, what is a \u2018motherfucker\u2019? That is not appropriate language, man. He was very silly. He told me he hated Jews also. . . . I told him I have no problem with the Jews, either, man. Anyway, he said, \u2018I know you are part of the Millennium Plot.\u2019 \u201d A few days later, Salahi was released. Abdellahi called Salahi\u2019s boss at the telecommunications company, to assure him that Salahi should be allowed to resume work. While in custody, Salahi had befriended Yacoub, the intelligence officer who had been one of his guards. Yacoub had a large family and a small salary, so, when Salahi was released, he started paying Yacoub to do occasional tasks. Though Salahi was a skilled electrician, he hired Yacoub to fix his TV.", "Not long afterward, in mid-November, Salahi\u2019s boss sent him to Mauritania\u2019s Presidential palace, to install Internet routers and update the phones. \u201cI thought there would be a lot of formalities, especially for a \u2018terrorist suspect\u2019 such as myself, but nothing like that happened,\u201d Salahi wrote. \u201cAfter all, only the Americans suspect me of terrorism, no other country. The irony is that I have never been in the States, and all the other countries I have been in kept saying, \u2018The guy is alright.\u2019 \u201d After work, Salahi went to his mother\u2019s house. Two intelligence officers, including Yacoub, arrived and said that Abdellahi needed to see him again. One of the arresting agents suggested that Salahi drive his own car to the station, so that he could drive himself home afterward. Yacoub climbed into the passenger seat. \u201cSalahi, I wish I were not part of this shit,\u201d he said. Neither of them knew that the United States had asked Mauritania\u2019s President to hand over Salahi to a rendition team. \u201cHe was guilty of nothing,\u201d Abdellahi told me, and he had not been charged with a crime. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had previously let him go.\u201d But, Abdellahi continued, shrugging, \u201cto refuse a demand from an intelligence agency, in the fight against terrorism\u2014that would have been impossible.\u201d On the evening of November 28th\u2014Mauritania\u2019s Independence Day\u2014Salahi had been in custody for a week. Abdellahi had bought him a new outfit, but Salahi had refused to eat, and the fabric was loose on his shoulders. They drove to the airport in silence, in Abdellahi\u2019s black Mercedes. \u201cHe was not happy\u2014he didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Abdellahi told me. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t the decider. I was an agent of the state. I executed orders. And I knew that the request was justified, because he had connections in this milieu, these Islamo-terrorist circles, and he might be able to give his captors some ideas of how to improve security. That was my thinking\u2014that he was sufficiently intelligent and well informed to help any intelligence service that might ask him for help.\u201d It was Ramadan again. \u201cI pictured my family already having prepared the Iftar fast-breaking food, my mom mumbling her prayers while duly working the modest delicacies, everybody looking for the sun to take its last steps and hide beneath the horizon,\u201d Salahi wrote. He and Abdellahi knelt on the runway, and prayed together. A private jet landed, and out climbed a Jordanian rendition team. The lead officer couldn\u2019t speak Mauritania\u2019s Hassaniya Arabic, and Abdellahi hardly understood the Jordanian dialect, so Salahi translated for them. \u201cHe said he needs fuel,\u201d Salahi explained to Abdellahi. (In his diary, Salahi wrote, \u201cI was eager to let my predator know, I am, I am.\u201d) When the conversation was over, the Jordanians blindfolded Salahi and put a set of soundproof earmuffs on him. Salahi was terrified. \u201cI thought it was a new U.S. method to suck intels out of your brain and send them directly to a main computer which analyzes the information,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was silly, but if you get scared you are not you anymore. You very much become a child again.\u201d", "In Amman, Jordan, Salahi was hooded and taken to a detention facility in the headquarters of the country\u2019s General Intelligence Directorate. (After 9/11, the directorate acted as a proxy jailer for the C.I.A.) The interrogations covered the same topics as before: Abu Hafs; Al Qaeda\u2019s training camps in 1992; the Millennium Plot. The Americans supplied the questions, and the Jordanians extracted the responses, often through coercive means. Salahi was asked about innocuous exchanges from intercepted e-mails and phone calls, as if they had been conducted in code. At other times, the questions originated from material on his hard drive, which the F.B.I. had copied in Nouakchott. Once, on a technical assignment, Salahi had been photographed near the President of Mauritania; now the lead interrogator accused Salahi of having plotted to kill him. Still, Salahi found his Jordanian interrogators to be highly knowledgeable, and they developed a kind of mutual respect. \u201cIt is a fact that they understand this whole concept of terrorism much better than the average American interrogator,\u201d Salahi said, in his military hearing. \u201cThey really know who is who,\u201d and, as a result, \u201cthey were very reluctant to torture me. It was not every day, the torture\u2014I would say maybe twice a week.\u201d While other detainees were mercilessly beaten, strung up by their limbs, and sexually assaulted, he added, \u201call they did was strike me at different times in the face, and hit me against the concrete wall.\u201d The guards, who were officially prohibited from interacting with him, began asking questions. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d one of them said. \u201cMauritania.\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing in Jordan?\u201d \u201cMy country turned me over.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d \u201cI ordered my meal more than an hour ago! Since then, I have received it, eaten it, and paid for it! Thank you for a wonderful evening!\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYour country is fucked up.\u201d The guards also brought him books from the library, including the Bible, which he had requested, he wrote, \u201cbecause I wanted to study the book that must more or less have shaped the lives of the Americans.\u201d Every other week, when Red Cross representatives visited the prison, Salahi and a handful of other C.I.A. detainees were whisked to the cellar, to be hidden from view. In Nouakchott, Abdellahi waited for updates from the C.I.A. and the G.I.D., but received none. \u201cI thought he\u2019d be back in no time,\u201d he told me. Salahi\u2019s family wasn\u2019t notified of his rendition, and so they were surprised that Abdellahi refused to let them see him. According to one of Salahi\u2019s brothers, Abdellahi told the family that Salahi was being kept in a detention facility in the desert, far from Nouakchott. (Abdellahi says that, after Salahi disappeared, the family never contacted him.) To insure Salahi\u2019s upkeep, the family regularly gave Abdellahi\u2019s men money, food, clothes, and gifts. In return, they passed along messages from Salahi, which they had invented, and assured the family that Salahi was well.", "In Kandahar, Abu Hafs felt the Americans closing in. The Taliban was rapidly losing ground. On October 17, 2001, Abu Hafs\u2019s madrassa took a direct hit from a missile. One day in November, after burying several friends, Abu Hafs sought out an Al Jazeera journalist. His turban was still damp from where his wife had cleaned off other people\u2019s blood. \u201cThe Americans, with their policies, bore the fruit of the events of September 11th,\u201d Abu Hafs said on camera. \u201cStriking horror, panic, and fear in the hearts of the enemies of Allah is a divine commandment.\u201d He added that American citizens should blame their law-enforcement and intelligence agencies\u2014with their \u201csatellites, ground stations, millions of spies, and huge budgets\u201d\u2014for the fact that the hijackers had \u201cfound a security breach as big as a whole fleet of hijacked civilian aircraft, and managed to shove America\u2019s nose into the ground.\u201d By the second week of December, it was clear that Kandahar would fall. Bin Laden had fled to the mountains, and the remaining Al Qaeda leaders understood that, as Arabs and North Africans, they could never blend in with the locals, who spoke Dari, Pashto, Balochi, and other regional languages. (For the first several weeks of the invasion, Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, believed that everyone spoke \u201cAfghan.\u201d) In a rush to leave Kandahar, two dozen senior Al Qaeda officials boarded a bus, but Abu Hafs, fearful that a single air strike could decapitate the jihadi movement, urged them to disperse. During the next several days, Abu Hafs travelled toward the Pakistani province of Balochistan. He slept in remote villages, and entrusted his life to Afghan sheepherders who were presumably unaware of the twenty-five-million-dollar bounty on his head. He wrote a letter to his wife and children, but there was no way to send it, and so he kept it in a pocket in his robes. When Abu Hafs reached Quetta, in Pakistan, he found the city\u2019s private hospital filled with injured Al Qaeda members. Taliban fighters walked the streets, confident in the support they received from Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service. Abu Hafs, however, regarded the Pakistanis as duplicitous. (The C.I.A. came to much the same conclusion.) Bin Laden\u2019s family was en route to Pakistan, and Abu Hafs needed to make arrangements for their protection. In deliberations with Al Qaeda leaders, he decided that the safest place was Iran. On December 19th, Abu Hafs boarded a bus in Quetta, carrying a fake passport and a suitcase full of cash. An image of bin Laden\u2019s face adorned the windshield, and Abu Hafs spent much of the journey to the Iranian border, some four hundred miles, wondering whether it was a \u201cWanted\u201d poster or a tribute. At a Pakistani Army checkpoint, he slipped a wad of bills into his passport, and went through unquestioned. In Iran, Abu Hafs was greeted by representatives of a secretive and \u00e9lite Revolutionary Guard Corps unit that is responsible for protecting top officials. A few weeks later, Iranian spies told Abu Hafs to call other Al Qaeda officials and inform them that they would be welcome in Iran\u2014although, like him, they would live with their wives and children under a form of house arrest, sometimes in prisons, sometimes in lavish compounds and hotels, always in the company of the Revolutionary Guard. The decision to simultaneously protect and detain Al Qaeda members was apparently made by Iran\u2019s spy chief, Qassem Suleimani. Within a few months, dozens of Al Qaeda members were living in Tehran, undergoing occasional interrogations, aware that their Iranian hosts could betray them at any moment. Abu Hafs spent the next decade in relative luxury, exercising alongside foreign diplomats in one of Tehran\u2019s swankiest gyms, and looking after bin Laden\u2019s sons along with his own. The Pentagon had reported that he was dead.", "On the night of July 19, 2002, the Jordanians transported Mohamedou Salahi, blindfolded and in chains, to the airport in Amman, where a new team took over. At first, Salahi was relieved\u2014he assumed that the Americans had come to understand his irrelevance to 9/11 and the Millennium Plot, and that he was being sent back to Mauritania. Instead, the men stripped him naked, strapped a diaper on him, and swapped out his shackles for a heavier set. One of the men momentarily removed Salahi\u2019s blindfold, and shined a flashlight into his eyes. Everyone on the team was dressed entirely in black, their faces obscured by balaclavas. They drove up to the stairs of an airplane, but, Salahi wrote, he was \u201cso exhausted, sick, and tired that I couldn\u2019t walk, which compelled the escort to pull me up the steps like a dead body.\u201d At sunrise, the plane landed at Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan. For the first time, Salahi was in the custody of uniformed American soldiers. \u201cWhere is Mullah Omar?\u201d they asked. \u201cWhere is Osama bin Laden?\u201d They shouted and threw objects against the wall. Salahi had been living in a cell practically since the beginning of the invasion, nine months earlier. Military personnel took his biometric information, and logged his health problems\u2014including a damaged sciatic nerve\u2014then led him to a cell. The punishment for talking to another detainee was to be hung by the wrists, feet barely touching the ground. Salahi saw a mentally ill old man subjected to this method. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t stop talking because he didn\u2019t know where he was, nor why,\u201d Salahi wrote. During interrogations, an intelligence officer, known among the detainees as William the Torturer, forced Salahi into stress positions that exacerbated his sciatic-nerve issues. \u201cHis specialty was in brutalizing detainees who were considered important, but not valuable enough to get them tickets to the secret CIA prisons,\u201d Salahi wrote. Another officer tried to build rapport with Salahi by speaking to him in German. \u201cWahrheit macht frei,\u201d the officer said\u2014the truth sets you free. \u201cWhen I heard him say that, I knew the truth wouldn\u2019t set me free, because \u2018Arbeit \u2019 didn\u2019t set the Jews free,\u201d Salahi recalled. (The phrase \u201cWork sets you free\u201d appeared on the gates of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps.) Each detainee was given a number, and, on August 4th, thirty-four of those numbers were called, including Salahi\u2019s. The men were dragged out of their cells. Military police officers put blackout goggles over their eyes and mittens on their hands, then hooded them, lined them up, and tied each detainee to the one in front of him and the one behind him. Then the men were loaded onto an airplane. \u201cWhen my turn came, two guards grabbed me by the hands and feet and threw me toward the reception team,\u201d Salahi wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t remember whether I hit the floor or was caught by the other guards. I had started to lose feeling and it would have made no difference anyway.\u201d For some thirty hours, Salahi was strapped to a board. Medical records indicate that he weighed a hundred and nine pounds\u2014around thirty per cent less than his normal weight. He was belted so tightly that he struggled to breathe, but he didn\u2019t have the English vocabulary to tell the guards. Then, he wrote, the plane landed, the doors opened, and \u201cthe warm Cuban sun hit me gracefully. It was such a good feeling.\u201d ENEMY COMBATANTS \u201cThe screen porch makes it a home.\u201d", "In the minutes before the first detainees set foot on Guant\u00e1namo, \u201cyou could literally hear a pin drop,\u201d Brandon Neely, a military-police officer, recalled, in an interview with the Guant\u00e1namo Testimonials Project, at the University of California, Davis, in 2008. \u201cEveryone, including myself, was very nervous,\u201d he said. It was January 11, 2002. The Bush Administration had decided that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the war on terror, which meant that the men captured abroad could be deprived of the rights of prisoners of war. That day, Neely\u2019s job was to haul captives from a bus to a holding area for processing, and then to small, outdoor cages, where they would spend nearly four months sleeping on rocks, and relieving themselves in buckets, while soldiers constructed more permanent cellblocks. \u201cI keep thinking, Here it comes\u2014I am fixing to see what a terrorist looks like face to face,\u201d Neely, who was twenty-one at the time, said. The first man off the bus had only one leg. He wore handcuffs, leg shackles, earmuffs, blackout goggles, a surgical mask, and a bright-orange jumpsuit. As two M.P.s dragged him to the holding area, someone tossed his prosthetic leg out of the bus. All afternoon, guards screamed at the detainees to shut up and walk faster, called them \u201csand niggers,\u201d and said that their family members and countries had been obliterated by nuclear bombs. Later that day, Neely and his partner brought an elderly detainee to the holding area and forced him to his knees. When they removed his shackles, the man, who was shaking with fear, suddenly jerked to the left. Neely jumped on top of him, and forced his face into the concrete floor. An officer shouted \u201cCode Red!\u201d into a radio, and the Internal Reaction Force team raced to the scene and hog-tied him. He was left for hours in the Caribbean sun. Neely later found out that the elderly detainee had jerked because, when he was forced to his knees, he thought he was about to be shot in the back of the head. In his home country, Neely said, \u201cthis man had seen some of his friends and family members executed on their knees.\u201d The man\u2019s response was hardly unique; a military document, drafted ten days later for the base commander, noted that \u201cthe detainees think they are being taken to be shot.\u201d Officially, the job of the Internal Reaction Force was to restrain unruly detainees, to prevent them from injuring themselves or the guards. But, in practice, \u201cIRFing\u201d was often done as a form of revenge, initiated liberally\u2014for example, when a detainee was found to have two plastic cups instead of one, or refused to drink a bottle of Ensure, because he thought that he was being given poison. IRFing typically involved a team of six or more men dressed in riot gear: the first man would pepper-spray the detainee, then charge into the cell and, using a heavy shield and his body weight, tackle the detainee; the rest would jump on top, shackling or binding the detainee until he was no longer moving. Although many of the detainees arrived malnourished, with their bodies marked by bullet wounds and broken bones, some IRF teams punched them and slammed their heads into the ground until they were bloody and unconscious. \u201cYou could always tell when someone got IRFed, as the detainees throughout the camp would start chanting and screaming,\u201d Neely recalled. Once, he watched an IRF team leader beat a detainee so badly that he had to be sent to the hospital and the floor of his cell was stained with blood; the next time the team leader was in the cellblock, another detainee yelled out, \u201cSergeant, have you come back to finish him off?\u201d In Islam, the Quran is considered the transcribed word of God; some Muslims keep the book wrapped in cloth, never letting it touch unclean surfaces. To dispel notions that the United States was at war with Islam, detainees were allowed to have private meetings with a Muslim military chaplain, and were given copies of the Quran. Some guards saw an opportunity to torment the detainees\u2014by tossing the Quran into the toilet, for example, or by breaking the binding under the guise of searching for \u201cweapons.\u201d Desecration of the Quran provoked riots in the cellblocks, which resulted in IRF teams storming into the cells and beating up detainees. One day, after an interrogator kicked a Quran across the floor, detainees organized a mass suicide attempt. \u201cOnce every fifteen minutes, a prisoner tried to hang himself by tying his sheet around his neck and fastening it through the mesh of the cage wall,\u201d James Yee, an Army captain who served as the Muslim chaplain in Guant\u00e1namo, recalled in his memoir, \u201cFor God and Country,\u201d from 2005. \u201cAs soon as the prisoner was taken to the hospital, another detainee would be found\u2014his sheet wound around his neck and tied to his cage wall. The guards would rush in to save him and the chaos would start again. The protest lasted for several days as twenty-three prisoners tried to hang themselves.\u201d Military-police officers so frequently abused the Quran during cell searches that detainees demanded that the books be kept in the library, where they would be safe. Yee, who had converted to Islam in the early nineties, sent a request up the chain of command, but was rebuffed. \u201cI felt this decision stemmed from the command\u2019s desire to be able to tell the media that we gave all detainees a Quran out of sensitivity to their religious needs,\u201d he wrote. The detainees protested, and so \u201cit was decided that every detainee who refused the Quran would be IRFed.\u201d While the detainees were receiving medical treatment for their post-IRF injuries, the Qurans were placed back in their cells. In time, Yee came to believe that \u201cIslam was systematically used as a weapon against the prisoners.\u201d Guards mocked the call to prayer, and manipulated Islamic principles of modesty\u2014by having female guards watch naked detainees in the showers, for example\u2014to create tension as an excuse to exact violence. During interrogations, detainees were forced to perform mock satanic rituals, or were draped in the Israeli flag. Donald Rumsfeld told reporters that the men in Guant\u00e1namo were \u201camong the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.\u201d But after Brandon Neely\u2019s first shift, on the day the detention camp opened, \u201cno one really spoke much,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI went back to my tent and laid down to go to sleep. I was thinking, Those were the worst people the world had to offer?\u201d", "Investigators had the same question. Shortly before the first detainees arrived, Robert McFadden, an N.C.I.S. special agent, was eager to receive the flight manifest. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait to see who the detainees were,\u201d he told me. He had spent much of the past fifteen months in Yemen, investigating Al Qaeda\u2019s bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and hoped that some of the men who were being shipped to Guant\u00e1namo would have information about the case. But, when the list of detainees finally arrived, he recalled, \u201cmy reaction was, What the fuck? Who are these guys?\u201d Most of the names were Afghan or Pakistani, \u201cand the Arabs who were on the list certainly weren\u2019t recognizable to me and my colleagues who had been working Al Qaeda for years.\u201d A few weeks later, after McFadden visited the detention camp, he concluded that the detainees were \u201cessentially nobodies.\u201d He told me, \u201cThere was not anyone approaching even the most liberal interpretation of a \u2018high-value detainee.\u2019 \u201d In Afghanistan, the U.S. military was inadvertently presiding over a kidnapping-and-ransom industry. Helicopters dropped flyers in remote Afghan villages, offering \u201cwealth and power beyond your dreams\u201d to anyone who turned in a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. \u201cYou can receive millions of dollars,\u201d one of the flyers said. \u201cThis is enough money to take care of your family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life.\u201d A common bounty was five thousand dollars\u2014far more money than most Afghans earned in a year\u2014and \u201cthe result was an explosion of human trafficking\u201d by various armed groups, Mark Fallon, the deputy commander of Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s Criminal Investigation Task Force, wrote in his memoir, \u201cUnjustifiable Means,\u201d which was heavily redacted before being published, in 2017. As Michael Lehnert, a Marine Corps major general who briefly served as the detention camp\u2019s first commander, later testified to Congress, \u201cWhat better way to enrich yourself, while resolving old grudges, than to finger a neighbor who was your enemy, regardless of his support for either Al Qaeda or the Taliban?\u201d According to Fallon, \u201cThe Northern Alliance would jam so many detainees into Conex shipping containers that they started to die of suffocation. Not wanting to lose their bounties, the captors sprayed the tops of the boxes with machine guns to open ventilation holes. A lot of these prisoners were actually looking forward to being handed over to the Americans, figuring it would be pretty obvious they weren\u2019t Al Qaeda.\u201d Yet hundreds of them were sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, which ended up housing seven hundred and eighty people. In public, the Bush Administration and its military leadership asserted that Guant\u00e1namo was filled with men who would stop at nothing to destroy the U.S. But, on the base, Fallon and his colleagues referred to most detainees as \u201cdirt farmers.\u201d Lehnert lamented, \u201cIt takes an Army captain to send someone to Gitmo, and the President of the United States to get them out.\u201d", "Salahi was no dirt farmer. But the C.I.A., which spent the next few years shuffling its \u201chigh-value detainees\u201d among so-called black sites in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, had seen fit to transfer him into military custody. By the time Salahi arrived at Guant\u00e1namo, on August 5, 2002, Fallon\u2019s \u00e9lite interagency criminal-investigation task force had been sidelined, and Lehnert had been replaced. The leadership at Guant\u00e1namo was more interested in intelligence collection than in prosecuting detainees for terrorism crimes. But, when the new commander asked Stuart Herrington, a retired colonel and Army intelligence officer, to assess operations at the facility, Herrington found that most interrogators lacked the training and the experience required to be effective. Only one of the twenty-six interrogators was capable of working without an interpreter. Herrington later reported that the interrogators were unsure of the real names of more than half the detainees. According to Fallon, most of the interrogators were \u201cbasically conscripts\u201d who would \u201cwalk into a room for the first time thinking the detainee was just waiting to be cracked open and they were the next Jack Bauer,\u201d the fictional protagonist of \u201c24,\u201d who used abusive tactics to elicit information and save his city from terrorist attacks. They went through checklists of questions that had been developed by their superiors, and seemed impervious to nuance, or to the notion that some detainees may have been sent there in error. In response, detainees would stop co\u00f6perating and start chanting or praying; in an attempt to reassert control, Fallon wrote, \u201cthe interrogators would duct-tape their mouths, further guaranteeing that they wouldn\u2019t get any information\u2014and so it would go.\u201d Nevertheless, he recalled, each failed interrogation \u201cwas taken as proof that the detainees were both Al Qaeda and trained to resist these methods.\u201d In 2000, investigators in northern England had discovered a jihadi field manual that included advice on lying to captors. Now, faced with their own incompetence, Fallon wrote, interrogators \u201cwere quick to blame \u2018classic Manchester resistance tactics!\u2019 \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done it, Igor! I\u2019ve finally found a way to reuse all our wine corks!\u201d Salahi\u2019s detainee dossier lists his \u201creasons for transfer\u201d to Guant\u00e1namo: \u201cto provide information\u201d on the Al Qaeda training camp he had attended in 1992; a separate Afghan militia, which had received substantial backing from the C.I.A.; mosques in Duisburg; and his cousin Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. (They were no longer brothers-in-law, as Salahi and his wife had divorced.) Notably absent is any mention of the Millennium Plot, or any allegation that Salahi had committed a crime. After Salahi was processed, he spent thirty days in a cold isolation cell, a practice that the U.S. government considered \u201ca main building block of the exploitation process,\u201d as it \u201callows the captor total control over personal inputs.\u201d When the isolation period was over, Salahi learned from other detainees that there was a difference in opinion between those who had lived in European democracies and those who had lived only in Muslim countries, with the latter group arguing that America\u2019s war on terror was an anti-Muslim crusade. Salahi tried to convince the skeptics that their arrival in Cuba was \u201ca blessing,\u201d and that they would be treated fairly and exonerated by the American justice system. But, \u201cwith every day going by, the optimists lost ground,\u201d he wrote. Bush Administration lawyers had taken the position that \u201cenemy combatants\u201d could be held indefinitely, without trials, and that in order for something to qualify as \u201ctorture\u201d it \u201cmust be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.\u201d By the end of the following year, Salahi knew more about classified security operations than any private American citizen. The gulf between the U.S. government\u2019s public disclosures and its secret practices was etched into his body and his mind.", "In 1967, Martin Seligman, a twenty-four-year-old Ph.D. student in psychology, conducted an experiment that involved delivering electric shocks to dogs in various states of restraint. The goal was to assess whether inescapable pain could condition an animal into \u201clearned helplessness,\u201d whereby it simply accepts its fate. Thirty-five years later, the United States government drew inspiration from this experiment in its approach to interrogating terror suspects. The plan, conceived by James Mitchell, a psychologist working on contract for the C.I.A., was to induce learned helplessness in humans by combining an individually tailored regimen of torture techniques with environmental manipulation. The techniques\u2014which government documents identify as \u201comnipotence tactics,\u201d \u201cdegradation tactics,\u201d \u201cdebilitation tactics,\u201d and \u201cmonopolization of perception tactics\u201d\u2014had been developed by Communist forces during the Korean War, to coerce prisoners into making false confessions, for propaganda purposes. Since then, the U.S. military has exposed some \u00e9lite soldiers to the techniques, to prepare them for the kinds of abuses they might encounter should they be captured by terrorist groups or governments that don\u2019t abide by the Geneva Conventions. Mitchell argued that, by reverse-engineering this program, interrogators could overwhelm whatever resistance training a detainee might have absorbed from the Manchester manual. What followed was a period of experimentation\u2014overseen by psychologists, lawyers, and medical personnel\u2014at C.I.A. black sites and military facilities. In September, 2002, Army officers started referring to Guant\u00e1namo as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Battle Lab.\u201d Early in the afternoon of October 2, 2002, a group of interagency lawyers and psychologists met to come up with a framework that used \u201cpsychological stressors\u201d and environmental manipulation to \u201cfoster dependence and compliance.\u201d The C.I.A. had been torturing detainees at black sites for several months; now the Guant\u00e1namo leadership wanted to understand the legal gymnastics that would be required to implement a program of their own. \u201cTorture has been prohibited by international law, but the language of the statutes is written vaguely,\u201d Jonathan Fredman, a senior C.I.A. lawyer, said, according to the meeting minutes. \u201cIt is basically subject to perception. If the detainee dies, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d (Fredman has disputed the accuracy of the meeting minutes.) Later that month, a military lawyer named Diane Beaver drafted a legal justification\u2014described later by a congressional inquiry on torture as \u201cprofoundly in error and legally insufficient\u201d\u2014for a set of abusive interrogation techniques. Among such methods as forced nakedness, dietary manipulation, daily twenty-hour interrogations, waterboarding, exposure to freezing temperatures, and the withholding of medical care, Beaver endorsed \u201cthe use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death\u201d was \u201cimminent.\u201d (She later expressed surprise that her legal opinion had become \u201cthe final word on interrogation policies and practices within the Department of Defense.\u201d) An accompanying memo, drafted by a military psychologist and a psychiatrist, explained that \u201call aspects of the environment should enhance capture shock, dislocate expectations, foster dependence, and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible.\u201d In November, 2002, the set of proposed techniques landed on Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s desk. He signed it. \u201cWhy is standing limited to 4 hours?\u201d he wrote in the margin, referring to a proposed stress position. \u201cI stand for 8-10.\u201d", "By the spring of 2003, Salahi had been visited in Guant\u00e1namo by investigators from Canada and Germany, and questioned by various U.S. government agencies. He had come to think of himself as \u201ca dead camel in the desert, when all kinds of bugs start to eat it.\u201d Most of the interrogations were conducted by the F.B.I., whose questions now centered on establishing a connection between Salahi and 9/11. They showed him photos of various hijackers, and one of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the attack co\u00f6rdinator, who had been captured in Pakistan. \u201cI figured I\u2019ve seen the guy, but where and when?\u201d Salahi wrote in his diary. Eventually, Salahi understood that bin al-Shibh was one of the three men who had stayed at his apartment in Germany for a night, in October, 1999; the other two had become 9/11 hijackers. Now bin al-Shibh, who was being tortured in C.I.A. custody, claimed that Salahi had recruited him into Al Qaeda. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d say, without you, September 11th would never have happened,\u201d one of Salahi\u2019s interrogators told him. Salahi was horrified. \u201cI was, like, Maybe he\u2019s right.\u201d (In fact, the 9/11 plot was organized more than a year before bin al-Shibh visited Duisburg.) For the rest of the interrogation session, he was forced to look at photos of corpses from the aftermath of the attacks. On May 22nd, Salahi\u2019s lead F.B.I. interrogator told him that the military would take over his interrogation. \u201cI wish you good luck,\u201d the agent said. \u201cAll I can tell you is to tell the truth.\u201d They hugged. The F.B.I. team left Guant\u00e1namo, and the torture began. Special Projects The cell\u2014better, the box\u2014was cooled down to the point that I was shaking most of the time. I was forbidden from seeing the light of the day; every once in a while they gave me a rec-time at night to keep me from seeing or interacting with any detainees. I was living literally in terror. For the next seventy days I wouldn\u2019t know the sweetness of sleeping.", "Twenty-hour interrogations. \u201cYou know, when you just fall asleep and the saliva starts to come out of your mouth?\u201d Salahi said. No prayers, no information about the direction of Mecca. No showers for weeks. Force-feeding during the daylight hours of Ramadan, when Muslims are supposed to fast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna feed you up your ass,\u201d an interrogator said. Medical personnel had noted that Salahi had sciatic-nerve issues; now interrogators kept him in stress positions that exacerbated them. No chairs, no lying down, no more access to his prescription pain medication. \u201cStand the fuck up!\u201d an interrogator said. But Salahi was shackled to the floor, so he could do so only hunched over. He stayed that way for hours. The next time the Red Cross delegation visited Guant\u00e1namo, a representative reported that \u201cmedical files are being used by interrogators to gain information in developing an interrogation plan.\u201d Female interrogators groped him. They stripped, and rubbed their bodies all over his, and threatened to rape him. \u201cOh, Allah, help me! Oh, Allah, have mercy on me!\u201d one of them said, mockingly. \u201cAllah! Allah! There is no Allah. He let you down!\u201d An interrogation memo listed plans to shave Salahi\u2019s head and beard, dress him in a burqa, and make him bark and perform dog tricks, \u201cto reduce the detainee\u2019s ego and establish control.\u201d The interrogators head-butted him, and made degrading remarks about his religion and his family. They kept him in alternately hot and cold cells, blasted him with strobe lights and heavy-metal music, and poured ice water on him. One day they would deprive him of food, and the next they\u2019d force him to drink water until he vomited. According to interrogation memos, they decorated the walls with photos of genitalia, and set up a baby crib, because he was sensitive about the fact that he had no children. On July 17, 2003, a masked interrogator told Salahi that he had dreamed that he saw other detainees digging a grave and tossing a pine casket with Salahi\u2019s detainee number into it. The interrogator added that, if Salahi didn\u2019t start talking, he would be buried on \u201cChristian, sovereign American soil.\u201d On August 2nd, military records show, an interrogator told Salahi that he and his colleagues \u201care sick of hearing the same lies over and over and over and are seriously considering washing their hands of him. Once they do, he will disappear and never be heard from again.\u201d Salahi was told to imagine \u201cthe worst possible scenario he could end up in,\u201d and that he would \u201csoon disappear down a very dark hole. His very existence will become erased. His electronic files will be deleted from the computer, his paper files will be packed up. . . . No one will know what happened to him, and eventually, no one will care.\u201d That day, the leader of Salahi\u2019s interrogation came in. He identified himself as Captain Collins, a Navy officer who had been sent to Guant\u00e1namo by the White House. (His name was actually Richard Zuley; he was a Chicago police detective, working as a military contractor, who has an extensive record of abusing suspects until they confessed to crimes that they hadn\u2019t committed. He did not respond to requests for comment.) Zuley read Salahi a letter, later shown to be forged, stating that his mother was in U.S. custody and might soon be transferred to Guant\u00e1namo. According to government records, \u201cthe letter referred to \u2018the administrative and logistical difficulties her presence would present in this previously all-male prison environment,\u2019 \u201d implying that she would be raped. On August 13th, Donald Rumsfeld authorized the interrogation plan for Salahi. The document he signed listed one aim of the abuse as to \u201creplicate and exploit the \u2018Stockholm Syndrome,\u2019 \u201d in which kidnapping victims come to trust and feel affection for their captors. Twelve days later, a group of men charged into Salahi\u2019s cell with a snarling German shepherd. They punched Salahi in the face and the ribs, then covered his eyes with blackout goggles, his ears with earmuffs, and his head with a bag. They tightened the chains on his ankles and wrists, then threw him into the back of a truck, drove to the water, and loaded him into a speedboat. \u201cI thought they were going to execute me,\u201d Salahi wrote. He was driven around for three hours, to make him think that he was being transported to a different facility. He was forced to swallow salt water, and, every few minutes, the men packed ice cubes between his clothes and his skin. When the ice melted, they punched him, then repacked the ice to freeze him again. By the end of the boat ride, Salahi was bleeding from his ankles, mouth, and wrists. Seven or eight of his ribs were broken. Back on land, Salahi was carried to Echo Special, the trailer, which would be his home for several years. For the next month, he was kept in total darkness; his only way of knowing day from night was to look into the toilet and see if there was brightness at the end of the drain. \u201cTo be honest I can report very little about the next couple of weeks,\u201d Salahi wrote, \u201cbecause I was not in the right state of mind.\u201d Soon afterward, an interrogator e-mailed Diane Zierhoffer, a military psychologist, with concerns about Salahi\u2019s mental health. \u201cSlahi told me he is \u2018hearing voices\u2019 now,\u201d the interrogator wrote. \u201cIs this something that happens to people who have little external stimulus such as daylight, human interaction etc???? Seems a little creepy.\u201d \u201cSensory deprivation can cause hallucinations, usually visual rather than auditory, but you never know,\u201d Zierhoffer replied. \u201cIn the dark you create things out of what little you have.\u201d", "\u201cHad I done what they accused me of, I would have relieved myself on day one,\u201d Salahi wrote in his diary. \u201cBut the problem is that you cannot just admit to something you haven\u2019t done; you need to deliver the details, which you can\u2019t when you hadn\u2019t done anything. It\u2019s not just, \u2018Yes, I did!\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t work that way: you have to make up a complete story that makes sense to the dumbest dummies. One of the hardest things to do is to tell an untruthful story and maintain it, and that is exactly where I was stuck.\u201d On September 8th, Salahi asked to speak to Zuley. By now, he had enough information about the kind of story he had to craft, because, he wrote, \u201cthrough my conversations with the FBI and the DoD, I had a good idea as to what wild theories the government had about me.\u201d Zuley walked in, and Salahi started lying. But it wasn\u2019t enough; the government wanted him to link other people in Canada to various plots. Salahi figured that this was how bin al-Shibh had ended up naming him as a high-level Al Qaeda recruiter. He recalled, \u201cI took the pen and paper and wrote all kinds of incriminating lies about a poor person who was just seeking refuge in Canada and trying to make some money so he could start a family. Moreover, he is handicapped. I felt so bad, and kept praying silently, \u2018Nothing\u2019s gonna happen to you dear brother.\u2019 \u201d The abuse wound down slowly\u2014no more hitting, but no \u201ccomfort items,\u201d either, and no uninterrupted periods of rest. James Mitchell, the C.I.A. contract psychologist who devised the enhanced-interrogation program, describes this period as an element of \u201cPavlovian conditioning,\u201d in which the detainee sees his situation improve or deteriorate in direct accordance with his level of compliance. One day, Zuley walked into Salahi\u2019s cell, carrying a pillow. In time, he was given back his pain medication. Then he was prescribed antidepressants. In mid-November, Salahi voluntarily sat for a polygraph test. The examiner described Salahi, whose answers contradicted everything he had confessed to Zuley in the preceding weeks, as \u201ceager to prove that he is providing accurate information.\u201d The results were decisive: \u201cNo deception indicated.\u201d", "On February 14, 2004, Salahi received a short letter from his mother in Mauritania, informing him that her \u201chealth situation is OK.\u201d It had been eight hundred and fifteen days since he had seen her\u2014an ailing woman in the rearview mirror, waving from the street as he drove to Deddahi Abdellahi\u2019s intelligence headquarters. In all this time, his family had had no official confirmation of his whereabouts. Salahi\u2019s brother, who is a German citizen, had read in Der Spiegel that he was in Guant\u00e1namo, but Abdellahi insisted that it wasn\u2019t true\u2014that he was looking after Salahi in a Mauritanian prison. Meanwhile, his subordinates continued to collect bribes from Salahi\u2019s family. Mohamed Elmoustapha Ould Badre Eddine, a left-wing member of the Mauritanian Parliament, conducted inquiries of his own, but made no progress. Badre Eddine had spent some four decades organizing grassroots campaigns against the practice of slavery and other human-rights violations, and for this he had spent years in remote detention sites, under a succession of authoritarian regimes. Throughout 2002 and 2003, whenever the foreign minister visited the parliamentary chamber, Badre Eddine demanded to know Salahi\u2019s whereabouts. Each time, the minister lied\u2014even after the Red Cross had started delivering Salahi\u2019s letters from Guant\u00e1namo to his family. In 2005, Mauritania had a military coup\u2014the typical way in which power has changed hands since independence. \u201cEach government claims that it has come to the rescue of the population, which had been neglected and abused by the previous government,\u201d Badre Eddine told me. \u201cAnd then it behaves the same way as the last.\u201d When he asked the new regime about Salahi, he said, \u201cthey just replied, \u2018We didn\u2019t kidnap him\u2014it was the previous government that did it. And now he belongs to the Americans.\u2019 \u201d From the floor of Parliament, Badre Eddine noted that Mauritania has no extradition treaty with the United States. \u201cHe was a victim of an extremely rare crime: that a country had kidnapped its own citizen and handed it over to a foreign country, outside of the justice system, outside of all legal processes,\u201d Brahim Ebety, the Salahi family\u2019s lawyer in Nouakchott, told me. Under the new regime, Abdellahi, the spy chief, was demoted, and given the task of investigating corruption and malfeasance within the security services; the standard path for accountability required Abdellahi to investigate himself.", "Steve Wood walked into Echo Special in the spring of 2004 unaware of everything that had happened before. His was the first guard force that didn\u2019t wear masks, that allowed Salahi to pray. Outside of the political discussions, he and Salahi passed the hours playing rummy, Risk, and chess. When Salahi\u2019s female interrogators came in for a game of Monopoly, Salahi always threw the match. \u201cMy interest is not to be tortured,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Steve\u2019s interest is to impress the girls. So, completely different goals in life.\u201d Sometimes Wood opened Salahi\u2019s Quran to a random page and told him the verse number, and Salahi would recite it aloud from memory, first in Arabic, then in English. It was the first time Wood had encountered the Quran. He wanted to ask Salahi more about its contents, but he suspected that there were microphones and cameras in the cell. Outside Echo Special, Wood started reading about Guant\u00e1namo on activist Web sites, but a colleague warned him that Internet traffic was monitored on the base. He began to worry that awareness among his co-workers of his increasingly complex feelings toward Salahi might elicit accusations that he was unpatriotic, or an insider threat. \u201cI tried to make my time there morally neutral, without being called a traitor,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was scared to ask too many questions, I was scared to read a book on Islam while I was in there, or show too much interest.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019d like, I can set you up with a bullet I dodged.\u201d Wood\u2019s concerns were not unjustified. While Salahi was being tortured, James Yee, the Muslim military chaplain, discovered that he and the interpreters at Guant\u00e1namo\u2014many of whom were Muslim Americans, with Middle Eastern backgrounds\u2014were being spied on by law-enforcement and intelligence officers. When Yee went on leave, he flew to Jacksonville, Florida, where he was interrogated and arrested, then blindfolded, earmuffed, and driven to a Navy brig in South Carolina. For seventy-six days, he lived in solitary confinement, in a cold cell with surveillance cameras and the lights always on. Government officials suggested that Yee was running an elaborate spy ring\u2014that he and other Muslims had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the military, and represented the gravest insider threat since the Cold War. Based on a misreading of materials in his possession, and the vague aspersions of Islamophobic military officers, prosecutors accused him of treason and \u201caiding the enemy,\u201d and threatened to pursue the death penalty. (All charges were later dropped, and Yee was honorably discharged.) In October, 2004, Wood\u2019s girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Summer. Seven months later, his deployment ended. Before leaving Guant\u00e1namo, he gave Salahi a novel by Steve Martin, \u201cThe Pleasure of My Company.\u201d \u201cPillow, good luck with your situation,\u201d he wrote inside. \u201cJust remember Allah always has a plan. I hope you think of us as more than just guards. I think we all became friends.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t sure that Salahi believed him. \u201cThe whole time I was thinking, you know, What does he really think of us?\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhat if he is, like, \u2018I hate these sons of bitches for locking me up\u2019? And Mohamedou probably thought I was thinking the same thing\u2014that, to me, he was just a job, and nothing more.\u201d So, during one of his final shifts, Wood broke protocol and showed Salahi a photo of Summer. \u201cIt was my way of telling him, \u2018Man, I trust you. This is my daughter. She is my life. This friendship is real.\u2019 \u201d Salahi saw no path out of Guant\u00e1namo. Even if the military believed he was innocent, he figured that he knew too much about classified torture programs to be let out into the world. By the time Wood left, he had come to accept his guards and interrogators as family. \u201cTrue, you didn\u2019t choose this family, nor did you grow up with it, but it\u2019s a family all the same,\u201d he wrote in his diary. \u201cEvery time a good member of my present family leaves it feels as if a piece of my heart is being chopped off.\u201d He often turned to a verse by the Iraqi poet Ahmed Matar: I stood in my cell", "Wondering about my situation", "Am I the prisoner, or is it that guard standing nearby?", "Between me and him stood a wall", "In the wall, there was a hole", "Through which I see light, and he sees darkness", "Just like me he has a wife, kids, a house", "Just like me he came here on orders from above. Having accepted his guards, Salahi wrote, the next phase of captivity was \u201cgetting used to the prison, and being afraid of the outside world.\u201d The Outside World", "A year in Echo Special shattered Wood\u2019s ideas about his post-military future. Before his deployment, he had aspired to become a police officer. \u201cBut I changed my mind after Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d he told me. He wanted no part of a system in which he might have control over another person\u2019s liberty. \u201cI don\u2019t like power,\u201d he said. He left the Oregon National Guard, and started working night shifts at a twenty-four-hour gym near Portland. Few people worked out at two or three in the morning, so he had plenty of time to continue his self-education on global affairs. He started in on the books he had been too afraid to request in Guant\u00e1namo\u2014ones about Islam. Wood had come to see Islam in much the same way that many of the detainees did: as the only thing that couldn\u2019t be stripped from them. The devotion, the routine of the five daily prayers\u2014\u201cthat kept Mohamedou going,\u201d Wood told me. Now, as he read, \u201cI saw how beautiful the religion was,\u201d he said. On most days, he searched Salahi\u2019s name online, hoping to learn more about the case, and to make sense of his own deployment to Echo Special, to no avail. He found it almost impossible to reconcile the news coverage of Guant\u00e1namo Bay with what he had witnessed there. As he read about Islamic history, he began to seek clarity in the Quran itself. In 2006, Wood removed his shoes at the entrance to the Masjid As-Saber, Portland\u2019s largest mosque. He wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted out of the visit\u2014he knew only that curiosity eclipsed his misgivings. During the next few months, Wood showed up between prayer times, to avoid any pressure to participate. On his third visit, he told two Saudi students that he wanted to become a Muslim. Conversion to Islam requires only that, in the presence of Muslim witnesses, you declare the Shahada\u2014\u201cThere is no God but God, and Muhammad is his prophet\u201d\u2014and that you believe it in your heart. The students acted as Wood\u2019s witnesses. Wood started sporadically attending prayers. An elderly white convert warned him to avoid a couple of other white converts, who dressed in religious clothing and talked about wanting to participate in the jihad. When Wood told the old man that he had worked at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the man suggested that he keep it to himself. Soon afterward, Wood learned that the imam, a Somali immigrant who practiced a conservative strain of Islam known as Salafism, had been the subject of F.B.I. investigations and was on a no-fly list, and that several men who had attended the Masjid As-Saber had been convicted on terrorism charges. \u201cSo that scared me away,\u201d he said. He stopped praying in public. \u201cI just wanted this to be me and God.\u201d By now, Wood was no longer dating Summer\u2019s mother. In 2008, he met a woman named Wendy at a bar. They married in 2010, and had a child six years later. He never told Wendy about his conversion.", "The United States leases the land beneath the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention facility from Cuba, for four thousand and eighty-five dollars a year, under an agreement signed after the Spanish-American War. (For the past sixty years, the Cuban government has sought to nullify the agreement, and it refuses to cash the checks.) Because detainees are not in U.S. territory, the government has not allowed them to be tried in U.S. courts. Instead, they are tried by secret military commissions\u2014if they are tried at all. More detainees have died at Guant\u00e1namo than have been convicted of a crime. The prosecutor assigned to Salahi\u2019s case was a lieutenant colonel named Stuart Couch, who had retired from the military before 9/11. A close friend of his had been the co-pilot of one of the planes that was flown into the World Trade Center, and Couch told the Wall Street Journal that he had re\u00ebnlisted because he wanted \u201cto get a crack at the guys who attacked the United States.\u201d When he saw the government\u2019s file on Salahi, he considered pursuing the death penalty. Couch never met Salahi, but, while Zuley was torturing him, Couch received summaries of each new confession. In late 2003\u2014a period that Salahi described in a letter as \u201cwhere my brake broke loose\u201d\u2014Couch struggled to keep up with the constant stream of information. In time, he became suspicious that Salahi\u2019s confessions had been elicited through torture, and were therefore tainted evidence. When he discovered the forged letter from Zuley\u2019s team, saying that the United States had captured Salahi\u2019s mother, he resigned from the case. In June, 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that Guant\u00e1namo detainees could challenge the grounds for their detention. It became fashionable for high-profile corporate-law firms to represent Guant\u00e1namo clients, pro bono, but many detainees rejected representation, because they thought it was a ploy to lend legitimacy to an unjust detention. Defense attorneys have accused the government of denying them access to evidence, leaving secret recording equipment in client meeting rooms, and infiltrating their legal teams; a few years ago, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who may face the death penalty, recognized a linguist on his own defense team from a C.I.A. black site. When Salahi\u2019s lawyers wrote to him, asking that he inform them of everything he had told the government, he wrote back, \u201cAre you out of your mind! How can I render uninterrupted interrogation that has been lasting the last 7 years. That\u2019s like asking Charlie Sheen how many women he dated.\u201d The important stuff was in his diary, he said, which they could read only inside a secure facility near Washington, D.C. In the military hearing, Salahi described the torture program in vivid detail. The transcript omits much of his testimony, noting that, at the moment he started to describe the abuse, \u201cthe recording equipment began to malfunction\u201d and that the tapes were \u201cdistorted.\u201d The transcript continues, \u201cThe Detainee wanted to show the Board his scars and location of injuries, but the board declined the viewing.\u201d (By now, the U.S. government was rolling back authorizations for torture techniques, and the military and the C.I.A. were entering a period of self-reflection; during the next several years, internal and congressional investigations would expose many of the worst abuses that had been inflicted on Salahi and other men in custody.) The government no longer attempted to prosecute Salahi\u2014nobody had touched the criminal case since Couch withdrew\u2014but it argued that he should nevertheless be detained indefinitely. On March 22, 2010, a U.S. district-court judge named James Robertson ruled on Salahi\u2019s petition to be released. \u201cThe government\u2019s case, essentially, is that Salahi was so connected to al-Qaida for a decade beginning in 1990 that he must have been \u2018part of\u2019 al-Qaida at the time of his capture,\u201d Robertson wrote. But the government had \u201cabandoned the theory\u201d that Salahi knew about 9/11 before it happened. As for his jihadi connections, Robertson continued, the government\u2019s classified filings \u201ctend to support Salahi\u2019s submission that he was attempting to find the appropriate balance\u2014avoiding close relationships with al-Qaida members, but also trying to avoid making himself an enemy\u201d of the group. In Robertson\u2019s assessment, the government\u2019s evidence about Salahi was \u201cso attenuated, or so tainted by coercion and mistreatment, or so classified, that it cannot support a successful criminal prosecution.\u201d He concluded, \u201cSalahi must be released from custody.\u201d Steve Wood was elated when he heard the news. But the government appealed, and Salahi stayed in Guant\u00e1namo. Wood contacted one of Salahi\u2019s lawyers, using a made-up name and a new e-mail address, to inquire about Salahi\u2019s well-being and the status of his case. But he subsequently forgot the log-in information, and so he never saw a reply. A couple of years later, he considered visiting Mauritania, to track down Salahi\u2019s family and apologize for his role in Salahi\u2019s detention. He no longer derived much solace from Islam, and rarely prayed. The decision to keep his conversion a secret from everyone in his life made him feel at times as if being Muslim were wrong, even though, in his heart, he still believed. In 2012, Salahi\u2019s lawyers won a seven-year legal battle to declassify his diary. Government censors redacted names, dates, locations, and other sensitive or embarrassing information. When they finished, Salahi\u2019s lawyers delivered a CD-rom with the scanned pages to Larry Siems, a writer and a human-rights advocate, who has written extensively on government misconduct in the aftermath of 9/11. \u201cThere was a really profound sense of responsibility and ethical risk which came with editing the manuscript of someone who was alive but unable to participate in that process,\u201d Siems told me. \u201cI petitioned the Defense Department to allow me to show him the edited manuscript, but they turned me down.\u201d In 2015, it was published, by Little, Brown, as \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Diary.\u201d Soon afterward, in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Salahi saw his own face on a TV screen. Siems was doing an interview about the diary, and in that moment Salahi finally felt as if he was beginning to take back the narrative of his life. \u201cMy cell expanded, the lights became brighter, colors more colorful, the sun shone warmer and gentler, and everyone around me looked friendlier,\u201d he wrote. Another year passed. Every time there was a hurricane warning in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Salahi dreamed that the storm had wiped away the prison camp, and everyone, detainees and captors alike, was \u201cfighting side by side to survive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn some versions I saved many lives, in others I was saved, but somehow we all managed to escape, unharmed and free.\u201d Wood reconnected with Salahi\u2019s lawyers, this time using his real name. When he learned that a military review board would consider releasing Salahi, he wrote a letter saying that, \u201cbased on my interactions with Mr. Slahi in Guant\u00e1namo, I would be pleased to welcome him into my home,\u201d and offering to testify in person. He also contacted another guard from Echo Special. According to Wood, the guard drafted a note, but he decided not to submit it. \u201cAll his friends and family knew him as the guy who was guarding a high-value detainee, and really proud of it,\u201d Wood told me. \u201cHis whole reputation rested on this fiction. But, after the diary came out, they learned that Mohamedou is not high value, he\u2019s just a guy who got fucked over for years.\u201d He added, \u201cGuant\u00e1namo has a long shadow for everyone\u2014not just the detainees.\u201d", "One night in October, 2016, Wood\u2019s phone rang while he was in a Safeway in Portland. On the other end of the line was a man whose voice he hadn\u2019t heard in more than eleven years. Salahi told him that he was now home. So much had changed since he had been taken into custody, more than fifty-four hundred days earlier. His mother was dead, and so was one of his brothers, but there were teen-age nieces and nephews whom he was meeting for the first time. The proceeds from his book were paying for a niece\u2019s studies in Dubai and a nephew\u2019s master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics at a university in Kuala Lumpur. Salahi told Wood that he had written four more books in detention, but he hadn\u2019t been allowed to take them out of Guant\u00e1namo. One was a self-help book about finding happiness in a hopeless place. Wood told Salahi that he was working for his brother\u2019s construction company, repairing bridges. The hours were unpredictable, with long drives and arduous shifts. As at Guant\u00e1namo, he often worked at night. But he derived immense satisfaction from the work, and saw in it the kind of moral clarity that Guant\u00e1namo had lacked. When I visited Wood, last August, he and his team were layering the surface of a bridge near Dayton, Oregon, with epoxy, rocks, and primer. \u201cThe point is to pave, seal, and waterproof it, to preserve its lifespan,\u201d he said. We got to the site at sunrise; the sky was a hazy, muted orange, from wildfires burning to the south. \u201cIt takes a lot of prep to start the job, but, when you\u2019ve done your bit, you\u2019re leaving things better than when you arrived,\u201d he said. Salahi\u2019s freedom became a strain on Wood\u2019s marriage. Wood became secretive about his calls with Salahi; Wendy began to suspect that he was having an affair. When Wood agreed to talk about Salahi for a TV documentary, Wendy\u2019s parents staged an intervention. \u201cThey said I was bringing shame upon the family, and protecting a terrorist,\u201d Wood recalled. When he refused to back out of the interview, Wendy insisted that he wear an on-camera disguise. She told me that she thought he was doing something really dangerous\u2014that people might think"]}
