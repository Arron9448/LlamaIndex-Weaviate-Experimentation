I was the leader of the expedition and he was part of the team. He never made the summit and even had frostbite. He along with Seema Rani Goswami had to be rescued by the Sherpas.\u201d", "The claimed Everest ascent is one of several by Indian teams that have recently prompted scepticism. In 2019 three other Indian climbers were accused in Outside magazine of claiming to have climbed the mountain without getting higher than camp 3, a significant way from the summit.", "The Times of India quoted a source at the Indian sports ministry suggesting they agreed with the Nepali ban after an investigation that also involved the Indian Mountaineering Federation.", "\u201cThe Narender Singh Yadav issue is over from our side. The inquiry initiated by the ministry found he faked climbing Everest. He submitted fake pictures,\u201d the source said.", "Everest ascents are usually verified by a liaison officer from the Nepalese ministry of tourism, with climbers required to produce a photograph of themselves standing on the summit with a clear view of their face before they are issued with a summit certificate.", "As well as banning the Indian climbers, who had waited until they returned to India to announce their claimed ascent rather than doing so in Nepal, Nepal also fined Seven Summit Treks, which organised the expedition. Yadav\u2019s Sherpa guide Dawa Sherpa has been fined 10,000 Nepali rupees (\u00a360). They had all attested to Yadav\u2019s claims. Yadav and Rani had been members of a 14-strong commercial expedition.", "Mingma Sherpa, of Seven Summit Treks, said it issued the certificate because the climbers\u2019 claim was supported by the accompanying Sherpa guide.", "\u201cIf the climbers do a fake climb, how will the trekking company get to know? Our task is to assist in getting the permit, organise the trek and route. The two Indian climbers showed us the pictures of their summit and we wrote that they had climbed. The Nepal ministry of tourism decides about the certificates,\u201d Mingma Sherpa told the Indian Express.", "The banned climbers would not be the first to have claimed summits they had not completed. While sometimes it is a question of stopping at a nearby peak, as is often the case in claimed ascents of Nepal\u2019s Mount Manaslu \u2013 which are more widely accepted \u2013 in other cases the controversy is greater.", "In 1906, Frederick Cook, later to be convicted of fraud for his business dealings, falsely claimed to have made the first ascent of North America\u2019s highest mountain, Denali in Alaska, posing for a summit picture on a rocky outcrop.", "Perhaps the greatest climbing controversy centred on the claims by Cesare Maestri \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s greatest Alpinists, who died aged 91 last month \u2013 to have climbed Cerro Torre in Patagonia in 1959, fuelling a decades-long controversy."], "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "keywords": ["everest", "accused", "claimed", "bans", "yadav", "ascent", "ministry", "indian", "sherpa", "climbers", "faking", "nepal", "mountaineering", "summit"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
