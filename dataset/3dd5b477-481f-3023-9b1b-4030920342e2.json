We\u2019ve just had four years of negotiation. We\u2019ve arrived at a treaty and now we\u2019ve got to make that treaty work,\u201d he said.", "He said there were aspects of the treaty that might be improved on, including how it covered the creative industries and what it did for the service sector, which he said had largely been left out.", "When it was put to him that this would disappoint Labour members who voted for him because of his commitment to free movement, Starmer said it was not realistic to pretend that the EU would want to negotiate a new Brexit treaty with the UK.", "\u201cWhether we like it or not, that is going to be the treaty that an incoming Labour government inherits and has to make work. And it is not being straight with the British public to say we can come into office in 2024 and operate some other treaty,\u201d he said.", "Free movement became an issue in the leadership campaign after the party conference backed the principle in autumn 2019. The commitment was linked to defending migrants\u2019 rights generally, but it contradicted previous party comments saying free movement would end if the UK left the EU.", "Asked by Marr if he thought government debt, at about 100% of GDP, was at a dangerous level, Starmer said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to reassess debt.\u201d He would not, however, say how until he knew the state of the economy at the time of the next election.", "He refused to commit to renewing Labour\u2019s 2019 pledge for free broadband in the next election manifesto, although he said more should be done to improve broadband access for disadvantaged pupils and their families.", "Starmer also said he did not favour another Scottish independence referendum now, but that he thought Boris Johnson was wrong to rule one out for another 40 years.", "He also said the status quo with regard to Scotland wasn\u2019t working, which is why he said Labour favoured a constitutional commission."], "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow"], "keywords": ["movement", "renegotiation", "accepts", "2019", "starmer", "brexit", "labour", "election", "eu", "end", "treaty", "reversal", "free", "uk", "weve"], "pubDate": "2021-01-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
