The surprise crossover adds a new curse, weapons, and challenge room inspired by Dead Cells and, best of all, will be free of charge to players.", "The update is appropriately titled Curse of the Dead Cells and arrives on April 14. Players will have to contend with Curse of the Headless, a new curse that tips the hat toward Dead Cells\u2019 noggin-less protagonist that grants faster movement at the expense of taking more damage. Another new curse is coming as well, but developer Passtech Games is keeping tight-lipped on what that one entails.", "You can also get their hands on three Dead Cells flavored weapons: Sword of Conjunctivitis, Broadsword of the Knight, and the Crossbow of the Condemned. Additionally, a new two-handed weapon style is coming as well.", "A new challenge room will house one of Dead Cells\u2019 cursed chests. In Dead Cells, these chests grant a powerful reward at the expense of being saddled with a curse that usually fades when players kill a certain number of enemies. It\u2019s unclear if that\u2019ll remain true here, but you\u2019ll need to win whatever challenge it hits you with to earn rare weapons, including a cursed one.", "Curse of the Dead Gods already shares some similarities to Dead Cells, making this crossover a logical and, most of all, cool idea. The update is coming to all versions of the game, which means PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.", "For more on Curse of the Dead Gods, check out our review of the game here.
