There was a commitment by 65 countries and the European Union to reach net-zero carbon emissions\u2014taking as much carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as they are putting in\u2014by 2050. Germany, Slovakia and others joined an alliance to halt the construction of coal plants; 32 countries are now members. Companies and investors announced measures to reduce emissions from shipping, buildings and more. Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, set a new 450-gigawatt target for his country\u2019s renewable-energy capacity, more than five times the current level. The UN \u2019s secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, professed himself pleased: \u201cToday, in this hall, the world saw clear ambition and concrete initiatives.\u201d", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Some announcements were promises of future announcements. Fully 59 countries said that they would shortly be unveiling more ambitious commitments under the Paris agreement, which aims to keep global temperatures \u201cwell below\u201d 2\u00b0C above those in pre-industrial times; a global round of such increased commitments is to be negotiated next year.", "Even if all the pledges are acted on, though, the gap between what the summit promised and what needs to be done remains a chasm. If Mr Modi were to quintuple India\u2019s renewable power capacity over 11 years, that would represent an annual growth no higher than that of renewable generation worldwide in the decade 2007-17\u2014and he said nothing about reining in the support that India\u2019s state-owned banks offer coal companies. India has made no commitment to reach net-zero by 2050 or at any other time\u2014any more than America, China or Russia has.", "Away from the UN , businesses got in on the act. Some 87 companies, including Nestl\u00e9 and Salesforce, a big provider of software-as-a-service, pledged to reach net-zero emissions in their businesses by 2050. Jeff Bezos did them ten years better, announcing that Amazon would reach net-zero emissions by 2040 and that it was buying 100,000 electric lorries to move towards that goal. Overall, some 650 companies with a market value of $11trn have signed up to the Science-Based Targets Initiative, a consortium of NGO s which certify and monitor the commitments firms make to align themselves with the Paris objectives. Many aim to cut emissions by around 2.5% a year. They are trying to reduce energy consumption in their supply chains and in the way their products are used, too. On average these emissions are almost six times larger than those from a firm\u2019s direct operations, says Alberto Carrillo Pineda of CDP , an NGO which monitors corporate climate efforts.", "Unfortunately, while target-setting firms account for 14% of the world\u2019s stockmarket value, they emit only 2% of its carbon. Between 1988 and 2015, according to CDP , 71% of greenhouse-gas emissions came from fossil fuels sold by 100 energy giants. On the afternoon of September 23rd the bosses of companies including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP sat in the airy Morgan Library for a forum organised by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry effort to reduce emissions from operations and invest in technologies that will help mitigate climate change.", "The firms vowed to limit methane emissions and highlighted their investment into carbon capture and sequestration. But they also explained that they were continuing to develop new oil and gas fields. \u201cWe are meeting a demand for a product that makes the quality of life in the world better,\u201d said Mike Wirth, the boss of Chevron.", "They are unlikely to stop unless demand drops off. That might happen if, or when, the regulatory war on carbon enters a new phase. A new report by Principles for Responsible Investment, an unsupported group of investors with $86trn under management, predicts \u201cabrupt and disruptive\u201d climate policies by 2025, as authorities wake up to the urgency of the climate challenge. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, used his UN speech to stress the need for businesses to be made to disclose the costs that climate change and climate policies could stick them with.", "A complement to better assessing the climate risks of investment is to invest in things that reduce the climate risk in the first place. This is aim of the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative ( CFLI ), a group of banks, asset managers and energy developers handpicked by Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and a UN special envoy for climate change.", "There is a huge need for energy investment in poor countries. There is a huge amount of capital in rich-world pension funds. At the moment, though, zero-carbon energy in developing countries does not appeal to those funds\u2019 appetite for safe and reliable investments.", "That is where the CFLI comes in. By bringing together asset managers, like AXA and Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund, banks, like HSBC , and energy-project developers, such as Enel, it can cover the pipeline of renewable investment projects\u2014from capital raising and allocation to project development.", "In a recent report the CFLI said that closer ties between private finance and development-finance institutions would allow greater use of tools that share risk between public and private investors. With that in mind, on September 25th the CFLI announced a tie-up with the Association of European Development Finance Institutions. The association\u2019s members have experience in emerging markets; they can scope out projects for the CFLI and bear some of the risks.", "The CFLI plans to invest $20bn in the next five years. Compared with the trillions needed in clean energy, that does not sound much. But Daniel Klier of HSBC argues that by creating successful pilot projects the CFLI can demonstrate the attraction of its strategies for removing risk from renewable energy investments."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2019/09/26/the-world-is-still-struggling-to-implement-meaningful-climate-policy", "title": "The world is still struggling to implement meaningful climate policy", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["world", "countries", "renewable", "cfli", "struggling", "energy", "companies", "carbon", "investment", "meaningful", "climate", "policy", "emissions", "implement", "reduce"]}
