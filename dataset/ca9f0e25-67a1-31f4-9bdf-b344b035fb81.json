In the summer, the spot is crawling with surfers. But, with the sky still purple and the temperature around thirty-eight degrees, Grosvenor and one other middle-aged guy were the only ones who had shown up to paddle out. Still built like an athlete at fifty, Grosvenor hopped out of the board-laden truck, climbed into its bed, and taped a hand-scrawled sign to the rear window:", "WINTER SOLSTICE", "SURFATHON", "7:07 \u2013 4:26?", "STOKED", "Grosvenor is an artist who makes experimental films and sculptures with aerodynamic lines, but his primary mode of expression involves riding waves and otherwise pursuing locomotion in the waters off eastern Long Island. His recent projects\u2014or, as he calls them, \u201cwater incidents\u201d\u2014include a gale-chasing expedition on a standup paddleboard and a swimming-and-camping trip, which involved towing a raft full of gear, attached by a leash to his waist, through the Atlantic. For the solstice, Grosvenor planned to surf continuously from sunrise to sunset, to raise money for the Montauk Food Pantry. \u201cI love this time of the year,\u201d he said, pulling a wetsuit over a merino onesie and wool socks. \u201cI don\u2019t find the dark gloomy. To me, it\u2019s beautiful and mysterious. And the solstice is a moment of transition, which I hope is also happening in the country.\u201d", "Grosvenor exudes boyish, buoyant good nature, but he can get quasi-mystical when he describes \u201chaving faith in the sea as a sanctuary.\u201d Known for his ability to ride waves on pretty much anything, from standard surfboards to a nylon mat, he had chosen, for the solstice, a twelve-foot foam board, on the bottom of which he had written \u201cFOOD.\u201d He had also brought along an old red canoe, which he loaded with jugs of water, trail mix, a thermos of miso soup, and tinned sardines, and anchored just beyond the breakers. \u201cSo I can eat like a seagull,\u201d he said.", "A few minutes before seven, he paddled out past the breaking waves, and then, sitting on his heels, glided into the surf, quickly catching a gentle left peeler and popping to his feet for a long, easy ride. By then, he had been joined by five or six other surfers; a rotating group of about twenty-five would come and go throughout the day. From time to time, one of them would paddle over to chat, but Grosvenor mostly kept his own counsel, leisurely catching one wave after another and riding each with a silent economy of motion that contrasted with some of the hotdoggery going on around him. In between waves, he drifted, face down, one cheek resting on the board, or on his back, or sitting upright, windmilling his arms and kicking his legs to keep warm.", "In the parking lot, wetsuited men and women stopped to read the sign on Grosvenor\u2019s truck. A little before noon, an East Hampton Marine Patrol truck rolled up and parked next to Stu Foley, the owner of a local surf shop, who had just got out of the water. Someone had called to report an empty canoe floating offshore.", "Soon, Grosvenor\u2019s big-haired, twenty-five-year-old son, Mamoun, arrived, an audiobook of Zadie Smith\u2019s \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d blaring from his car\u2019s speakers. He had brought some doughnuts for his father, one of which he took along as he paddled out to join him. Grosvenor\u2019s wife, Saskia Friedrich, an artist, showed up in painted jeans, a puffer coat, and a purple beanie, with their Australian shepherds, Vishnu and Blinky. She recalled how, when Grosvenor took her ocean kayaking years ago, they noticed a large shadow pass under their boat, and it turned out to be a twenty-foot-long white shark. \u201cJeremy\u2019s got this almost yogic thing, allowing him to enjoy activities that would require us to overcome our natural discomfort or terror,\u201d she said.", "Later, as the sun seemed to be giving up the ghost, Grosvenor told a floating correspondent that the day had been mostly easy and pleasant. Despite all the hours in the elements, things had never become hallucinatory, although he had been moved to tears once, he said, by the merging awareness of the beauty around him and the suffering of the world. He had managed to keep warm, except in three of his toes, through physical motion and deep breathing, he said, \u201clike a stellar sea cow.\u201d", "As dusk fell, a handful of spectators greeted Grosvenor\u2019s landfall with cheers. Mamoun, wearing a \u201cFree Palestine\u201d hoodie, threw his arms around his father and, handing him the last of the doughnuts, said, \u201cAll right! Free doughnut! Black lives matter!\u201d", "Grosvenor said that his day in the ocean had been a test run for a plan to surf twenty-four hours straight on the summer solstice. \u201cSo many plans\u2014that\u2019s the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause then you don\u2019t get anything done.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Adam Green", "Adam Gree"], "keywords": ["waves", "day", "water", "montauk", "surfing", "white", "grosvenors", "solstice", "sunset", "took", "truck", "surf", "grosvenor"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
