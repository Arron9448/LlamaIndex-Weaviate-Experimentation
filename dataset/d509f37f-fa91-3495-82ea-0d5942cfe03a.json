When her postgraduate course started in September she dialled into lessons from her home in Shandong province; in January she came to Britain, even though she knew that would mean weathering a lockdown. Because her course only lasts a year she wants to be in a position to get out and about as soon as restrictions are loosened. She says she is not too worried about the virus, having bagged a vaccine in China before she flew out.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Last spring vice-chancellors warned that tens of thousands of international students would choose not to enrol because of the pandemic. The University and College Union forecast that the number starting new courses could fall by half. Because most international students pay vastly higher tuition fees than British ones, a slump risked poking huge holes in universities\u2019 finances. Citing the risk of bankruptcies, Universities UK ( UUK ), a lobby group, tried and failed to convince the government to offer the sector a bail-out worth about \u00a32bn ($2.75bn).", "The data available so far suggests that things are turning out better than foreseen. In December UCAS , a body that processes university applications, reported that the number of foreigners given places on undergraduate courses last autumn had risen by nearly 11% compared with the previous year (see chart). There is less information about postgraduates, who make up more than half of foreign students and who are thought to be more likely to have put their study plans on hold. Vivienne Stern of UUK thinks it is possible that when all the sums are done the total number of enrolled foreigners could be similar to the number recorded before covid-19 hit. Some universities will still see shortfalls, and because many foreign students are studying remotely they are spending less than normal on accommodation and other living costs. But given the grisly expectations, says Ms Stern, recruitment has gone \u201cridiculously\u201d well."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["remarkably", "remain", "britains", "students", "stern", "international", "university", "number", "uuk", "foreigners", "universities", "foreign", "studying", "keen", "study"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
