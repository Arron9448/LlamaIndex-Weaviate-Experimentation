In contrast to many of the other NFTs on the market, hers are steeped in reality, offering video of small, personal moments like sleeping, walking, and driving. \u201cArt for me has always been about the moment. Time is the thing that there is never enough of and that waits for no one; I\u2019m intrigued by who will want to own a moment of mine,\u201d Moss wrote via email. She noted that the sale of her three NFTs, on sale next Tuesday, will benefit Adwoa Aboah\u2019s Gurls Talk foundation, supporting mental health among women. \u201cI was also drawn to the idea that this ownership can be used to help others in need hopefully gain more of it. I look forward to seeing this experiment through,\u201d said Moss.", "The artist collective behind Moss\u2019s NFTs sees it similarly: an opportunity to experience a moment of (virtual) closeness with an icon. \u201cWe wanted the authentic, real her, an insight into KM\u2019s life and style,\u201d the anonymous collective known as Moments in Time Collective, which produced the pieces, said in an email.

The collective added: \u201cWe had to be more respectful as this is all about trust to really capture the real moment\u2014normally Kate models as a character, but this is truly Kate Moss. In terms of the NFT creation we focused on really giving people authenticity and uniqueness. That could stand the test of time and also capture a moment of it.\u201d"], "authors": ["Steff Yotka", "Steff Yotk"], "keywords": ["works", "moss", "gets", "moment", "sale", "mosss", "art", "really", "market", "real", "collective", "video", "nfts", "nft", "kate"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
