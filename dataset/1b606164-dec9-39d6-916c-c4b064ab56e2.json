And, as a new generation of voters comes of age, the specious talking point provides cover for politicians who can see that their party\u2019s prospects may be dimming.", "Although Republicans maintained their ironclad grip on Texas last year, Trump\u2019s margin of victory in the presidential race winnowed to less than six points, from a nine-point lead four years earlier. Democrats also gained significant ground during the 2018 midterm elections, when former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke lost his Senate bid to incumbent Ted Cruz by fewer than 215,000 votes.", "The state\u2019s current officeholders know they will not be able to get re-elected on the issues alone, so they are moving the goalpost, said Claudia Yoli Ferla, executive director of civic engagement non-profit Move Texas.", "\u201cThese legislators are seeing the writing on the wall, and they\u2019re scared of the power of young people. They\u2019re scared to have the true voices of our communities reflected,\u201d Yoli Ferla said.", "Already Texas subjects its residents to a byzantine electoral system, giving it a reputation as the hardest place to vote in the US. Voters do not have access to same-day registration, and they can only register online if they are simultaneously updating their driver\u2019s license.", "Then, at the ballot box, hardline documentation requirements honor handgun licenses as a form of accepted identification, but not student IDs. Mail-in voting is so limited that last fall, voters were forced to gather in long lines, in-person, regardless of the coronavirus pandemic.", "But despite Texas\u2019s legacy of voter suppression, large, Democratic counties \u2013 most notably Houston\u2019s Harris county \u2013 came up with innovative approaches to expand access to the polls last year. For instance, Harris county implemented 24-hour and drive-thru polling sites, while the local election administrator tried to send mail-in ballot applications to every registered voter.", "Instead of lauding those solutions, Republicans fought them hard. Now, the state\u2019s leaders are working to ensure they are not an option for future elections.", "\u201cWhether it\u2019s the unauthorized expansion of mail-in ballots, or the unauthorized expansion of drive-thru voting, we must pass laws to prevent election officials from jeopardizing the election process,\u201d said the Texas governor, Greg Abbott.", "In February, while Trump\u2019s national defeat was still fresh, Abbott designated so-called \u201celection integrity\u201d as one of five emergency items for the legislature. As of late last month, Texas was leading the charge among 47 total states that had introduced 361 bills restricting the vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.", "One Texas bill would do away with drive-through polling places, allow partisan poll watchers to electronically record voters, and set limits on early voting hours.", "Another could consolidate voter registration responsibilities under the secretary of state, sidelining local governments.", "Yet another would dangle felony charges over basic activities, such as public servants proactively distributing applications to vote by mail.", "Texas is already known for criminalizing the ballot box, especially among communities of color. Under the state\u2019s current attorney general, Ken Paxton, at least 72% of prosecutions by the so-called election integrity unit have targeted Black and Latino residents, according to the ACLU of Texas.", "Those severe penalties cause confusion and can have chilling effects on would-be voters. In the border community of Brownsville, people fear they can\u2019t legally vote for reasons that should not be disqualifying, such as their family\u2019s immigration status, said Ofelia Alonso, a regional field manager for youth organizers at Texas Rising Action.", "\u201cIt\u2019s already such a hostile environment for folks that want to participate in the process, but these restrictions would make it even harder,\u201d Alonso said.", "In an ironic turn, the proposed reforms may inadvertently affect senior citizens, who are among the few demographics eligible to vote by mail, and whose bloc trends right.", "As the Texas legislative session ramps up, voting rights advocates and experts are especially concerned by two omnibus bills filled with restrictions, SB7 and HB6. Both are already advancing through the legislature.", "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of difficult to be able to have a strategy on, like, how to target this,\u201d said Alonso, \u201cwhen we know that the majority of the Republicans in the Texas legislature are very shameless.\u201d", "Unlike in Georgia, where backlash from corporations such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines came retroactively, the Texas bills have already become a lightning rod.", "\u201cFree, fair, equitable access to voting is the foundation of American democracy,\u201d Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Technologies, tweeted in early April. \u201cThose rights \u2013 especially for women, communities of color \u2013 have been hard-earned.", "\u201cGovernments should ensure citizens have their voices heard. HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it.\u201d", "American Airlines similarly came out against SB7, saying the company is \u201cstrongly opposed to this bill and others like it\u201d.", "But, emboldened by victory in 2020, the state\u2019s conservatives don\u2019t seem to care. When corporate giants decried the bills for being anti-democratic, Abbott simply warned them to \u201cstay out of politics\u201d.", "\u201cTheir priority\u2019s to stay in power, with whatever means necessary,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cAnd election fraud is a good fearmongering way to rile up their base and not have to come out and say what they\u2019re doing are Jim Crow tactics.", "\u201cThey won\u2019t say it, but we know what it is.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Villarreal"], "keywords": ["voters", "alonso", "republicans", "lead", "texas", "voting", "clampdown", "shameless", "charge", "vote", "states", "bills", "voter", "election"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
