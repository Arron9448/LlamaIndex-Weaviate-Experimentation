A source familiar with discussions said Harris' team believed the cover would feature her posing in a light blue suit against a gold background.", "An apparently leaked copy of the publication's February issue cover, shot in front of a pink and green background, began circulating online Sunday. The photo instantly attracted ire on social media for appearing poorly lit and styled, while others suggested it was \" disrespectful \" to the Vice President-elect.", "With some Twitter users even questioning whether the image had been faked, Vogue confirmed it as genuine -- but added to the confusion by revealing a second \"digital\" cover showing Harris in a powder blue Michael Kors suit against a gold background. CNN's source said that Harris team had expected this outfit to be used as the main cover photo, with the more casual attire appearing inside the magazine. The same source said the Harris team has asked for a new cover, though the print version of the magazine went to press in mid-December.", "Vogue revealed a second \"digital\" cover featuring Harris in a blue suit.

Mitchell posted just one of the covers to Instagram -- the one of Harris in a blue suit. Mitchell did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.", "A 'washed out mess'", "Explaining the influences behind the cover shoot, Vogue said that the apple green and salmon pink background had been inspired by the colors of Howard University's Alpha Kappa Alpha, the \"first historically African American sorority.\" An accompanying article said that Mitchell had wanted to \"honor Harris's college days and the powerful women who comprise the ranks of sororities like Alpha Kappa Alpha.\"", "The article also said that the Vice President-elect's styling choices \"were her own,\" and that the image \"reflects Harris at her casual best.\"", "The cover of Vogue's February 2021 issue.

Playwright and lawyer Wajahat Ali described it as a \"mess up,\" adding that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour \"must really not have Black friends and colleagues.\"", "Not everyone was so dismissive of the casually styled shot. \"Folks are arguing over the photo chosen for VP Harris's Vogue cover, but here's what's important: she looks great, she's being honored, and the cover is driving Trump and Melania nuts,\" tweeted novelist Paul Rudnick, an apparent reference to the outgoing president's complaint that his wife is yet to appear on the cover of a major fashion magazine as first lady.", "Meanwhile, Washington Post's senior critic-at-large Robin Givhan, wrote that while \"there's nothing inherently wrong with this picture,\" in selecting the more informal one as its cover, \"Vogue robbed Harris of her roses.\"", "\"A bit of awe would have served the magazine well in its cover decisions.
