Since the publication of her first book, \u201cMating in Captivity,\u201d in 2006, she has travelled the world, speaking to audiences about love, sex, intimacy, and infidelity: the nuts and bolts of romantic life. (Those who do not have an opportunity to see her live can watch her on the TED stage, where her videos, subtitled in more than thirty languages, have been viewed tens of millions of times.) Perel, who grew up in Antwerp as the daughter of Holocaust survivors, got her start as a family therapist, focussing on issues of trauma and cultural conflict. Couples have since become her clinical and theoretical specialty. In a style marked by humor, frankness, and empathy, Perel\u2019s talks and books take a counterintuitive approach to answering provocative questions: How did the romantic couple become the primary unit of organization in society? Can romantic desire truly be sustained? Is infidelity ever a good thing?", "Last year, Perel gave her fans access to a different side of her work. In her Audible podcast, \u201cWhere Should We Begin?\u201d\u2014which recently aired its third season\u2014Perel conducts therapy sessions with real couples, one per episode, allowing listeners unprecedented access to her cloistered consultation room. The appeal of the show is partly voyeuristic; it is fascinating, not to mention unnerving, to hear other people expose their most intimate feelings and conflicts. It is also educational, poignant, and often profound, a public service in a culture that loves to talk about love, but rarely does so with honesty or humility. I first spoke with Perel last year, and caught up with her this fall onstage at the New Yorker Festival, where we discussed her own family background, her theories about romantic life, and her role as a mediator between a couple\u2019s competing narratives. When we listened to clips from her show, Perel handed out pillowy eye masks so that audience members could focus more fully on her patients\u2019 voices; as you listen to the audio clips amid the text below, you might want to do the same by closing your eyes.", "This interview has been edited and condensed.", "My first question has to do with your idea that the couple has never before been such a central unit in our social organization. Why is that the case?", "Because never in the history of family life was the emotional well-being of the couple relevant to the survival of the family. The couple could be miserable for thirty years, you were stuck for life, you married once\u2014and, if you didn\u2019t like it, you could hope for an early death of your partner. Marriage was a pragmatic institution. You need to have it, but, once you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s not a great thing, and certainly not for the women.", "And then we added romantic needs to the pairing, the need for belonging and for companionship. We have gone up the Maslow ladder of needs, and now we are bringing our need for self-actualization to the marriage. We keep wanting more. We are asking from one person what once an entire village used to provide.", "Do you think people are aware of any of this when they go looking for a partner? We\u2019re looking for \u201cthe one,\u201d even if we\u2019re a little bit cynical about that idea\u2014", "No, we\u2019re not cynical at all.", "O.K.", "Marriage is an aggregate of multiple narratives. It belongs to the people who are in it, but it also belongs to the people who are supporting it and living around it: family, friends, community. As I once said, and it became a kind of a saying for me, when you pick a partner, you pick a story, and then you find yourself in a play you never auditioned for. And that is when the narratives clash.", "The first thing you can ask yourself, from a cross-cultural point of view, is, Is marriage between two people, in your mind? Or do you come from, or still live in, a culture in which marriage is between two families? That will inform everything about the boundaries around a relationship.", "You\u2019ve practiced therapy for over thirty years. In that time\u2014in the United States, certainly, and in large parts of the world\u2014relationships have changed significantly. We have gay marriage. Women are having children later than ever before. Technology has become a huge factor in how we look for partners, and then in how we maintain contact with them. What are some themes around relationships that you see at the moment?", "We come from a model where relationships, in our village lives, in our communal structures, were very clear. The community gave you your sense of identity. You knew who you were. You knew what was expected of you, and you knew how to behave. You had a lot of certainty, a lot of belonging, zero freedom.", "And we have urbanized, and we have moved, and we have taken on radical individualism and aspirational materialism, and all of those things have created a playing field in which relationships are undergoing rapid changes. We have no idea how to handle them. Rules have been replaced by choices. But at the same time we have massive uncertainty and massive self-doubt. Every second book about relationships these days is about belonging and loneliness.", "So I think that\u2019s the big thing that is changing: what used to be defined by rules and duty and obligation now has to take place in conversation. And so everything is a freakin\u2019 negotiation! You negotiate with your partner about what matters, where you want to live, if you want to have children, how many children do you want to have, if this is the right time to have children. It\u2019s an absolute existential smorgasbord. But at the same time it\u2019s very difficult to have to define everything ourselves. We are not just in pain for no reason, is what I\u2019m trying to say.", "So our expectations are really high. Our performance is somewhat lower.", "Right. Good summary.", "I want to ask you about apology, which is something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot lately, especially around #MeToo. How can we expect people who have done real wrong to others, in relationships, or in public, or at work, or wherever, to apologize? Something in our society seems to not allow it. The potential admission is too great.", "Admission and apology are not the same. There are two justice systems, right? There\u2019s the restitutive system and the retributive system. One is focussed on healing. One is focussed on punishment and vengeance.", "The South Africans created a system for accountability: you don\u2019t apologize; you stand accountable. You describe the facts and you leave the other person the freedom to decide what they want to do with it. If they want to forgive, because it\u2019s in their interest to forgive\u2014not to forgive as in saying it was O.K., but just not to live being eaten up with the hatred, with the hurt\u2014that\u2019s their freedom. You own your wrongdoing. That\u2019s one piece of the apology.", "In terms of healing, what we do know is that pain is universal, but the meaning that we give to our pain, and the way we narrate our pain, is highly cultural and contextual. And there is nothing that helps us deal better with those experiences than our connections with others. Social connection is the No. 1 salve for most of the pain, and the hurt, and the trauma that we will experience. And communities that come together naturally will provide that kind of buffer.", "What makes the trauma worse is not the event itself. It\u2019s the isolation, the secrecy, and the shame that you have to then live with afterward. I know it professionally, but I also know it through my own personal life. I mean, I grew up in that experience. I watched it every day.", "You grew up in Belgium, as the daughter of Holocaust survivors.", "All Belgian Jews were deported, sixty thousand of them. A few thousand kids got saved by being hidden. After the war, the entire Jewish community of Belgium\u2014which at this point amounts to about forty thousand people out of eleven million Belgians\u2014were people who came from the camps, from the woods, from hiding places. The entire community was a community of survivors. That\u2019s all we knew. And the community of survivors, worldwide, without any input from psychiatrists or psychologists, had gatherings\u2014gatherings for the survivors of camp such-and-such, gatherings for the survivors of village such-and-such, parties, planting of forests, creating life, having children.", "And that coming together, why is it interesting? Because it\u2019s the first time people understood that there was such a thing as an adult trauma. Before then, Freudian thinking said it\u2019s all between zero and five. So now we had a notion that you could have been perfectly fine before, but a cataclysmic event like this can destroy you, and the only way you can remember a sense of continuity, a sense of purpose, a sense of connection is by gathering with others. And that\u2019s what I watched.", "Your parents each were the only survivors in their respective families. What was that like as a child, growing up in that kind of family? What was their marriage like?", "For a lot of people who married after World War II, it was \u201cI\u2019m alone, you\u2019re alone, I\u2019ve lost everything, you\u2019ve lost everything, let\u2019s get married.\u201d That really was the way a lot of people mated. And many of them, once they had begun to reconstruct life, didn\u2019t really have much in common. I happened to be quite lucky. My parents met the day of liberation, on the road. But she was more educated; he was rather illiterate. So he adored her for life. And it was actually a very nice thing to watch.", "But I think the more interesting distinction between my family and other families\u2014and you can extend this to all trauma\u2014is that after this kind of experience, sometimes there are people who are not dead, and sometimes there are people who are alive. Some people survive, and some people thrive again. There were homes that were morbid\u2014you just couldn\u2019t enjoy, because, if you enjoy, if you experience pleasure, it means you\u2019re not vigilant, it means you\u2019re not on guard, it means you\u2019re not watching for the next danger.", "And then there were the other people who really kind of decided to take life as a vengeance, and to live it at every moment. And I am very lucky in that sense, that I was in a household that veered to that extreme. You couldn\u2019t be sad for two minutes, or somebody would say, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d You never could have a problem that was worthy enough of being sad, because who can compete with Auschwitz? So, you know, it\u2019s not like this is such a piece of cake, either.", "You went to study in Israel, and then in the U.S. And when you got to the U.S., you met the man who became your husband.", "Yes.", "So you became an American\u2014or started the process of becoming an American\u2014rather unexpectedly.", "I thought I would be in New York one year, and I never used my return ticket.", "And when did you start working with couples? Why was that a focus?", "I was interested in issues of immigration and identity very early on. I studied cultural relations and religious identity, the formation of identity. How does it change in terms of voluntary migration or forced migration? And, particularly, with an interest in looking at Jewish identity and how it evolves differently depending on the national context. What is the difference between Jews in America, in Australia, in South Africa, in Germany and Argentina, in Israel? So I got into studying how relationships shift with big cultural changes. I spent twenty years, before any writing about sexuality, working on culturally, racially, and religiously mixed families and couples, here and abroad.", "My book \u201cMating in Captivity\u201d was a complete accident. I had no idea I would ever write about any of the subjects that I\u2019ve been talking about for the last few years. And couple\u2019s therapy came out of family therapy, because in the past people came to therapy because a child had problems. That was the legitimate reason for which you could come as a family. Often, the child was the symptom-bearer of issues that were actually located in the relationship. And, gradually, you would try to bring the people to come. Couples therapy is the most difficult. It\u2019s often the most useless. But it\u2019s the best theatre in town. I find it captivating.", "Well, so do we! You have a podcast called \u201cWhere Should We Begin?,\u201d in which you do a session of couple\u2019s therapy with a couple that\u2019s never come to you before. We hear a couple being totally honest with each other\u2014or not honest, in a lot of cases\u2014totally raw, either way, in this very, very intimate setting. So the idea to do this show, I think, is insane! How did you decide to do it?", "I was the consultant on the Showtime series \u201cThe Affair,\u201d on the first two seasons. And June Cohen, from TED, came to a conversation with Audible and with Jesse Baker, who is my executive co-producer. They wanted a kind of a podcast that would be \u201che said, she said.\u201d And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not at all the way a couple works, actually. It\u2019s what I say that makes you say the opposite of what you actually originally intended to say, that then makes me say the thing that I\u2019m going to regret afterwards, or that I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for all of God knows how long.\u201d It\u2019s much more circular.", "And I said, \u201cIf you want, you should come and listen in on a session, and see if you think there is material.\u201d And it has become, without my thinking of it, almost like a public-health campaign for relationships. You don\u2019t feel it as much because you\u2019re saturated with content here, but in countries where there is nothing, it\u2019s an incredible thing for people who are coming out of situations where there are no narratives that they can embrace for how they want to live their relational life. And that\u2019s when you start to really see the impact of such a thing that a book could never, ever do.", "I actually think it is unique, even in our culture. I think a lot of the relationships that we\u2019re used to encountering are scripted. They\u2019re either on television\u2014and even if they\u2019re brilliantly written, they are written\u2014or in the celebrity zone. We see people\u2019s relationships, we analyze them. We try to look at the tea leaves of whatever the photos are, in spite of ourselves. But we have no actual insight into what is happening.", "So we\u2019re going to play a clip of the first episode from this new season, \u201cThe Arc of Love.\u201d Give us a bit of context for what we\u2019ll hear.", "It is a young couple in their early twenties. They met in college, in Iowa, where they were the only two Mexicans, but she was an international student and he was a Latino from Texas. Every month she crosses the border from Mexico to come and visit him. And there is enormous pressure on the relationship to, basically, make sure that they can continue to be together. And so romance is pitted against immigration. Would this relationship evolve at the speed that it has if there wasn\u2019t the pressure of being afraid every time she crosses the border?", "One thing that strikes me is the amount of raw emotion here. Often, on your show, men are really vulnerable and open up about the pressures that are on them and the feelings that I think we all know society tells them not to express so openly. I\u2019m curious what you hear when you listen to this particular clip.", "I hear the plight of a responsible son\u2014who, by the way, at twenty-one, gave the passport to his mother. He gave citizenship to his mom, and with that he set her free, and for the first time she could go out and get a job. And it has completely transformed the entire relationship between the mother and the father, who had met only one time before they got married, and had a rather miserable time.", "There is a certain kind of son who is often living between a rather rough, sometimes grandiose father and a helpless mother. And he finds himself covering the unholy triangle. That\u2019s this boy. And so he wants to save her. And he actually did, by giving her the papers. And he finds himself now with this woman, actually re\u00ebnacting, for the second time, a similar story.", "I have never really participated in the notion that men don\u2019t talk, men can\u2019t talk about their pains. I mean, they have a different way of going about it. Sometimes they need more time, and you just have to shut up and wait\u2014be quiet. And if you don\u2019t interrupt, it will come.", "And then you have to provide a compassionate environment that allows them to experience their experience, whatever it is. You know, everybody\u2019s talking about vulnerability. And I\u2019m not sure that \u201cvulnerability\u201d is necessarily the best word to use when talking with men. I talk about \u201cintegrity,\u201d and I talk about \u201chonorable.\u201d Meanwhile, they\u2019re sharing plenty of vulnerability, but it is a word that feels more masculine to them.", "But would that maybe reinforce a certain sense of cultural coding? We all know that \u201chonor\u201d is considered a masculine quality, and isn\u2019t the idea of being \u201chonorable\u201d the same?", "No, no. Because \u201chonorable\u201d is about how you behave and how you feel that you are maintaining a sense of integrity and pride in your behavior. \u201cHonor\u201d is the counterforce of shame.", "It\u2019s O.K. to use language that makes sense. If I like art, you\u2019re going to work with me and use metaphors that are related to art. And you don\u2019t feel like you are playing into a code because you\u2019ve used language that speaks to me. I\u2019m not afraid of that. What is important is the experience itself. I didn\u2019t make this man cry; it was waiting to come out. So you just need to make room and stay out of the way. Am I missing something in your question?", "I think it\u2019s a hard question in general. We\u2019ve seen over the past year how deep some of these assumptions about what masculinity is, what femininity is, go, and also how painful and destructive they really can be when they don\u2019t go questioned.", "I\u2019m not busy feeling like I\u2019m reinforcing a status quo. I think that, at this moment, there is such a sense that every word is fraught and every word can lock you into something. To me, most couples come because they\u2019re stuck. They\u2019re repeating the same thing over and over again, and they really think that if they do it one more time, it will finally yield some better results.", "Of course, it doesn\u2019t. So what you do in couples therapy is like crust\u2014you just try to loosen it first. That experience of him actually talking like that to her allows her to see him very differently. Then you watch to see if her response to his new behavior is going to be adapted to what she\u2019s seeing, or if she\u2019s going to continue to do the usual without noticing that he\u2019s completely different in front of her.", "And what you\u2019re aiming for is flexibility and adaptability, so that these two people can engage in multiple different configurations with each other, and not all the time the same thing.", "Let\u2019s go to another clip, from the show at the end of this current season. And, because the new season is called \u201cThe Arc of Love,\u201d we start with the couple we just heard, who are in their twenties, and now we\u2019re with a much older couple. They\u2019re two divorce lawyers, and they\u2019re actually divorced, but, interestingly, they found that divorce has enabled them to have a better relationship than they did when they were married.", "Why did this couple come to you? This is a couple who is essentially done being a couple. It\u2019s an unusual moment to start couples therapy.", "Or they\u2019ve actually finally become the couple they always wanted to be but couldn\u2019t under the rubric called marriage. They had to step outside of the institution and all its constraints, and all its political infrastructure, to actually be able to finally define the relationship they wanted.", "I have an idea of why they came, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s their idea of why they came. Their idea of why they came was because they feel very strongly about not having a divisive divorce. She came out of a background in which Mom and Dad constantly berated each other, and she wanted so much for that not to be replicated. So they have actually done a lot to protect the son. They travel together. They have family holidays together. They have everything they actually wanted without the power dynamic that poisoned their relationship.", "I think they came because, on some level, I think he fantasized that he would want to have a new relationship with her that is also romantic, and intimate. But he never said it, and so it never came out. Maybe it\u2019s my fantasy.", "One thing we don\u2019t hear in this clip is that, toward the end of their relationship, he had an affair.", "Right.", "Your last book, which is called \u201cThe State of Affairs,\u201d is a rather unconventional view of affairs\u2014what they are, and what they do to a couple. If I understand correctly, for the last seven years of your therapy practice, you\u2019ve been seeing couples exclusively who were dealing with infidelity. And your idea is that it does not necessarily spell the end. It just spells one end.", "I wanted to write a book about modern relationships through the lens of infidelity, because infidelity is about betrayal, and secrecy, and deception, and duplicity, and love, and passion, and lust, and vengeance, and possessiveness\u2014it\u2019s the entire human drama, and, I thought, except for the opera, where does one go for this?", "So I thought it is an incredible lens to look at one of the worst crises: How did infidelity become, in such a short amount of time, one of the leading causes of divorce in the West? That\u2019s a very important change to marriage, you know\u2014", "You mean because, before, people would not divorce over it?", "Well, marriage was basically this institution that you did once, and that was it. There was no exit. And basically fidelity was an imposition on women, in order to know whose kids you need to feed and who gets the cows when I die. It was an economic thing. It had nothing to do with love. And men practically had a license to cheat, with all kinds of explanations for why it\u2019s in their nature to roam.", "So infidelity has existed since marriage was invented. It\u2019s the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible, so somebody understood the human inclination for transgression. I wanted to understand, Why do people cheat? And why do people in happy relationships cheat\u2014which is never assumed to be the case because the notion is, if you have everything you want at home, there should be no reason to go elsewhere. Hence, if you go elsewhere, there must be something missing.", "It\u2019s a tautology. I\u2019ve seen so many people who are actually not at all in bad relationships who have divorced. So, then, why has divorce not made infidelity obsolete?", "Do you have a working definition of love?", "It\u2019s a verb. That\u2019s the first thing. It\u2019s an active engagement with all kinds of feelings\u2014positive ones and primitive ones and loathsome ones. But it\u2019s a very active verb. And it\u2019s often surprising how it can kind of ebb and flow. It\u2019s like the moon. We think it\u2019s disappeared, and suddenly it shows up again. It\u2019s not a permanent state of enthusiasm. I\u2019m thirty-five years in a relationship, I practice. And I have two boys\u2014I practice. It\u2019s not just romantic love.", "I think that definition today of love\u2014\u201cyou are my everything\u201d\u2014where you really see it, this complete exaltation, is in wedding vows. Have you ever noticed? I mean, it\u2019s, \u201cI will wipe every tear that streams down your face before you even notice it\u2019s going down.\u201d I think a realistic vow is \u201cI will fuck up on a regular basis, and, on occasion, I\u2019ll admit it.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "8d7cbbca-7e7d-3e7f-b83a-251bcad1a2d9", "keywords": ["thats", "think", "esther", "love", "couple", "perel", "relationships", "really", "actually", "interview", "enthusiasm", "thing", "state", "marriage", "couples", "permanent", "come"], "title": "Love Is Not a Permanent State of Enthusiasm: An Interview with Esther Perel", "summary": "So I think that\u2019s the big thing that is changing: what used to be defined by rules and duty and obligation now has to take place in conversation.\nYou have a podcast called \u201cWhere Should We Begin?,\u201d in which you do a session of couple\u2019s therapy with a couple that\u2019s never come to you before.\nI actually think it is unique, even in our culture.\nTo me, most couples come because they\u2019re stuck.\nWhy did this couple come to you?", "authors": ["Alexandra Schwartz", "Alice Munro", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Rachel Aviv", "Jane Mayer", "Richard Brody", "Zo\u00eb Heller"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
