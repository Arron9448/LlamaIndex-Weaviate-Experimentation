Facebook lists 80 different data categories it uses, for purposes from tracking users around the web to personalising the app.", "Google, however, has yet to provide its own labels. The company only has to do so when it updates its apps, which it stopped doing late last year. The iOS version of Google Chrome, for instance, was updated roughly every two weeks throughout 2020, until two months ago when it received its last update. Google Photos was updated almost weekly until two months ago; so too were YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail.", "In fact, of the 86 apps Google has published on the iOS App Store, only three \u2013 Google Slides, Google Play Music and TV, and Google Translate \u2013 have been updated in 2021. Of those three, just one \u2013 Google Translate \u2013 has a privacy label, which lists 25 ways personal data may be used.", "The vast majority of the remaining 83 apps received their most recent update two months ago, shortly before the new requirements came into effect.", "On Wednesday night, Google\u2019s apps began to complain about the lack of updates. According to user reports posted on social media, a number of apps including Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos issued notices warning their users that the app was \u201cout of date\u201d, despite the fact the users were on the latest version.", "\u201cYou should update this app,\u201d the warning read. \u201cThe version you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.\u201d", "Google was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian , but a spokesperson told the tech site The Verge that the error message was a \u201cbug\u201d. Others such as the TechMeme editor, Spencer Dailey, speculated that the \u201cbug\u201d was in fact \u201can automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated\u201d, which was not expected to be triggered since in normal times a two month-old version of the app would definitely be out of date.", "Google will shortly face further pressures from Apple\u2019s privacy push. In a forthcoming update to iOS, a new feature called \u201cApp Tracking Transparency\u201d will require applications to ask for permission before they are able to track users around the web. The setting has sparked strong pushback from Facebook, which argues it will hurt online advertising, but to date Google has been quiet about how it intends to respond to the requirement."], "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "keywords": ["apps", "apple", "feel", "update", "users", "drags", "google", "strain", "standoff", "app", "ios", "uses", "firms", "updated", "privacy", "version"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
