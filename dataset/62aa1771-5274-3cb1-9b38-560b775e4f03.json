Phelps offers several suggestions:", "Ensure the technology experience accounts for multiple user perspectives.", "\u201cWhat is important to a CEO is different than what\u2019s important to a CIO, and a CIO\u2019s perspective is different from a sales executive, which could be very different from a sales employee,\u201d Phelps says.", "Focus on the experience that matters from different users\u2019 perspectives.", "\u201cFor example, a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system that provides monthly sales dashboards is useful to a sales executive,\u201d he says. However, the same system might not help sales staff calculate their commissions without additional steps (such as the use of a spreadsheet). \u201cThe technology experience that motivates sales staff is quickly learning how much money they will make on a deal.\u201d", "Explain why more popular technologies are not deployed.", "\u201cThe coolest or easiest-to-use technology sometimes has the most significant security risks,\u201d Phelps explains. \u201cIn some cases, sensitive data may not encrypted at all, and in today\u2019s highly-regulated environment, you cannot compromise security and data privacy to chase every shiny new object.\u201d", "Also, some software available for free to consumers could be quite expensive when it is licensed for businesses.", "\u201cAnd, existing software may do 90% of what users want, but at one-fifth the cost, and it\u2019s often hard to justify spending more for that incremental 10% gain in functionality,\u201d Phelps says.", "Phelps believes that it is also important for companies to measure engagement: whether employees are satisfied with a technology solution and how willing they are to use it.", "Yet another issue is that employees may view technology as the enemy.", "\u201cUnfortunately, technology is being largely deployed today with the narrow goal of increasing efficiency,\u201d according to John Hagel III, co-chairman of the Deloitte Center for the Edge. \u201cIn this context, many workers are fearful because they are concerned that their leaders are simply looking for an opportunity to automate their work and cut costs by reducing the payroll.\u201d", "However, Hagel says that employees can be motivated to embrace technology if companies can show them how technology can actually increase the value employees are adding to the company.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about doing their existing tasks faster and cheaper, it\u2019s about freeing up time so that they can focus on ways to create even more value by addressing unseen problems and opportunities.\u201d Instead of taking a top-down view of technology, Hagel recommends adopting a bottom-up approach to help employees understand how technology can benefit them.", "Companies should also maintain a certain level of human interaction. For example, while technology is great for providing the tools to assess an employee\u2019s performance, it doesn\u2019t take the place of a face-to-face meeting to discuss problems and concerns. Also, sensitive HR questions might require more engagement than a chatbot can provide. When there\u2019s a balance between technology and the human factor, employees are more likely to believe that the company cares for them.", "Browse technology courses for executives", "--", "Terri Williams is a freelance writer who covers leadership topics for The Economist Careers Network."], "pubDate": null, "authors": [], "keywords": ["integration", "view", "technology", "phelps", "getting", "leaders", "workplace", "employees", "staff", "sales", "experience", "different", "board", "work"], "id": "62aa1771-5274-3cb1-9b38-560b775e4f03", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://execed.economist.com/blog/industry-trends/workplace-technology-integration-getting-employees-board"}
