And on the spectrum of mayoral candidates, they are also more moderate on policing matters, even as they promote criminal justice reform. (Indeed, Mr. Adams, a Black former police officer who says he has experienced police brutality himself, spent much of his career urging changes in the system, but he is also a onetime Republican who speaks often about the constructive role he believes policing can play in promoting public safety.)", "Those stances are sharply at odds with the anti-real estate, anti-corporate and \u201cdefund the police\u201d rhetoric that has animated the left-wing New York scene in recent years \u2014 and in particular after the killing of George Floyd last May \u2014 but that has largely been untested in a citywide race.", "As more voters tune in, the contest will offer the clearest picture yet of the political mood of a large, racially diverse city on issues surrounding economic recovery, a rise in violent crime and deep inequality that the coronavirus pandemic has only worsened.", "Across the city, younger left-wing activists have been part of a coalition that has shaped legislative and House races.
