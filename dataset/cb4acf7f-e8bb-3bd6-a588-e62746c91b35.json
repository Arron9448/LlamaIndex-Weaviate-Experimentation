And while menswear has never been more casual, references to the uniform are still present in contemporary collections today. So just what is it about a man in uniform?", "From military, to work and sports, uniforms command attention, and the big screen has created a romanticized version of the men behind uniforms.", "\"Is it an authority thing?\" asked Luke Day, editor of GQ Style. \"Is it a dominance thing? I think ultimately there's a romantic ideal to uniforms because most men in uniforms are heroes.\"", "Richard Gere in \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" Credit: Paramount Pictures", "Many of the staple items usually found in a stereotypical man's wardrobe -- be it deck shoes, the MA1 bomber jacket, chinos, khakis, epaulettes, a parka or field coat -- are directly descendant of uniforms.", "\"All menswear is uniform,\" said Julian Ganio, menswear consultant for Fendi. \"It's so tribal, something that's planted in (a man's) brain.\"", "Standardized dressing has been created to bind people together, but also to set them apart from other groups. \"Men like to be part of a gang,\" said Ganio. \"We want to be with like-minded men. And we want to belong.\"", "England football team in the 1990 World Cup.

According to Groves, communication between men is dictated by \"unspoken (style) judgments,\" but the historic narrative behind how men came to dress the way they do remains unexplored territory.", "Red Wool Greatcoat, by Nicholas Yip, 2017 Credit: Westminster Menswear Archive", "The 170-piece show, which draws an alignment between uniform and fashion, is in part a showcase of the larger Westminster archive, as well as a smart retort to the dearth of menswear exhibits on the art and fashion calendar. \"At the recent Dior show [at the V&A museum],\" said Groves, \"there was no menswear. Nothing. The same at the McQueen.\"", "Groves took a prosaic approach when curating \"Invisible Men,\" by drawing on the seemingly invisible fashion of British men -- largely missing from museums -- and its roots in uniforms. For this exhibition, he chose to celebrate the style that begins on football terraces and in local pubs, the elements of which are passed down, from father to son, and then twisted to each new generation's tastes.", "A Manchester United fan wears a Daniel James shirt ahead of the Premier League match at Old Trafford, Manchester.
