And this case that is being depicted on Oxygen in 'Florida Man Murders' on Jan. 9 is by far the strangest and most impactful case on everybody that I've ever been involved with.

That's why I said it's a dark comedy.\"", "\"The subject is so dark and people die so you don't want to laugh.

They torture him, burning him with lighters, pistol-whipping him, shoving gun barrels in his mouth \u2013 just everything you can imagine. He was treated worse than a World War II prisoner.\"", "\"And then eventually, against all odds, this guy escapes,\" added Ferrer. \"They tried to kill him. They fail at killing him.

However, according to prosecutors, Furton had been pumped so full of tranquilizers that her chest muscles paralyzed her lungs and she would die of an overdose.", "The gang would be further mired by other mishaps in their attempts to dispose of the bodies of the couple \u2013 even returning a bloody chain saw to Home Depot after its motor burned when the group forgot to add motor oil for its operation and Doorbal tried to saw Furton\u2019s head off.", "BIZZARE CORONAVIRUS TEXTS LEAD TO HUSBAND'S ARREST IN WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE", "\"That chain saw got jammed in Krisztina's hair,\" lead prosecutor Gail Levine told the jury in the trial, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. \"So they used the next tool of trade: the axe. Whap! Whap! Whap!\"", "Other mishaps also included attempting to grill the body parts of Griga and Furton.", "In the end, the Sun Gym Gang stuffed the torsos of Grida and Furton into 55-gallon drums and attempted to burn them.
