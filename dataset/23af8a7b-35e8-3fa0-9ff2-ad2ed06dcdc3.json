She navigates carefully across the landscape of blackbrush and fragrant junipers to inspect the stump of a Joshua tree. Much of the tree\u2019s trunk, branches, and dagger-shaped leaves are sprawled across the desert floor\u2014most likely the casualty of a gust of wind that snapped it like a toothpick.", "The tree was one of thousands that Dr. Sweet and her team examined in a recent study that predicted a worrisome future for the iconic western Joshua tree, Yucca brevifolia, within the national park due to climate change. The tree was less than 25% alive during Dr. Sweet and her team\u2019s last recording. Now, the tree is dead.", "Dr. Lynn Sweet examining a dead Western Joshua tree. Photographed by Nich McElroy", "Dr. Sweet\u2019s study published in Ecosphere in 2019 suggested that if greenhouse gas emission rates continue \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d the species\u2019 habitat will shrink by 99.98% by the end of the century, almost completely erasing Joshua trees from the park. The study\u2019s most optimistic model predicts the species\u2019 range in the park will decrease by just over 80%. The small percentage of trees remaining are predicted to migrate to higher elevations of the park, sheltering in refugia, areas where the trees are buffered from unfavorable conditions catalyzed by climate change.", "\u201cClimate change is like a flash flood,\u201d Dr. Sweet says. \u201cJoshua trees thrive on the long broad plateaus the park is famous for, but outrunning the wave of warming temperatures of climate change in these valleys is much more difficult than migrating a short distance uphill.\u201d Dr. Sweet points far in the distance at the high mountains where the predicted remaining habitat for the trees would persist by the end of the century.
