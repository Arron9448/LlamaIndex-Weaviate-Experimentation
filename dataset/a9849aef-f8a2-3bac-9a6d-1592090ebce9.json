His happy-go-lucky manner and godlike popularity with many football fans put the broadcaster and football pundit in a strong position. But as the show progressed he became more morose and irascible \u2013 worn down by hunger, isolation from his family and clashes with certain camp mates. He was the fifth celebrity to be voted out.", "Now as he sits in one of the Guardian\u2019s meeting rooms \u2013 relaxed, legs crossed, leaning back \u2013 he says the show\u2019s producers had been chasing him for seven years.

(No.)", "What he wasn\u2019t expecting was the mental challenge \u2013 an intense environment (hunger, arguments, isolation) and the stress of the challenges. \u201cIn hindsight, if I\u2019m being totally honest, I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he says.", "Yet, he says, his time there was still a personal triumph because it showed him how far he had come. \u201cThe problems I\u2019ve had since I was a child \u2013 that I\u2019ve got a lot of help with \u2013 the impatience and the anger issues \u2026 I was quite pleased with the way I dealt with that in the end.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest On I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock", "Wright has never been someone to shy away from his flaws. He sought professional help for his anger issues after an infamous incident in 1999 when he smashed up a referee\u2019s dressing room after being sent off. In truth, though, Wright had been battling to control his anger long before he stepped on to a football pitch.", "Born in Woolwich, south London, Wright grew up on the Honor Oak estate in Brockley. He was raised by his mother and stepfather (his biological father left when he was about 18 months old), with his older brother, Maurice, an older stepbrother and a younger stepsister. It was a chaotic and oppressive childhood, he says.", "\u201cI never had the kind of tactile love my missus and I give to my girls now,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing hugged wasn\u2019t something I remember happening a lot,\u201d he says. Although he loved Maurice, he never bonded with his other siblings. His stepfather \u2013 who he has described as a weed-smoking, gambling womaniser \u2013 was cruel and neglectful to Wright (\u201cHe was rough with my mum and rough with all of us kids,\u201d he told the Players\u2019 Tribune), while his mother rarely showed him support or affection. Yet there was one adult who did take an interest in Wright\u2019s early development: his teacher, Sydney Pigden. For a time, he was the only positive male role model in Wright\u2019s life and would tell Wright to overcome the \u201cred mist\u201d by counting to 10 (\u201cIt always made me smile because, when I was young, it never worked\u201d).", "He felt rejected, he says, by his family, but also by football clubs: Wright\u2019s footballing career is notorious for its late start. \u201cIt was something I had to deal with from a very, very young age,\u201d he says. \u201cRejected by a mum, stepfather, older brother, little sister \u2026 then you come out of the house and everybody talks about how good you are at football, but you get rejected by everybody you go for trial for.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Playing for Arsenal in 1997.

He didn\u2019t waste the opportunity. After becoming the club\u2019s third-highest goalscorer he was bought by Arsenal in 1991 for \u00a32.5m.", "Wright\u2019s record on the pitch in the years that followed propelled him to the status of club legend, then national hero. He won numerous trophies with Arsenal and became its record scorer, with 185 goals (only beaten by Thierry Henry in 2005). As one Nike billboard slogan had it: \u201cBehind every great goalkeeper there\u2019s a ball from Ian Wright.\u201d", "For Wright, the best year of his career was 1992, when he moved to Arsenal and won the golden boot (nicking it off his BBC pal Gary Lineker, no less). But the achievements, he says, were less important than the fact they were accomplished alongside the late David Rocastle, the childhood friend he grew up with (Rocastle is the reason Wright supported Arsenal in the first place).", "Rocastle developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma and died in 2001, aged 33. It was the first major bereavement Wright had experienced, and it devastated him. \u201cI\u2019ve not come to terms with his passing,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we were in a place where the lighting was darker, you know, I can easily snap off into pure emotion. I can\u2019t even speak. I think about him every day.\u201d", "Rocastle\u2019s wife and daughters are like family to Wright. \u201cI will never come to terms with it because I\u2019ll always feel that, at 33, one of the loveliest men in the world was taken and it was just so difficult to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cMy biggest arguments now are with God. Sometimes I believe, sometimes I don\u2019t. I just ask him: \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d", "Off the pitch for some of his years at Arsenal, things were less harmonious; his swift fame and commercial success (including the lucrative sponsorship from Nike) took its toll. \u201cI got caught up with people who didn\u2019t have my best interests at heart,\u201d says Wright. \u201cI got caught up with women who were using me. I got caught up with believing the hype, just because I was playing great football. You kind of get into this hedonistic mindset where you think everything\u2019s just amazing, you could do anything you want, like you\u2019re breathing different air.\u201d", "In his 2016 book, A Life in Football: My Autobiography, Wright says of these years that he came to hate himself. Yet, he says, he cannot regret these experiences \u201cbecause it shapes you\u201d and he understands why he behaved the way he did. \u201cWhen you grew up in a situation where the love wasn\u2019t forthcoming, then all of a sudden, you get into a situation where you are successful and everybody loves you, you can get a little bit high on that.\u201d", "\u201cThis is why counselling is so good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re able to go back and let people know what you were going through, and you can only try to apologise and make people understand that you were just losing it.\u201d The counselling also encouraged him to try to reconcile with his mother.", "\u201cAs time went by we spoke,\u201d he says, slowly wringing his hands: \u201cShe said she had her own problems as well. Whatever her problems were I always wanted to find out, but she was never forthcoming. She didn\u2019t want to speak about those things. I\u2019m not going to put a spotlight on her. I learned to deal with it myself because at the end of the day, you can only heal yourself.\u201d", "Wright has eight children \u2013 with ages ranging from nine to 38 \u2013 with four women. He has said he \u201cfell into\u201d fatherhood during his turbulent young adulthood, although Wright adopted his eldest child, the former professional footballer Shaun Wright-Phillips, when he was just 19 and Wright-Phillips was a baby. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have such a disturbing time with my stepfather, I probably wouldn\u2019t have adopted Shaun to try to give him as much love as I could.

I didn\u2019t need money.\u201d", "He was advised, he says, that \u201cmanagement is really tough. \u2018Why do you want to do that? Television\u2019s waiting.\u2019 And I listened. That\u2019s the only thing I regret.\u201d", "He has gone on to have a successful career in TV and radio, and is still a popular pundit on football shows including Match of the Day. But at first, he says, the reception was not what he had hoped for. \u201cYou should have seen some of the stuff they used to say: \u2018He can\u2019t finish a sentence. What\u2019s he doing on there?\u2019\u201d says Wright. At the time, there were few black chatshow hosts on British TV and I ask whether he felt the strength of the criticism was because of his race.", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say just race,\u201d says Wright, \u201cbut we know that in black culture when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re told that you have to try twice as hard because you can\u2019t give the establishment the opportunity to say: \u2018Well, if you\u2019d worked this hard, you would have been able to do it.\u2019\u201d", "We meet as racism in football is, once more, dominating the headlines, after a fan was accused of making monkey noises at the Manchester United player Fred during the recent Manchester derby. Wright is clear that racism at football matches needs to be dealt with more vigorously. \u201cEverybody talks about education and we do need to educate young people, but when you look at the people who are racially abusing players now, they\u2019re older people, so education is wasted on those people. Those people need to be punished severely so it can be a deterrent, so people will see that when you racially abuse someone in this ground you are out for life.\u201d", "In the wake of the incident, Gary Neville suggested Boris Johnson had fuelled racism with his rhetoric. Although Wright doesn\u2019t disagree, he\u2019s not sure how helpful this is. \u201cBoris Johnson may be involved in some way, just because it\u2019s intrinsically linked with the things he says and what he does. But you can\u2019t really point at one person.\u201d", "As Neville\u2019s comments highlight, football players past and present have become less afraid of making political statements in recent years. The week before the general election the Arsenal vice-captain H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn posted a tweet encouraging young people to vote. Then signed off with \u201c#FuckBoris\u201d. Many of the replies called on Beller\u00edn to leave politics out of the game.", "\u201cI can\u2019t take people who just sit there pointing their finger [saying] H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn shouldn\u2019t be saying that,\u201d says Wright. \u201cFootball and politics are always linked. Why shouldn\u2019t he, somebody who is affected by the government, have an opinion on Boris?", "\u201cYou want to see footballers have more of an opinion,\u201d Wright insists. \u201cHector used his platform to ask young people to vote. To have a say in what happens in your country. Is that a bad thing?
