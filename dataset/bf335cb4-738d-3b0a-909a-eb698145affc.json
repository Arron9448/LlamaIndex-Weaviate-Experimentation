All of the talk in Washington these days is about China, or our crazy dysfunctional politics, or the pandemic and its consequences. Putin seems determined to push Russia back onto the agenda, too. Since an offhanded remark by President Joe Biden, in a recent interview, agreeing that Putin was a \u201ckiller,\u201d Russia\u2019s strongman has sent an alarming buildup of troops and weaponry to the front lines with Ukraine\u2014an escalation that threatens the renewal of a hot war in Europe, with America and Russia on opposing sides. Inside Russia, Putin this week signed legislation allowing him to be leader for life\u2014or at least until 2036, when he will be eighty-three years old. Putin\u2019s leading political rival, the jailed dissident Alexey Navalny, meanwhile, is on a hunger strike, suffering a health crisis so severe that his doctors warn he may die unless Putin orders his jailers to relent. Navalny\u2019s supporters are begging the Biden Administration to intervene, and on Thursday, I spoke with Vladimir Milov, a Navalny adviser who has been pushing the new White House team for a tougher response to the dissident\u2019s \u201cclearly deteriorating\u201d condition. Milov told me sanctions that Biden issued last month, after Navalny\u2019s imprisonment, had \u201cessentially no consequences,\u201d and that new measures punishing Putin and his inner circle of oligarchs are a \u201cnecessary second step.\u201d", "In Washington, Kremlinologists are convinced that these provocative actions constitute a deliberate effort by Putin to test America\u2019s new President. We know what Donald Trump would do in this situation: nothing. That is exactly what he did when Putin\u2019s agents poisoned Navalny last year, with the banned chemical agent Novichok, and carried out the sweeping SolarWinds hack in the United States. In no foreign-policy area is the rhetorical contrast between the last U.S. President, who openly fawned over Putin, and the current one, who disdains him, more significant. But will Biden prove different in his actions? On Thursday, I spoke with a senior Administration official who promised an unspecified \u201crange of other actions\u201d against Russia for its 2020 outrages; confirmed that more Navalny-related sanctions are also being considered; and warned of \u201cmeaningful costs and consequences\u201d if Russia actually undertakes new military action against Ukraine.", "But there\u2019s no question in my mind that the Biden team smells a trap. The last thing they want is another four years of \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia,\u201d of endless rounds of new sanctions and cable-news coverage of the latest sniping between Biden and the tough guy in the Kremlin. The truth is that, even after intervening in two successive U.S. elections on behalf of Trump, Russia has so far hardly figured at the top of the new Biden Administration\u2019s priority list. For its first seventy-five days, Biden\u2019s Presidency has been understandably focussed on domestic crises\u2014from the pandemic and the economy to gun violence and a racial reckoning. Where geopolitics are concerned, Biden\u2019s senior advisers have said that countering China is their top priority\u2014and the U.S\u2019s primary challenge this century.", "In a practical sense, the Administration\u2019s international achievements so far have been in its most pressing project: undoing what Trump wrought. Just this week, the State Department announced that it was restoring hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestine which Trump had cut off. In Vienna, U.S. and Iranian diplomats have gathered to begin hashing out the terms by which the United States can re\u00ebnter the nuclear deal that Trump exited, in 2018. Biden has already recommitted to the Paris climate accord, from which Trump pulled out, rejoined the World Health Organization, which Trump quit in a snit over its handling of the coronavirus; and begun revitalizing alliances and international organizations weakened by Trump\u2019s rejection.", "Less tangibly, but perhaps as significantly, the new Administration has radically changed the surround sound of American diplomacy. \u201cSwagger\u201d was the mantra of the Trump team, and the former President spent four years praising adversaries and trashing allies. The Biden approach is best summed up, for me, by an exchange that I had with former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now Biden\u2019s special climate envoy. On the day, in February, that the U.S. officially rejoined the Paris accord, I interviewed Kerry, at an event in Washington hosted by the Italian Ambassador. When I asked what Kerry was seeking from his European counterparts, after four years of American self-segregation, he replied, \u201cForgiveness.\u201d The return to the agreement, he added, \u201cwon\u2019t be done just with words\u2014it has to be done with actions. We can\u2019t talk our way back into legitimacy.\u201d", "But, while Biden\u2019s new foreign-policy team\u2014led by the national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, two longtime Biden aides from the Obama Administration\u2014has been busy figuring out how to re-legitimize America in the eyes of the world, Putin has once again proved adept at forcing himself into the center of Washington\u2019s attention. I spoke with several leading Russia experts, and all of them agreed that Putin\u2019s provocations are both worrisome and designed, at least in part, to test Biden\u2019s resolve. Whether or not Putin likes being called a killer, he surely likes being ignored even less. He is also a savvy adversary of the United States, after more than two decades in power. Biden is his fifth American President, and Putin has challenged every single one at some point. \u201cThe Russians want to be a top priority for the United States,\u201d Alina Polyakova, a Russia scholar who runs the Center for European Policy Analysis, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a desire to make themselves known at a time when they are not being noticed.\u201d And also a chance to tweak Biden, she added, \u201cto make it clear it doesn\u2019t matter who the U.S. President is\u2014the U.S. is still feckless, not a lot of action behind those words.\u201d", "No matter how much of a drama Putin manufactures\u2014and his recent actions have me thinking of Kim Jong Un and the North Koreans\u2019 attention-seeking nuclear-missile tests\u2014it\u2019s hard to envision a major Biden ramp-up against Russia beyond more sanctions, more tough words, and a much more co\u00f6rdinated approach with European allies. When Russia\u2019s military moves in Ukraine became apparent, last week, it did not go unnoticed that pushback came in a single, choreographed day, both from top U.S. officials\u2014who all called their Kremlin counterparts to protest\u2014and from European leaders. On Capitol Hill, the Republican senator Ted Cruz has placed a hold on Biden nominees for key posts, in hopes of forcing the Administration to push more aggressively to stop Russia building the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline to Germany; Cruz is currently blocking the nomination of Wendy Sherman for State Department deputy over the issue. But the pipeline is more than ninety-per-cent complete, and the Biden team seems disinclined to blow up relations with Germany over a project that is likely to be completed anyway.", "My conversation with the senior Administration official suggested that there is zero desire from the Biden team to find itself consumed by recent years\u2019 familiar cycles of Russian outrages followed by American reactions. When I asked how the Administration views Russia, the official called it \u201ca serious and significant threat to the United States that needs to be managed in a way that gets us onto a path of stability.\u201d This does not sound like an Administration that is ready for more escalation following the promised retaliations for Russia\u2019s 2020 provocations. \u201cWe want to execute that response. We want to stand up and defend American interests and sovereignty, and we will do so. And then we want to communicate a clear view that it is in the United States\u2019 interests to find a way to deal with the challenges we have with Russia without it overtaking or overwhelming the rest of our agenda,\u201d the official said.", "But Putin gets a vote here, too. These are Obama veterans, after all, and they well remember when their \u201creset\u201d policy with Putin was blown up, when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula, in 2014, from Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re sitting around saying, \u2018Oh, Russia, who cares? Let\u2019s just try to shelve it,\u2019 \u201d the official said. \u201cVladimir Putin has made clear, and a lesson we learned from the Obama Administration is: do not discount Russia\u2019s capacity for significant disruption, and for its direct assault on core American interests.\u201d The Biden team may not want to get \u201ctrapped,\u201d but an actual Russian attack in eastern Ukraine, would be another matter entirely.", "New Administrations in Washington always face a clamor to act\u2014now!\u2014on both the pressing crises of the moment and the inherited disasters of their predecessors. Savvy world leaders have long since learned to understand and play the Washington clock\u2014whether in pushing, as Putin is right now, early in a new Administration or scheduling invasions late in a lame-duck Presidency. (See Putin\u2019s war in Georgia in the summer of 2008, and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip in early 2009.) The Biden team is dealing with Putin\u2019s provocations at a moment when it has virtually no confirmed State Department officials besides the Secretary of State himself, no senior director for Russia at the National Security Council, and no Biden-appointed Assistant Secretary of State overseeing the region.", "But I keep coming back to something that Milov, the Navalny adviser, said. What Biden and other leaders lack right now on Russia is not so much a sanctions list that hits the right Putin allies, or a round of tough phone calls; it\u2019s a strategy for a changing world. Just as with China, the old American approach of carrots and sticks\u2014the one that has lasted more or less since the end of the Cold War\u2014is no longer working. Putin has declared himself a \u201cfull-scale enemy,\u201d Milov said, and should at last be treated as such. \u201cThe West really lacks a coherent approach to Russia at this moment,\u201d he argued. Violations by Putin\u2019s government are still treated as one-offs: the jailing of a dissident, the hacking of U.S. government agencies, election interference or the use of banned chemical weapons or armed incursions against its neighbors. Right now, the crisis is Navalny and Ukraine. Tomorrow, it will likely be something else. \u201cWe are going to keep bouncing back to the question of what we do about Russia\u2019s actions next time,\u201d Milov said. It might finally be the moment, Milov said, to move toward \u201cfull-scale containment.\u201d", "The Biden Administration is not there yet. And, even if it was, theirs is a world on fire, at home and abroad. Will Putin\u2019s latest outrages force their way onto the top of Biden\u2019s priority list? Milov understands that the odds are low. \u201cThe Biden Administration has so much to repair,\u201d he acknowledged. Then he added, with a laugh, \u201cIf we were the only problem in the room. . . .\u201d"], "authors": ["Susan B. Glasser", "Susan B.
