The current precipitation is only 30% to 70% of what the state would expect to have seen during a normal year \u2013 with no more big rainfall events on the horizon for February.", "Precipitation in the form of rain \u2013 and snowfall at higher elevations \u2013 is critical because it refills reservoirs, packs away snow for spring runoff to feed drier parts of the state, and helps stem the risk of wildfires. It also allows California\u2019s agriculture to continue producing important crops.", "This year, the state saw a very delayed start to its annual rainy season, which is typically heaviest from January to March. Wildfires sparked as late as January. It\u2019s a sign that the window of time where rainfall and snow can add to the state\u2019s water reserves is shrinking, says John Abatzoglou, a climatology researcher at the University of California, Merced \u2013 and that window may be even narrower in the future.", "A study published this week showed that the onset of rains each fall has shifted back by a month over the past 60 years. That corresponds as well to drier fall weather, and an increase in the chance for fires to have devastating impacts, Abatzoglou says.", "Most of the state\u2019s water comes from an astonishingly low number of precipitation events \u2013 just three to five winter storms do the work of building up the snowpack and filling reservoirs. That makes California uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIn years where you miss out on one or two of those, you\u2019re probably going to struggle to get close to normal,\u201d says Abatzoglou.", "Date palms near Mecca, California. The state\u2019s water-intensive agriculture industry depends on annual rainfall. Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images", "Part of the problem is that California tends toward the extremes \u2013 rainfall is either feast or famine. \u201cCalifornia is like the home run hitter that approaches and swings for the fences,\u201d says Abatzoglou. \u201cWe rarely get a single: it\u2019s either a home run or a strikeout.\u201d", "The moisture comes from the west, over the ocean, says Naomi Levine, an oceanographer at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe wind patterns over the Pacific dictate our weather a lot and in La Ni\u00f1a years [an ocean-atmosphere phenomenon currently under way and characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific], we tend to have drier years,\u201d she says. \u201cSo all in all the interannual oscillations are stacked up against us.\u201d", "Last year, even with one dry year we had a tremendous fire season Jay Lund, UC Davis professor", "The state had a fairly major drought from 2012-2016, says Jay Lund, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. The lesson from that period was that the first year of dryness is not so bad for most of California, in that cities and agriculture can withstand one or two parched years without too much trouble. \u201cBut if we get a third or fourth dry year in a row, that\u2019s when we see big problems with native species, as well as bigger economic impacts.\u201d", "Lund did a study on the economic impacts of the 2012-2016 drought and found that the dryness had a $9bn price tag at the end of four years \u2013 but in the years afterward, the costs were much higher. Analyses by Stanford University and the New York Times have found that wildfires have caused tens of billions of dollars in damage over of the last four years.", "He adds that since the state\u2019s forests still haven\u2019t recovered from that four-year drought, there\u2019s a bigger problem looming now \u2013 especially with warmer temperatures due to the human-caused climate crisis. \u201cLast year, even with one dry year, we had a tremendous fire season.\u201d", "Lund says that in the long term, California\u2019s famous forests might look different. It might be an ecosystem with fewer trees, closer to what the environment looked like in the early 1800s, before widespread European settlement. \u201cThe density of trees in CA forests today is probably higher than it was in the early 1800s because there have been fewer fires, but with a drier, warmer climate we\u2019ll probably see lower tree densities.\u201d That means that the state would be less susceptible to wildfires \u2013 but there are plenty of downsides for native species that rely on tree-laden forests for survival.", "A helicopter drops water on a 2020 fire in Orange county. Concerns are growing the a dry winter will make fire conditions this year even worse. Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA", "Agriculture is the state\u2019s biggest water user, and during dry years, when surface water is less available, cities pump more groundwater \u2013 which is likely to be problematic in the coming years.", "\u201cCurrently, the state\u2019s reservoirs are not as bad as they could be but the supply of groundwater \u2013 essential for agriculture \u2013 is not looking great because the majority of years in the past decade we\u2019ve been on the dry end,\u201d says Abatzoglou. \u201cIn the Central Valley, more and more water is being pumped for groundwater and that is not a sustainable situation. With another year of subpar precipitation, we are going to be sucking harder on that straw.\u201d", "In addition to a shorter window for precipitation, there is also evidence that winter rains will be heavier \u2013 and they come with their own problems, such as mudslides or floods. \u201cWith a warming climate, we do expect increases in heavy precipitation at the expense of moderate precipitation,\u201d says Abatzoglou \u2013 adding that it means fewer wet days in the future, but when those days come they may be soakers.", "For this year, there\u2019s only a slim chance \u2013 about 10% right now \u2013 that the state will reach normal rainfall totals. That may become the norm going forward. \u201cWe\u2019re banking on a miracle March or awesome April to dig out of this hole,\u201d says Abatzoglou. \u201cIn all likelihood, we\u2019re going to end the water year with another dry year.\u201d"], "authors": ["Katharine Gammon"], "keywords": ["farms", "water", "rainfall", "wildfires", "california", "californias", "abatzoglou", "states", "state", "winter", "precipitation", "trouble", "lows", "historic", "dry", "spells"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
