Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who arrived at the back of the chamber as the daylong session was underway, has the Democratic votes needed to make Trump just the third U.S. president to be impeached, exercising what she called \u2018one of the most solemn powers granted to us by the Constitution.\u2019 \u2026 Democrats overwhelmingly approved the rules for the debate, 228-197, with just two defections from Pelosi\u2019s ranks, an early indication of how the votes will eventually fall on the articles of impeachment. No Republicans supported the procedural vote, but Democrats picked up backing from Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan conservative, who left the GOP this year to become an independent over his support for impeachment.\u201d", "", "Trump to travel to Michigan to rally fans - Fox News: \u201cPresident Trump on Wednesday will be far away from Capitol Hill -- and the Washington establishment he has long criticized as an irredeemable \u2018swamp\u2019 -- as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives prepares to impeach him in a likely party-line vote on charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. Instead, the president will be on friendly turf in downtown Battle Creek, Mich., hosting a rally that may rank among his most defiant -- a marked contrast from the approach of former President Bill Clinton, who mostly stayed under the radar during his own impeachment proceedings in 1998. There will be unusually tight security near the Capitol building in Washington on Wednesday, Fox News was told, and some of those measures were visible Tuesday night.\u201d", "", "Political impact in swing states more muted than expected - WaPo: \u201cWhen the dust clears, the result is most likely to look more like a draw than a victory, say political strategists from both sides. Ten weeks of the House impeachment inquiry have spun an already polarized country through yet another centrifuge of outrage, further separating champions of the president from those who see him a danger to the country. Yet polls suggest few have been converted in their views of Trump by the allegations about his dealings with Ukraine, though the president has once again been shown to have behaved in a way most Americans do not like.\u201d", "", "House GOP wants to take their show to Senate side - ABC News: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is considering a mix of White House lawyers and some of the president\u2019s most aggressive defenders serving in the House of Representatives to play a larger role in his defense, multiple sources familiar with the internal discussions told ABC News. The debate over who could best represent the president in the Senate comes as the president\u2019s advisers have squabbled about what his impeachment defense before the Senate should look like, and who should be responsible for making the case for acquittal, the sources said.

Sorkin\u2019s dramatization of Harper Lee\u2019s novel, which opened on Broadway last December, is an unexpectedly probing work that refuses to let an American classic go unchallenged. Instead, it stages two trials: One is from the book, in which Scout\u2019s attorney father, Atticus Finch, defends Tom Robinson, an African American man accused of rape in 1930s Alabama, and tries to combat the community\u2019s entrenched racism. In Sorkin\u2019s play, the other trial is of Atticus\u2019s own nobility, and how it doesn\u2019t always square with his grander vision of justice. Though the adaptation broadly follows the narrative arc of Lee\u2019s novel, it uses Scout, her brother Jem, and her friend Dill (all played by adult actors) to cast a wary eye over some of the book\u2019s more idealistic details.\u201d", "", "Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.", "", "SCOREBOARD", "DEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING", "Biden: 26.6 points (\u2193 1 point from last wk.)", "Sanders: 18 points (\u2193 0.2 points from last wk.)", "Warren: 14.8 points (\u2193 3.6 points from last wk.)", "Buttigieg: 9.2 points (\u2191 0.6 points from last wk.)", "Bloomberg: 5.4 points (first listing)", "[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, USA Today/Suffolk University, NPR/PBS/Marist, Fox News and IBD.]", "", "TRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE", "Average approval: 43.6 percent", "Average disapproval: 51.2 percent", "Net Score: -7.6 percent", "Change from one week ago: \u2191 2 points", "[Average includes: CNBC: 40% approve - 49% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 43% approve - 52% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk University: 48% approve - 50% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]", "", "WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?", "You can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Presidential candidates are required to reveal their investments, businesses and streams of income. Only Bloomberg, fellow billionaire Tom Steyer and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick have yet to do so. Each of those candidates was late entering the Democratic presidential primary. Bloomberg, who has long considered a White House bid, sits atop a sprawling business empire and is worth more than $50 billion, easily making him the wealthiest candidate in the contest. \u2026 The FEC on Monday granted his request, giving him until Feb. 4 to file \u2014 one day after the Iowa caucuses.\u201d", "", "Buttigieg didn\u2019t fully disclose on bundlers - Politico: \u201cPete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign omitted more than 20 high-level fundraisers from a list of top bundlers it disclosed last week. The public list of bundlers, featuring more than 100 people who have raised at least $25,000 for Buttigieg, was meant to bring a close to more than a week of feuding between Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren over campaign transparency. But the list left off a number of people the Buttigieg campaign had previously touted as top donors in an internal campaign fundraising report obtained by POLITICO. They include uberwealthy supporters such as Boston power broker Jack Connors Jr. \u2014 who declared he was \u2018all in for Pete Buttigieg\u2019 in a June fundraiser invite \u2014 and Hollywood producer Jordan Horowitz, whose films include \u2018La La Land.\u2019\u201d", "", "RNC dumps New Hampshire director - Politico: \u201cThe Republican National Committee has fired the director of its Trump Victory Team in New Hampshire just four months after he was brought on to lead the party\u2019s statewide effort to reelect Donald Trump and deliver down-ballot gains for the GOP next fall.

Fearing former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach could win the Republican nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts and put an otherwise red seat in jeopardy, McConnell and other party insiders are desperate for Pompeo to run. But concern about the politically divisive Kobach aside, Republican strategists tend to agree that running for Senate is the better play for Pompeo if his White House ambitions are real, especially if President Trump loses reelection. For Pompeo, a Senate seat would help him stay relevant heading into the 2024 presidential campaign.
