With its sheltered harbour, surrounded by higgledy-piggledy cottages, the village used to be one of the most important fishing ports in the North East at its height 120 boats supported 300 families. Although not so busy now, the sea faring tradition is still strong - particularly for lobster fishing. The young Captain James Cook also lived there for a while as an apprentice shopkeeper, he must have nurtured a love of the sea from seeing the fishermen working! Today we enjoy the path less travelled with a guided walk. We amble through the village to the next village of Port Mulgrave walking some of the Cleveland Way, along the cliff tops, through quiet fields lanes and woodlands before circling back to Staithes, accompanied by a local walking expert. We then drive through the North Yorkshire moors park to Whitby where there is a chance to explore at leisure. There are plenty of things to see and explore here, from the ruins of Whitby\u2019s iconic Abbey, which inspired Bram Stoker to write \u201cDracula\u201d, making Whitby the place where count Dracula came ashore. The views from the headland are stunning. With its cobbled lanes leading to the traditional harbour, it\u2019s the perfect place to wander and explore the many shops and workshops that sell the famous Whitby jet, a semi-precious organic gemstone that can be polished to a mirror finish. The history of Whitby jet actually goes back to the bronze age, Romans in Britain used it in magical amulets but it was made most famous during the Victorian period when it was used as a mourning stone, these days it\u2019s made into traditional and more modern jewellery. It\u2019s also home to the Captain Cook memorial museum, where you can learn about the famous explorer\u2019s life. If that\u2019s not your thing, then maybe enjoy some of the world-famous fish and chips Whitby has to offer by the harbourside washed down with a locally brewed beer? We leave Whitby on the what has been described as one of the world\u2019s greatest heritage railway experiences \u201cThe North Yorkshire Moor Railway\u201d from Whitby to Pickering. We travel through the North Yorkshire National park, bordered by the Cleveland Hills to the North, the Hambleton Hills to the West, the Vale of Pickering to the South and the magnificent coast to the East, the beauty of the landscape, history and nature combine to create something truly special. The line itself passes through the beautifully restored stations of Grosmont and Goathland, famously used for the Harry Potter films and in the long running TV series Heartbeat. (On some occasions, this day may operate in reverse). Staithes and Port Mulgrave Walk A circular walk which takes in coastal views of Port Mulgrave before looping back through beautiful fields to the charming hamlet of Dalehouse. Your journey begins in Staithes, a welcoming fishing village bursting with character \u2013 it\u2019s a steep climb from the harbour to the top but the views are worth it. We take the Cleveland Way National Trail for incredible cliff side vistas, before an ascent through quiet lanes and woodland paths. Easy walk - Duration: 2.5 hours / Distance: 4 miles / Terrain: paths along the cliff side, fields and woodland."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["heritage", "views", "used", "yorkshire", "village", "mulgrave", "coast", "north", "port", "walk", "staithes", "discover", "whitby"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
