The previous day, President Trump had dined with Democratic leaders at the White House, and had impetuously agreed to a major policy reversal, granting provisional residency to undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. Coulter tweeted, \u201cAt this point, who doesn\u2019t want Trump impeached?\u201d She soon added, \u201cIf we\u2019re not getting a wall, I\u2019d prefer President Pence.\u201d Trump\u2019s swerve did the unthinkable\u2014uniting Coulter and liberal commentators. After Trump threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, Gail Collins, the Times columnist, praised Vice-President Mike Pence as someone who at least \u201cseems less likely to get the planet blown up.\u201d This summer, an opinion column by Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post, appeared under the headline \u201c \u2018President Pence\u2019 is Sounding Better and Better.\u201d Pence, who has dutifully stood by the President, mustering a devotional gaze rarely seen since the days of Nancy Reagan, serves as a daily reminder that the Constitution offers an alternative to Trump. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. The more Trump is mired in scandal, the more likely Pence\u2019s elevation to the Oval Office becomes, unless he ends up legally entangled as well. Pence\u2019s odds of becoming President are long but not prohibitive. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. After Lyndon Johnson decided to join the ticket with John F. Kennedy, he calculated his odds of ascension to be approximately one in four, and is said to have told Clare Boothe Luce, \u201cI\u2019m a gambling man, darling, and this is the only chance I\u2019ve got.\u201d If the job is a gamble for Pence, he himself is something of a gamble for the country. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. And, with all the infighting in the new Administration, few have focussed on Pence\u2019s power within the White House. Newt Gingrich told me recently that the three people with the most policy influence in the Administration are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and Pence. Gingrich went on, \u201cOthers have some influence, such as Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. He\u2019s in the national-security briefings.\u201d Moreover, and crucially, Pence is the only official in the White House who can\u2019t be fired. Pence, who declined requests for an interview, is also one of the few with whom Trump hasn\u2019t overtly feuded. \u201cThe President considers him one of his best decisions,\u201d Tony Fabrizio, a pollster for Trump, told me. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. \u201cYou end up with an odd pair of throwbacks from fifties casting,\u201d the former White House strategist Stephen Bannon joked, comparing them to Dean Martin, the bad boy of the Rat Pack, and \u201cthe dad on \u2018Leave It to Beaver.\u2019 \u201d Trump and Pence are misaligned politically, too. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counsellor, who became a pollster for Pence in 2009, describes him as \u201ca full-spectrum conservative\u201d on social, moral, economic, and defense issues. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. According to Bannon, Pence is \u201cthe outreach guy, the connective tissue\u201d between the Trump Administration and the most conservative wing of the Republican establishment. \u201cTrump\u2019s got the populist nationalists,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cBut Pence is the base. Without Pence, you don\u2019t win.\u201d Pence has taken care to appear extraordinarily loyal to Trump, so much so that Joel K. Goldstein, a historian and an expert on Vice-Presidents who teaches law at St. Louis University, refers to him as the \u201cSycophant-in-Chief.\u201d But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. He also has a close relationship with the conservative billionaire donors who have captured the Republican Party\u2019s agenda in recent years. During the 2016 campaign, Trump characterized the Republican Party\u2019s big spenders as \u201chighly sophisticated killers\u201d whose donations allowed them to control politicians. When he declared his candidacy, he claimed that, because of his real-estate fortune, he did not need support from \u201crich donors,\u201d and he denounced super pacs, their depositories of unlimited campaign contributions, as \u201ccorrupt.\u201d Pence\u2019s political career, though, has been sponsored at almost every turn by the donors whom Trump has assailed. Pence is the inside man of the conservative money machine. On Election Night, the dissonance between Trump\u2019s populist supporters and Pence\u2019s billionaire sponsors was quietly evident. When Trump gave his acceptance speech, in the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan, he vowed to serve \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country,\u201d and promised to \u201crebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, and hospitals.\u201d Upstairs, in a room reserved for Party \u00e9lites, several of the richest and most conservative donors, all of whom support drastic reductions in government spending, were celebrating. Doug Deason, a Texas businessman and a political donor, recalled to me, \u201cIt was amazing. In the V.I.P. reception area, there was an even more V.I.P. room, and I counted at least eight or nine billionaires.\u201d Deason\u2019s father, Darwin, founded a data-processing company, Affiliated Computer Services, and in 2010 he sold it to Xerox for $6.4 billion. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. \u201cMike and I are pretty good friends,\u201d Deason said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s really the contact to the big donors.\u201d Since the election, Deason has attended two dinners for wealthy backers at the Vice-Presidential residence. \u201cWell, there\u2019s never going to be a perfect time to start a family.\u201d Among the billionaires who gathered in the room at the Hilton, Deason recalled, were the financier Wilbur Ross, whom Trump later appointed his Secretary of Commerce; the corporate investor Carl Icahn, who became a top adviser to Trump but resigned eight months later, when allegations of financial impropriety were published by The New Yorker; Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil-and-gas company that has made billions of dollars through fracking; and David Koch, the richest resident of New York City. Koch\u2019s presence was especially unexpected. He and his brother Charles are libertarians who object to most government spending, including investments in infrastructure. They co-own virtually all of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the United States, and have long tapped their combined fortune\u2014currently ninety billion dollars\u2014to finance candidates, think tanks, pressure groups, and political operatives who support an anti-tax and anti-regulatory agenda, which dovetails with their financial interests. During the campaign, Trump said that Republican rivals who attended secretive donor summits sponsored by the Kochs were \u201cpuppets.\u201d The Kochs, along with several hundred allied donors, had amassed nearly nine hundred million dollars to spend on the Presidential election, but declined to support Trump\u2019s candidacy. At one point, Charles Koch described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as one between \u201ccancer or heart attack.\u201d Marc Short, the head of legislative affairs in the Trump White House, credits Pence for the Kochs\u2019 rapprochement with Trump. \u201cThe Kochs were very excited about the Vice-Presidential pick,\u201d Short told me. \u201cThere are areas where they differ from the Administration, but now there are many areas they\u2019re partnering with us on.\u201d Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, who has accused the Kochs of buying undue influence, particularly on environmental policy\u2014Koch Industries has a long history of pollution\u2014is less enthusiastic about their alliance with Pence. \u201cIf Pence were to become President for any reason, the government would be run by the Koch brothers\u2014period. He\u2019s been their tool for years,\u201d he said. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency. He told me, \u201cI\u2019m concerned he\u2019d be a President that the Kochs would own.\u201d", "This summer, I visited Pence\u2019s home town of Columbus, Indiana. Harry McCawley, a retired editor at the Republic, the local newspaper, told me, \u201cMike Pence wanted to be President practically since he popped out of the womb.\u201d Pence exudes a low-key humility, but, McCawley told me, \u201che\u2019s very ambitious, even calculating, about the steps he\u2019ll take toward that goal.\u201d McCawley, who died, of cancer, in September, knew the Pence family well, in part because the Vice-President\u2019s mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch, wrote a chatty column for the newspaper for several years (\u201cmemories blossom with arrival of spring\u201d). Eighty-four and energetic, Fritsch met me for coffee this summer, along with her eldest son, Gregory, who is in the antiques business in the Columbus area. Like the Vice-President, they are good-looking, with chiselled features, and have an unpretentious, amiable manner. They ribbed each other as they reminisced about the years when the Pences\u2019 six children lived with their parents in a series of modest houses. There was so little to do in the way of entertainment, Gregory Pence recalled, that \u201cwe sometimes got in the car with our parents on Friday nights and followed after the fire truck.\u201d All the boys had nicknames. \u201cMy name was General Harassment,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cMichael\u2019s was Bubbles, because he was chubby and funny.\u201d \u201cMichael\u2019s hilarious,\u201d his mother agreed. \u201cI attribute it to the Irish. We\u2019re faith-filled, and have a good sense of humor.\u201d The family identifies as Catholic, and Mike was an altar boy. \u201cReligion is the most important thing in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t take it seriously. I don\u2019t proselytize.\u201d Pence\u2019s maternal grandfather was from Ireland, but his paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence, Sr., came from a German family. Brief mentions of Edward in the press have described him as having worked in the Chicago stockyards, leaving the impression that he was poor. But Gregory told me that Edward was well off, with a seat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. \u201cGrandfather Pence was a very hard man,\u201d Gregory said. Edward refused to provide financial support when Gregory and Mike\u2019s father, Edward, Jr., went to college; an aunt loaned him the tuition, but he had to leave law school when he ran out of money. \u201cGrampa Pence was a gambler!\u201d Fritsch chimed in. \u201cHe played cards and went to Las Vegas.\u201d Fritsch went to secretarial school. With a laugh, she recalled that she met her first husband \u201cin a club\u2014in other words, a tavern.\u201d A Korean War veteran, Edward Pence, Jr., was in uniform that night. (He had won a Bronze Star, which the Vice-President keeps in his office.) In 1959, after leaving law school, he moved with Fritsch from Chicago to Columbus, where he sold fuel to gas stations, farms, and convenience stores. Shortly after their arrival, Michael Pence, the couple\u2019s third child, was born. Fritsch said of life in Indiana, \u201cI hated it. I always looked forward to going back to Chicago.\u201d But the family stayed, gradually moving into the upper middle class\u2014Edward became part owner of an oil distributorship\u2014and switching from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Fritsch had worshipped the Kennedys, but, she said, \u201cI guess I became a Republican because my husband was one. I was a Stepford wife.\u201d \u201cShe was like the Scarecrow in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 \u201d Gregory said at one point. \u201cYou see what I have to put up with?\u201d she shot back. Growing more serious, she explained that, until she went back to school, at sixty-five, to get a college degree in psychology, she \u201cdidn\u2019t have much self-esteem.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when she got her brain,\u201d Gregory said. Edward, Jr., like his father, was a tough disciplinarian. Gregory recalled, \u201cIf you lied to him, you\u2019d be taken upstairs, have a conversation, and then he\u2019d whack you with a belt.\u201d He expected his children to stand up whenever an adult entered the room. \u201cHe\u2019d grab you if you didn\u2019t,\u201d Gregory said. At dinner, the kids were forbidden to speak. While Gregory was in college, he was sleeping late on a visit home when his father pulled the covers off him and told him to get up for church. \u201cI said he couldn\u2019t tell me what to do anymore, because he was only paying half my college tuition,\u201d Gregory said. His father stopped paying his tuition altogether. \u201cHe was black and white,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cYou were never confused where you stood. My brother\u2019s a lot like him.\u201d Columbus, which has a population of forty-five thousand, was dominated by a major engine manufacturer, Cummins, and escaped the economic woes that afflicted many other parts of the region. But McCawley, the newspaper editor, told me that, while Pence was growing up, Columbus, \u201clike many Indiana communities, still had vestiges of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d The group had ruled the state\u2019s government in the twenties, and then gone underground. In Columbus, landlords refused to rent or sell homes to African-Americans until Cummins\u2019s owners demanded that they do so. Gregory Pence insisted that the town \u201cwas not racist,\u201d but contended that there had been anti-Catholic prejudice. Protestant kids had thrown stones at him, he recalled. \u201cWe were discriminated against,\u201d Pence\u2019s mother added. The Pence children attended St. Columba Catholic School through eighth grade. Mike discovered a talent for public speaking that made him a favorite with the nuns. In fifth grade, he won a local oratory contest, defeating kids several years older. \u201cWhen it came his turn, his voice just boomed out over the audience,\u201d his mother told the newspaper. \u201cHe just blew everybody away.\u201d In high school, Pence won third place in a national contest. When his mother recalled Mike as \u201ca good student,\u201d Gregory said, \u201cNot a fabulous one. I don\u2019t think he stood out. He was class president, but that wasn\u2019t cool.\u201d Nonetheless, by senior year, Mike was talking to classmates about becoming President of the United States. Mike Pence attended Hanover College, a liberal-arts school in southeast Indiana. On a visit home, he told his father that he was thinking of either joining the priesthood or attending law school. His father suggested he start with law; he could always join the priesthood later. Shortly thereafter, to his family\u2019s surprise, Pence became an evangelical Christian. His mother said that \u201ccollege gave him a different viewpoint.\u201d The story Pence tells is that he was in a fraternity, and when he admired another member\u2019s gold cross he was told, \u201cYou have to wear it in your heart before you wear it around your neck.\u201d Soon afterward, Pence has said, he attended a Christian music festival in Kentucky and \u201cgave my life to Jesus.\u201d His conversion was part of a larger movement. In 1979, during Pence\u2019s junior year in college, Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, to mobilize Christian voters as a political force. Pence voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980, but he soon joined the march of many Christians toward the Republican Party. The Moral Majority\u2019s co-founder, Paul Weyrich, a Midwestern Catholic, established numerous institutions of the conservative movement, including the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of far-right congressional members, which Pence eventually led. Weyrich condemned homosexuality, feminism, abortion, and government-imposed racial integration, and he partnered with some controversial figures, including Laszlo Pasztor, a former member of a pro-Nazi party in Hungary. When Weyrich died, in 2008, Pence praised him as a \u201cfriend and mentor\u201d and a \u201cfounding father of the modern conservative movement,\u201d from whom he had \u201cbenefitted immeasurably.\u201d While in law school, at Indiana University, Pence met and married Karen Batten, a schoolteacher whom he had noticed playing guitar in a church service. A friend at the time, Dan LeClerc, told me, \u201cHe was head over heels.\u201d Pence took her ice-skating; she made him taco salad for dinner. Soon, anticipating a proposal, she began carrying in her purse a gold cross with the inscription \u201cYes.\u201d Eight months after they began dating, he asked her to marry him, having buried a ring box in a loaf of bread that he\u2019d brought on a walk, ostensibly to feed ducks. They shellacked the loaf. Pence\u2019s friends have called Karen his \u201cprayer warrior.\u201d The couple became almost inseparable. One Christmas, she gave him an antique red phone, connected to a \u201chotline\u201d whose number only she knew. As the Washington Post reported, he kept it on his office desk long after the advent of cell phones. At home, they worked out on twin treadmills. And, as Rolling Stone reported in January, he referred to her in front of guests as \u201cMother.\u201d Pence\u2019s office has disputed the account, but a former Indiana Democratic Party official told me, \u201cI\u2019ve heard him call her Mother myself.\u201d Pence also began observing what\u2019s known as the Billy Graham rule, meaning that he never dined alone with another woman, or attended an event in mixed company where alcohol was served unless his wife was present. Critics have argued that this approach reduces women to sexual temptresses and precludes men from working with women on an equal basis. A Trump campaign official said that he found the Pences\u2019 dynamic \u201ca little creepy.\u201d But Kellyanne Conway defended him vigorously, telling me, \u201cI\u2019ve been a female top adviser of his for years, and never felt excluded or dismissed.\u201d She went on, \u201cMost wives would appreciate a loyal husband who puts them first. People are trying to bloody and muddy him, but talk about narrow-minded\u2014to judge his marriage!\u201d In 1987, a year after Pence graduated from law school, LeClerc, his old friend, was asked by a mutual acquaintance, \u201cGuess who\u2019s running for Congress?\u201d He drew a blank. Pence\u2019s decision, at the age of twenty-nine, to challenge a popular incumbent Democratic congressman surprised many people, including his father, Edward, who thought that it was silly, given that Mike was a young newlywed with no steady job. But after Mike entered the race Edward became his biggest booster, helping him raise money and put up lawn signs. Then, just a few weeks before the Republican primary, Edward, who was fifty-eight, had a heart attack and died. Mike won the primary, but the Democratic incumbent, Phil Sharp, was re\u00eblected. In 1990, Pence tried and failed again to unseat Sharp, waging a campaign that is remembered as especially nasty. One ad featured an actor dressed in Middle Eastern garb and sunglasses, who accused Sharp, falsely, of being a tool of Arab oil interests. But Pence\u2019s campaign foundered after the press revealed that he had used donations toward personal expenses, such as his mortgage and groceries. It wasn\u2019t technically illegal, but it violated the trust of his supporters and sullied his pious image. \u201cMike burned a lot of bridges,\u201d Gregory recalled. \u201cHe upset a lot of his backers. It was partly because of immaturity, but he really was kind of full of shit.\u201d The following year, Mike Pence wrote an essay, carried by local newspapers, titled \u201cConfessions of a Negative Campaigner,\u201d in which he said, \u201cA campaign ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate.\u201d He admitted to reporters that he had violated this standard, and said that he had no \u201cinterest in running for elected office in the foreseeable future,\u201d but added that if he ever did he would not wage a negative campaign. \u201cI think he realized he\u2019d besmirched himself,\u201d Sharp told me. \u201cHe comes across as Midwestern nice, but it was mean and shallow.\u201d Sharp, who after two more terms joined the faculty at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and is now semi-retired, remains unimpressed by Pence. \u201cThis is not a person, in my limited exposure, about whom I\u2019d ever say, \u2018Wow, he should be President!\u2019 \u201d Pence took a job at a law firm in Indianapolis, where he handled mainly small-claims and family cases, and started each day by praying with colleagues. An Indiana attorney recalled, \u201cHe was a big, jocular, friendly guy who would put his arm around you at the local pub. He probably weighed a hundred pounds more than today.\u201d There was a clear hierarchy in the Indianapolis legal world, and Pence was far from its top rungs, relying on referrals for work. \u201cThere were dozens of guys like that,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cBut the great American story is that a guy like Mike Pence is now Vice-President.\u201d Gregory said of his brother, \u201cLaw wasn\u2019t really his thing,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s completely unmotivated by money. I don\u2019t think he would think for one second about it, if it weren\u2019t for Karen.\u201d \u201cService is his motivation,\u201d Pence\u2019s mother said. \u201cAnd, of course, popularity,\u201d his brother added. \u201cHe had ambitions.\u201d", "Pence was thrown a lifeline in 1991, when he was offered a job as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a tiny new think tank that promoted free-market policies. Pence joked that some people called the foundation \u201can old-folks home for unsuccessful candidates,\u201d but it gave him a steady paycheck and valuable exposure to the burgeoning universe of business-funded conservative nonprofit groups. The foundation was part of the State Policy Network, a national web of organizations that had been launched at Ronald Reagan\u2019s suggestion. It was designed to replicate at a more local level the Heritage Foundation\u2019s successful promotion of conservative policies. One of the State Policy Network\u2019s founders, Thomas Roe, a construction magnate with strong anti-union views, was said to have told a Heritage board member, \u201cYou capture the Soviet Union\u2014I\u2019m going to capture the states.\u201d In a 2008 speech, Pence described himself as \u201cpart of what we called the seed corn Heritage Foundation was spreading around the country in the state think-tank movement.\u201d It isn\u2019t fully clear whose money was behind the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, because think tanks, as nonprofits, don\u2019t have to disclose their donors. But the early funders of the Heritage Foundation included some Fortune 500 companies, in fields such as oil, chemicals, and tobacco, that opposed health, safety, and environmental regulations. Cecil Bohanon, one of two adjunct scholars at Pence\u2019s think tank, had a history of financial ties to tobacco-company front groups, and in 2000 Pence echoed industry talking points in an essay that argued, \u201cSmoking doesn\u2019t kill. In fact, two out of every three smokers doesn\u2019t die from a smoking-related illness.\u201d A greater \u201cscourge\u201d than cigarettes, he argued, was \u201cbig government disguised as do-gooder, healthcare rhetoric.\u201d Bohanon, who still writes for the think tank\u2019s publication, also has ties to the Kochs. Last year, John Hardin, the head of university relations for the Charles Koch Foundation, told an Indiana newspaper that the Kochs had been funding Bohanon\u2019s work as a professor of free-market economics at Ball State University \u201cfor years.\u201d Even as Pence argued for less government interference in business, he pushed for policies that intruded on people\u2019s private lives. In the early nineties, he joined the board of the Indiana Family Institute, a far-right group that supported the criminalization of abortion and campaigned against equal rights for homosexuals. And, while Pence ran the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, it published an essay arguing that unmarried women should be denied access to birth control. \u201cWhat these people are really after is contraceptives,\u201d Vi Simpson, the former Democratic minority leader of the Indiana State Senate, told me. In 2012, after serving twenty-eight years in the legislature, she ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with the gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg, who lost the election to Pence. Simpson believes that Pence wants to reverse women\u2019s economic and political advances. \u201cHe\u2019s on a mission,\u201d she said. Pence\u2019s true gift was not as a thinker but as a talker. In 1992, he became a host on conservative talk radio, which had been booming since the F.C.C., in 1987, repealed the Fairness Doctrine and stopped requiring broadcasters to provide all sides of controversial issues. At a time when bombastic, angry voices proliferated, Pence was different. Like Reagan, who had become his political hero, he could present even extreme positions in genial, nonthreatening terms. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative, but I\u2019m not mad about it,\u201d he liked to say. He welcomed guests of all political stripes, and called himself \u201cRush Limbaugh on decaf.\u201d \u201cHis radio career gave him great statewide name recognition,\u201d Jeff Smulyan, the C.E.O. of Emmis Communications, on whose radio stations Pence\u2019s program aired, said. \u201cHe\u2019s likable, and a great self-promoter.\u201d Smulyan, a Democrat, added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how he\u2019d fare in a detailed policy debate, but Mike knows what Mike believes.\u201d In 1994, Pence was on eighteen Emmis stations, five days a week. By then, he\u2019d lost weight and had three children; he\u2019d also amassed a Rolodex full of conservative connections and established a national network of wealthy funders. In 2000, when a Republican congressman in northern Indiana vacated his seat, Pence ran as the Party favorite, on a platform that included a promise to oppose \u201cany effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws.\u201d He won, by a twelve-point margin.", "Once Pence got to Washington, Conway said, his background \u201cin the think-tank-slash-media axis really equipped him to defend and explain an argument in a full-throated way.\u201d Pence was in demand on the conservative speaking circuit, and frequently appeared on Sunday talk shows. \u201cHe was invited to Heritage, gun owners\u2019 groups, property-rights groups, pro-life groups, and pro-Israel groups,\u201d Conway recalled. \u201cPeople started to see an authentic, affable conservative who was not in a bad mood about it.\u201d Michael Leppert, a Democratic lobbyist in Indiana, saw Pence differently. \u201cHis politics were always way outside the mainstream,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cHe just does it with a smile on his face instead of a snarl.\u201d Pence served twelve years in Congress, but never authored a single successful bill. His sights, according to Leppert, were always \u201con the national ticket.\u201d He gained attention by challenging his own party\u2019s leaders, both in Congress and in the George W. Bush Administration, from the right. He broke with the vast majority of his Republican peers by opposing Bush\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs, along with the No Child Left Behind initiative and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the government\u2019s emergency bailout of banks. Conway calls him \u201ca rebel with a cause.\u201d In 2004, the House\u2019s most conservative members elected him to head their caucus, the Republican Study Committee. Pence joked that the group was so alien to the Party\u2019s mainstream that running it was like leading a \u201cStar Trek\u201d convention. \u201cHe was as far right as you could go without falling off the earth,\u201d Mike Lofgren, a former Republican congressional staff member, who has become a Trump critic, told me. \u201cBut he never really put a foot wrong politically. Beneath the Bible-thumping earnestness was a calculating and ambitious pol.\u201d In 2006, Pence boldly challenged the House Minority Leader at the time, John Boehner, a more centrist Republican from Ohio, for his post. Pence got wiped out, but in 2008 Boehner\u2014perhaps trying to contain Pence\u2019s ambition\u2014asked him to serve as the Republican Conference chair, the Party\u2019s third-highest-ranking post in the House. The chair presides over weekly meetings in which Republican House members discuss policy and legislative goals. Pence used the platform to set the Party\u2019s message on a rightward course, raise money, and raise his profile. After Barack Obama was elected President, Pence became an early voice of the Tea Party movement, which opposed taxes and government spending with an angry edge. Pence\u2019s tone grew more militant, too. In 2011, he made the evening news by threatening to shut down the federal government unless it defunded Planned Parenthood. Some Hoosiers were unnerved to see footage of Pence standing amid rowdy protesters at a Tea Party rally and yelling, \u201cShut it down!\u201d His radicalism, however, only boosted his national profile. Pence became best known for fiercely opposing abortion. He backed \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation that would ban it under all circumstances, including rape and incest, unless a woman\u2019s life was at stake. He sponsored an unsuccessful amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have made it legal for government-funded hospitals to turn away a dying woman who needed an abortion. (Later, as governor of Indiana, he signed a bill barring women from aborting a physically abnormal fetus; the bill also required fetal burial or cremation, including after a miscarriage. A federal judge recently found the law unconstitutional.) Pence\u2019s close relationship with dozens of conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs\u2019 top political organization, was crucial to his rise. A key link to these groups was provided by Marc Short, the current White House official, who in 2008 became Pence\u2019s chief of staff at the Republican Conference. Short had grown up in moneyed conservative circles in Virginia, where his father had helped finance the growth of the Republican Party, and he had run a group for conservative students, Young America\u2019s Foundation, and spent several years as a Republican Senate aide before joining Pence\u2019s staff. His wife, as it happened, worked for the Charles Koch Foundation, and he admired the brothers\u2019 anti-government ideology. A former White House colleague described Short to me as \u201ca pod person\u201d who \u201creally delivered Pence to the Kochs.\u201d In June, 2009, Short brokered Pence\u2019s first invitation to address a Koch \u201cseminar,\u201d as the brothers call their secretive semi-annual fund-raising sessions for top conservative donors. The theme of the gathering, in Aspen, Colorado, was \u201cUnderstanding and Addressing Threats to American Free Enterprise and Prosperity.\u201d Pence\u2019s speech was a hit. Short told me, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone who can take a complex subject and distill it in a heartbeat like he can.\u201d He\u2019d also never seen \u201canyone who is as dedicated a public servant, and lives their faith as Mike does.\u201d Short, who is a devout Christian, said, \u201cPeople often profess faith that\u2019s not lived out, but with him it\u2019s lived out each and every day. It guides him. It\u2019s his core.\u201d \u201cNo, Barry, I want you to want to help bury the evidence.\u201d The Kochs, who are not religious, may have been focussed more on pocketbook issues than on Pence\u2019s faith. According to Scott Peterson, the executive director of the Checks & Balances Project, a watchdog group that monitors attempts to influence environmental policy, Pence was invited to the Koch seminar only after he did the brothers a major political favor. By the spring of 2009, Koch Industries, like other fossil-fuel companies, felt threatened by growing support in Congress for curbing carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. Americans for Prosperity devised a \u201cNo Climate Tax\u201d pledge for candidates to sign, promising not to spend any government funds on limiting carbon pollution. At first, the campaign languished, attracting only fourteen signatures. The House, meanwhile, was moving toward passage of a \u201ccap and trade\u201d bill, which would charge companies for carbon pollution. If the bill were enacted, the costs could be catastrophic to Koch Industries, which releases some twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year, and owns millions of acres of untapped oil reserves in Canada, plus coal-fired power plants and oil refineries. Pence, who had called global warming \u201ca myth\u201d created by environmentalists in their \u201clatest Chicken Little attempt to raise taxes,\u201d took up the Kochs\u2019 cause. He not only signed their pledge but urged others to do so as well. He gave speeches denouncing the cap-and-trade bill\u2014which passed the House but got held up in the Senate\u2014as a \u201cdeclaration of war on the Midwest.\u201d His language echoed that of the Koch groups. Americans for Prosperity called the bill \u201cthe largest excise tax in history,\u201d and Pence called it \u201cthe largest tax increase in American history.\u201d (Neither statement was true.) He used a map created by the Heritage Foundation, which the Kochs supported, to make his case, and he urged House Republicans to hold \u201cenergy summits\u201d opposing the legislation in their districts, sending them home over the summer recess with kits to bolster their presentations. According to the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, after Pence began promoting the Kochs\u2019 pledge the number of signatories in the House soared, reaching a hundred and fifty-six. James Valvo, the policy director for Americans for Prosperity, who spearheaded the pledge, told the Reporting Workshop that support from Pence and other Republicans helped \u201ca scrappy outlier\u201d become \u201cthe established position.\u201d The cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate. Short said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t recall the Kochs ever asking for help on the issue,\u201d adding, \u201cThe Republican Conference believed it was a winning issue because of the impact that the bill would have had on jobs.\u201d In any event, the pledge marked a pivotal turn in the climate-change debate, cementing Republican opposition to addressing the environmental crisis. Peterson said that the Checks & Balances Project hadn\u2019t detected \u201cmuch money going from the Kochs to Pence before he promoted the \u2018No Climate Tax\u2019 pledge.\u201d Afterward, \u201che was the Kochs\u2019 guy, and they\u2019ve been showering him with money ever since.\u201d Peterson went on, \u201cHe could see a pathway to the Presidency with them behind him.\u201d Indeed, by 2011 Pence had reportedly become Charles Koch\u2019s favorite potential candidate for President in 2012. Andrew Downs, a political scientist who directs the nonpartisan Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics, in Fort Wayne, said, \u201cPeople thought Pence was gearing up for a Presidential run.\u201d Downs pointed out that when Pence was in Congress \u201che probably had a shot at becoming Speaker of the House.\u201d Downs continued, \u201cInstead, he spoke at a lot of engagements with a national focus, and visited places like Iowa and New Hampshire. Running for President isn\u2019t an idea that just occurred to Mike Pence when he joined the ticket in 2016. It goes back a long way.\u201d But the House of Representatives is a tough platform from which to get elected President. And so, in 2012, after mulling over his national prospects, Pence ran instead for governor of Indiana. \u201cThe conventional wisdom is that he ran for governor so he could check that box, get some executive experience, and then run for President,\u201d Downs said. Pence won the governor\u2019s race, but with only forty-nine per cent of the vote. \u201cHe was scary to the center,\u201d Bill Oesterle, a co-founder of Angie\u2019s List, an Indiana company that collates user reviews of local contractors, said. Oesterle, a Republican, contributed a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to Pence\u2019s campaign. David Koch contributed two hundred thousand dollars. Pence\u2019s commitment to the Kochs was now ironclad. Short, his former chief of staff, had become a top operative for the Kochs, earning upward of a million dollars a year as president of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the brothers\u2019 Virginia-based membership group for big conservative donors. It served as a dark-money bank, enabling donors to stay anonymous while distributing funds to favored campaigns and political organizations. (During the past decade, the group has pooled an estimated billion and a half dollars in contributions.) The Kochs\u2019 national political network, which had offices in nearly every state, became the most powerful and best-financed private political machine in the country. At least four other former Pence staffers followed Short\u2019s lead and joined the Koch network, including Emily Seidel, who joined Freedom Partners, and Matt Lloyd, who became a Koch Industries spokesman. In 2014, a Republican strategist told Politico that \u201cthe whole Koch operation\u201d had become \u201cthe shadow headquarters of Pence for President.\u201d", "Pence\u2019s tenure as governor nearly destroyed his political career. He had promised Oesterle and other members of the state\u2019s Republican business establishment that he would continue in the path of his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, a well-liked fiscal conservative who had called for a \u201ctruce\u201d on divisive social issues. \u201cPence was very accommodating,\u201d Oesterle said. But after he was elected he began taking controversial far-right stands that, critics believed, were geared more toward building his national profile than toward serving Indiana voters. At first, Pence highlighted fiscal conservatism. In 2013, he proposed cutting the state income tax. An internal report by Americans for Prosperity described the proposal as an example of the Kochs\u2019 \u201cmodel states\u201d program \u201cin action.\u201d Indiana Republicans, who had majorities in both legislative chambers, initially balked at the tax cut, deeming it irresponsible. But Americans for Prosperity acted as a force multiplier for Pence, much as it is now promising to do for Trump\u2019s proposed federal tax cuts. The group mounted an expensive campaign that included fifty rallies, two six-figure television-ad blitzes, and phone-bank calls and door-to-door advocacy in fifty-three of Indiana\u2019s ninety-two counties. Eventually, the legislature went along with what Pence often describes as \u201cthe largest income-tax cut in the state\u2019s history,\u201d even though Indiana already had one of the lowest income taxes in the country, and had cut it only once before. Trump has recently described Pence\u2019s record as a template for the White House\u2019s tax plan, saying, \u201cIndiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes.\u201d But, in the view of Andrew Downs, the Indiana political scientist, \u201cthe tax cuts were fairly meaningless.\u201d Residents earning fifty thousand dollars a year received a tax cut of about $3.50 per month. Pence claimed that the cut stimulated the economy, but John Zody, the chairman of the state\u2019s Democratic Party, told me, \u201cOur per-capita income is thirty-eighth in the nation, and not climbing.\u201d The state recently had to increase its gas tax by ten cents per gallon, to repair its crumbling infrastructure. In a few surprising instances, Pence veered from conservative orthodoxy. In 2014, he broke with many other Republican governors and agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana. He declared that his proposal was \u201cthe kind of health-care reform that puts working Hoosiers in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d He was no fan of Obamacare: when it passed, he likened the blow to 9/11. Nevertheless, Pence negotiated with the Obama Administration and established waivers that made the expansion acceptable to him. Among other things, all Indiana residents were required to demonstrate \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d by paying something toward the cost of their medical services. Critics argued that such measures were needlessly punitive toward poor residents. Americans for Prosperity, which objects to any form of government health care, gently reproached Pence for \u201cmeeting Washington\u2019s demands.\u201d But the Medicaid-expansion plan was, and remains, popular in the state. After this apostasy, Pence tilted back toward the right. At the last minute, he killed an application for an eighty-million-dollar federal grant to start a statewide preschool program. Education officials in Pence\u2019s own administration favored the grant, but conservative opponents of secular public education had complained. When reporters asked Pence about his decision, he said only that the federal government had attached \u201ctoo many strings.\u201d But, as Matthew Tully, a columnist at the Indianapolis Star, wrote, \u201che could not name one.\u201d Eventually, after widespread criticism, Pence reapplied for the grant. Tully concluded that Pence had a \u201cfatal flaw\u201d\u2014he was \u201ctoo political and ideological\u201d to be a good governor. \u201cHis focus was on the next step up, not the job at hand,\u201d Tully wrote. Political handicappers noticed that Pence was spending a lot of time taking trips to states with important Presidential primaries and mingling with big out-of-state donors. In the summer of 2014, Pence spoke at an Americans for Prosperity summit in Dallas. At the event, he stood by Short\u2019s side and declared himself \u201cgrateful to have enjoyed\u201d David Koch\u2019s support. That fall, Pence reached out to Nick Ayers, a young, sharp-elbowed political consultant, to see if he would help him in a 2016 Presidential run. Nothing came of it, but Pence clearly had White House ambitions. In the spring of 2015, Pence signed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he presented as innocuous. \u201cHe said it protected religious freedom, and who\u2019s against that?\u201d Oesterle recalled. But then a photograph of the closed signing session surfaced. It showed Pence surrounded by monks and nuns, along with three of the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state. The image went viral. Indiana residents began examining the law more closely, and discovered that it essentially legalized discrimination against homosexuals by businesses in the state. \u201cThe No. 1 challenge we face in Indiana is the ability to attract and retain talented people,\u201d Oesterle said. \u201cIf the state is seen as bigoted to certain members of the community, it makes the job monumentally harder.\u201d The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Oesterle said, \u201cwas not an issue of Pence\u2019s creation\u201d\u2014it had \u201cgurgled out\u201d of the far-right fringe of the Indiana legislature. But, he added, \u201cthere was a lack of leadership.\u201d In his view, Pence should have prevented it and other extreme bills from moving forward. \u201cYou can see it happening in Washington now,\u201d Oesterle said. \u201cHe\u2019s not that effective a leader, or administrator. Extremists grabbed the initiative.\u201d The outcry over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enormous. Gay-rights groups condemned the bill and urged boycotts of the state. Pete Buttigieg, the young gay mayor of South Bend, who is a rising figure in the Democratic Party, told me that he tried to talk to Pence about the legislation, which he felt would cause major economic damage to Indiana. \u201cBut he got this look in his eye,\u201d Buttigieg recalled. \u201cHe just inhabits a different reality. It\u2019s very difficult for him to lay aside the social agenda. He\u2019s a zealot.\u201d In an effort to quell criticism, Pence consented, against the advice of his staff, to be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday-morning show on ABC. Stephanopoulos asked him five times if it was now legal in Indiana for businesses to discriminate against homosexuals, and each time Pence was evasive. Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. \u201cWhat killed him was his unwillingness to take a clear position,\u201d Oesterle said. \u201cYou saw the conflict between his ideology and his ambition. If he\u2019d just said, \u2018Look, I think people should have the right to fire gay people,\u2019 he would have been labelled a rigid ideologue, but he wouldn\u2019t have been mocked.\u201d Smulyan, the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. The hashtag #BoycottIndiana appeared on Twitter\u2019s list of trending topics, and remained there for days. Alarmed business executives from many of the state\u2019s most prominent companies, including Cummins, Eli Lilly, Salesforce, and Anthem, joined civic leaders in expressing disapproval. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. A headline in the Star, published the Tuesday after the Stephanopoulos interview, demanded, \u201cfix this now.\u201d Within days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. But he clearly had not anticipated the outrage he\u2019d triggered, and then he had tried to save his career at the expense of his professed principles. Steve Deace, an influential conservative radio host, told me that Pence\u2019s reversal was \u201calmost the worst conservative betrayal I\u2019ve witnessed in my career.\u201d He added, \u201cHe had no chance at national office after that, other than getting on the Trump ticket.\u201d Similarly, Michael Maurer, the owner of the Indianapolis Business Journal, who is a Republican but not a hard-line social conservative, said, \u201cIt just exploded in his face. His polls were terrible. I bet he\u2019d never get elected again in Indiana. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. We\u2019re still reeling!\u201d Pence loyalists rushed in to help. Matt Lloyd, Pence\u2019s former congressional staffer, left his communications job with Koch Industries to work with him in Indiana. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. But Pence\u2019s mistake could not be airbrushed away. Lawn signs saying \u201cFire Pence!\u201d began appearing across the state. \u201cYou were overheard saying you\u2019d kill for a good tomato.\u201d \u201cHis tenure in Indiana was characterized by a lot of missteps,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cHe was always decent to me, but over all there was a sense that every few months something got bungled. He\u2019s definitely not the mastermind behind the curtain that some people suspect.\u201d", "In 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. In a place like Scott County, Clere said, \u201ctypically you\u2019d have no cases, or maybe one a year.\u201d Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. (Pence\u2019s campaign against Planned Parenthood had contributed to the closure of five clinics in the region; none had performed abortions, but all had offered H.I.V. testing.) That same year, the state health commissioner called Indiana\u2019s H.I.V. outbreak a public-health emergency. Clere came of age during the AIDS crisis, and had read Randy Shilts\u2019s best-selling account, \u201cAnd the Band Played On.\u201d He tried to get the legislature to study the possibility of legalizing a syringe exchange, which he felt \u201cwas a matter of life and death,\u201d and could \u201csave lives quickly and inexpensively.\u201d But conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. \u201cWith Pence, you need to look at the framework, which is abstinence,\u201d Clere said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as with giving teen-agers condoms. Conservatives think it promotes the behavior, even though it\u2019s a scientifically proven harm-reduction strategy.\u201d In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. Clere told me that he spent \u201cevery last dime of my political capital\u201d to get the bill through. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. \u201cI commend Representative Clere for the efforts to help the state deal with this,\u201d Kevin Burke, the health officer in neighboring Clark County, told me. \u201cBut he paid a price for it.\u201d Clere remains bitter about Pence. \u201cIt was all part of his pattern of political expediency,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was stridently against it until it became politically expedient to support it.\u201d Clere, a Christian who opposes abortion, told me that he now finds Pence\u2019s piety hypocritical. \u201cHe says he\u2019s \u2018pro-life,\u2019 \u201d Clere said. \u201cBut people were dying.\u201d When Clere was asked whom he would rather have as President\u2014Trump or Pence\u2014he replied, \u201cI\u2019d take Trump every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.\u201d", "Pence likes to say of himself, \u201cI am a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\u201d But Clere is not alone in questioning Pence\u2019s political purity. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. In the hope of reversing Pence\u2019s ban, Joseph Tobin, the bishop of Indianapolis, requested a meeting. Tobin, who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Tobin is revered in the Catholic community of Indiana in which Pence grew up. \u201cI really think he thought it over,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cThere was some anguish.\u201d But in the end Pence told him, \u201cI need to protect the people of the state.\u201d \u201cI respect that,\u201d Tobin replied. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a threat.\u201d Pence didn\u2019t change his mind. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. Eventually, federal courts struck down Pence\u2019s executive order as discriminatory. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. After a pause, he quietly said, \u201cNo.\u201d Pence has also been criticized for his treatment of Keith Cooper, a former resident of Elkhart, Indiana, who spent nine years in prison for an armed robbery that he didn\u2019t commit. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do a thing to help me,\u201d Cooper told me. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. It was the first time in Indiana that a pardon was granted on the basis of innocence, rather than clemency. \u201cIt was all about Pence\u2019s political career,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs a Christian, he\u2019s a hypocrite. He wouldn\u2019t see me or speak with me. God doesn\u2019t turn his back on the truth, but Pence just walked away from the truth. I couldn\u2019t move forward in life. I was stuck in a dead-end job.\u201d Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. \u201cI forgive them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stood up for me.\u201d He went on, \u201cI forgive the prosecutor. He wrote a letter. And the parole board? They saw that justice happened. But I don\u2019t forgive Mike Pence, and never will. He talks all this God stuff, but he\u2019s biased. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. He didn\u2019t want to be the first white man in Indiana to pardon an innocent black man.\u201d A spokesman for Pence, who declined to be quoted, said Pence believed that Cooper needed to go back to court and face a retrial, instead of seeking a pardon.", "Pence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. In the spring of 2016, polls showed the two in a dead heat. The national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. Frustrated, Short quit his job at Freedom Partners and signed on to Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign. The Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. The brain trust behind Trump\u2019s Indiana campaign included people whose public images were very different from Pence\u2019s. Among them were Roderick Ratcliff, the C.E.O. of Centaur Gaming, the state\u2019s largest gaming-and-racetrack business, and Steve Hilbert, a flamboyant entrepreneur who had been a business partner of Trump\u2019s. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. He is currently married to his sixth wife, and has denied reports that they met when she popped out of a cake, topless, at his stepson\u2019s bachelor party. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. In 2013, when Hilbert needed cash, Trump bought Hilbert\u2019s Caribbean estate, and Hilbert and Melania Trump made a deal to sell skin-care products. Despite Pence\u2019s straitlaced reputation, he had closer ties with these figures than most people knew. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. The state\u2019s gaming companies, including Centaur, routed donations to \u201csoft money\u201d groups like the Republican Governors Association, which then transferred the money to Pence and other candidates. Pence, meanwhile, used executive orders to quietly grant several of the gambling industry\u2019s wishes, such as allowing riverboat casinos to expand onshore. In 2016, the largest donor to Pence\u2019s gubernatorial campaign was the Republican Governors Association, and some of its major donors were casino companies. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. Nearly all this cash, and much more, was divided between just two gubernatorial races that year, one of which was Indiana\u2019s. That spring, David Koch also invited Pence to be a featured guest at a fund-raiser at his Palm Beach mansion, attended by about seventy of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest donors. Trump handily won the Indiana primary. Pence, who had tepidly endorsed Ted Cruz, switched to Trump. Pence\u2019s history with Trump, however, was strained. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Trump brought up some gossip\u2014the wife of Mitch Daniels, the outgoing governor of Indiana, had reportedly left him for another man, then reunited with her husband. According to the Times, Trump announced that he\u2019d never take back a wife who had been unfaithful. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Trump gave Pence a small contribution, but the coarse New York billionaire and the prim Indiana evangelical appeared to be on different wavelengths. Nevertheless, in 2016, political insiders in Indiana began hearing that Pence would welcome a spot on the Trump ticket. \u201cThere was no doubt he\u2019d say yes,\u201d Tony Samuel, the vice-chair of the Trump campaign in the state, who was a lobbyist for Centaur and other companies, told me. Paul Manafort, who was Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at that point, arranged for Trump to meet Pence, and urged Trump to pick him. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Kellyanne Conway, who had done polling work for the Kochs, pushed for Pence, too, as did Stephen Bannon, although private e-mails recently obtained by BuzzFeed indicate that he considered the choice a Faustian bargain\u2014\u201can unfortunate necessity.\u201d Still, Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. In 2004, the oil firm that Pence\u2019s father had partly owned had filed for bankruptcy. Mike Pence\u2019s shares of the company\u2019s stock, which he had valued at up to a quarter of a million dollars, became worthless. In 2016, according to a campaign-finance disclosure form, Pence had one bank account, which held less than fifteen thousand dollars. But in July Pence found a way to please Trump when he played golf with him at Trump\u2019s club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Recognizing that Trump was susceptible to flattery, he told the media that Trump \u201cbeat me like a drum.\u201d \u201cPlan B is firing whoever came up with Plan A.\u201d Yet, in a phone conversation that I had with Trump during this period, he told me that he was torn about the choice. He noted repeatedly that Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, had been \u201cloyal\u201d to him. When I asked Trump if he shared Pence\u2019s deeply conservative social views, he became uncharacteristically silent. Trump came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. Afterward, the Trump campaign informed him that the choice was down to him or Pence, so he needed to \u201cget ready.\u201d The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. A tire on Trump\u2019s plane developed a flat, so he and his son Eric, who had accompanied him, decided to stay the night. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. (Samuel, who was at the restaurant, told me that Trump tipped the chef a couple hundred dollars.) At dawn on July 13th, Ivanka and Don, Jr., flew to Indianapolis to join their father for breakfast with the Pences at the governor\u2019s mansion. The Times soon reported that Trump had asked Pence if he would accept the job, and that Pence had responded, \u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d But the next night, according to someone familiar with the details, Trump called Christie and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a question for you. Are you ready?\u201d \u201cReady for what?\u201d Christie responded. \u201cReady to do this with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAre you offering?\u201d Christie said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you\u2014but you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re ready,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m as tough as they come,\u201d Christie said. \u201cO.K.,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m making the decision tomorrow. Stay by your phone.\u201d But Christie was left hanging for the next three days. He suspected that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had intervened and turned Trump against him, because years earlier, as a U.S. Attorney, he had prosecuted Kushner\u2019s father for tax fraud and other crimes. Conway told me that this theory was wrong, but acknowledged, \u201cIt truly was a tie\u2014almost a jump ball.\u201d Hoping to break the tie, Christie\u2019s detractors made the case that he was politically toxic because of the Bridgegate scandal, in which officials had caused traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in an act of reprisal against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey. Trump began leaning toward Pence. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Trump was pushed into it,\u201d a top Trump campaign aide told me. \u201cHe was led into it. Pence was made the most palatable choice by those around him.\u201d Before Pence\u2019s trip to Bedminster, he had asked his brother Gregory to meet him at a Burger King. \u201cHe said, \u2018Donald Trump wants to talk to me,\u2019 \u201d Gregory recalled. They both knew what it was about. \u201cI told him, \u2018You have to go, you have no choice,\u2019 \u201d Gregory said. As he saw it, his brother also had no choice about saying yes, if picked: \u201cWhen your party\u2019s nominee asks you to be the running mate, you have to do it.\u201d But it was a gamble. As Gregory put it to me, \u201cIf he lost, he had no money, and he had three kids in college. He took out student loans for the kids. He\u2019s got a retirement account, but I was afraid he\u2019d run out of money in just a couple of weeks. He\u2019d have to get a job. He was rolling the dice.\u201d Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. \u201cThe one thing you could count on with Pence was interpersonal decency, which made it strange that he joined the Trump ticket, the most indecent ticket any party\u2019s ever put together,\u201d Pete Buttigieg said. \u201cBut, really, he had nowhere else to go. His chances of getting re\u00eblected were fifty-fifty at best.\u201d By July 14th, Trump\u2019s aides had leaked that he was about to pick Pence, who had flown to New York for the announcement. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. The next morning, Trump called Christie and said, \u201cThey\u2019re telling me I have to pick him. It\u2019s central casting. He looks like a Vice-President.\u201d A few hours later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate. Several days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just perfect?\u201d Trump asked Gingrich. \u201cStraight from central casting.\u201d", "The awkwardness between Pence and Trump didn\u2019t entirely dissipate. When the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, revealing Trump\u2019s boast about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d Karen Pence was horrified. According to a former campaign aide, Pence refused to take Trump\u2019s calls and sent him a letter saying that he and Karen, as Christians, were deeply offended by his actions and needed to make an \u201cassessment\u201d about whether to remain with the campaign. They urged Trump to pray. When Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had \u201chuge problems\u201d with his behavior. But in public Pence was forgiving, saying, \u201cI am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\u201d (A Pence spokesman has denied that there was any friction over the incident.) Pence exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. \u201cHe did an amazing job,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cLots of conservative groups had questions about Trump. He answered those questions.\u201d The Kochs were delighted that one of their favorite politicians had joined the ticket, although, because of Trump\u2019s stance against wealthy donors, Pence and the Kochs agreed to cancel a speech that he had been scheduled to give at their donor summit that August. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. Some billionaires in the Kochs\u2019 donor network\u2014such as the hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, who has also financed Bannon\u2019s ventures\u2014began backing Trump. The Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. Trump had promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington, but he had no experience governing, and few political contacts. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. Christie\u2019s team had been quietly gathering r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and making plans for months, but Pence\u2019s team threw out the research, dumping thirty binders of material into the trash. \u201cDonald Trump ran against the establishment, but there was a vacuum,\u201d a member of the earlier transition team said. \u201cMovement conservatives jumped in. There was strong think-tank participation from Heritage and others who saw the opportunity.\u201d Trump began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt, in turn, placed Patrick Traylor, a lawyer for Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies, in charge of the E.P.A.\u2019s enforcement of key anti-pollution laws. As the Times has reported, a document called \u201cA Roadmap to Repeal,\u201d written by Koch operatives, has guided the E.P.A.\u2019s reversal of Obama Administration clean-air and climate regulations. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. Betsy DeVos, a billionaire heiress, who had been a major member of the Kochs\u2019 donor network and a supporter of Pence, was named Secretary of Education. The new director of the C.I.A. was Mike Pompeo, the congressman who represented Charles Koch\u2019s district, in Wichita, Kansas; before Pompeo ran for office, the Kochs had invested in his aerospace business. Pompeo, the former transition-team member said, \u201cwasn\u2019t even on Trump\u2019s radar, but he was brought in to meet him and got appointed, like, the next day.\u201d A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. The pattern continued among lower-level political appointees, including in Pence\u2019s office, which was stocked with Koch alumni. Pence reportedly consulted with Charles Koch before hiring his speechwriter, Stephen Ford, who previously worked at Freedom Partners. Senator Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, believes that the Kochs \u201cwill stick one hundred of their own people into the government\u2014and Trump will never notice.\u201d As a result, he said, \u201cthe signs of a rapprochement are everywhere.\u201d Whitehouse continued, \u201cOne by one, all the things that Trump campaigned on that annoyed the Koch brothers are being thrown overboard. And one by one the Koch brothers\u2019 priorities are moving up the list.\u201d Trump\u2019s populist, nationalist agenda has largely been replaced by the agenda of the corporate right. Trump has made little effort at infrastructure reform, and he abandoned his support for a \u201cborder-adjustment tax\u201d after the Koch network spent months campaigning against it, and after Pence and Short discussed it privately with Charles Koch at a meeting in Colorado Springs this summer. Bannon\u2019s proposal to create a higher tax bracket for citizens earning upward of five million dollars was dropped. The Kochs enthusiastically support the White House\u2019s proposed tax-cut package, which, according to most nonpartisan analyses, will disproportionately benefit the super-rich. (The proposed elimination of the estate tax alone would give the Koch brothers\u2019 heirs a windfall of billions of dollars.) \u201cUgh, we get it\u2014you\u2019re in love.\u201d Americans for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. \u201cThey\u2019re aligned on tax reform,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cThe Kochs are a hundred per cent with you, so long as it means cutting taxes for the Kochs. Anything that will help the middle-class people? Forget it.\u201d", "Another consequence of Trump\u2019s choice for Vice-President may be the widening federal investigation into possible connections between his campaign and the Russian government. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. Flynn, whom Obama had fired as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was not on any of the original transition team\u2019s long lists for government appointments. Christie considered him too risky. On November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. \u201cGentlemen, can I help you?\u201d Christie asked. Ivanka Trump, who was a member of the transition team\u2019s executive council, announced that she had invited them. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. Praising Flynn\u2019s \u201camazing loyalty to my father,\u201d she turned to him and asked, \u201cGeneral, what job do you want?\u201d A participant at the meeting said, \u201cIt was like Princess Ivanka had laid the sword on Flynn\u2019s shoulders and said, \u2018Rise and go forth.\u2019 \u201d (A source close to Ivanka didn\u2019t deny the account, but said that it exaggerated her role, and that she was merely trying to show appreciation for Flynn\u2019s support.) Flynn expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. Flynn said that he could probably get a congressional waiver, but if not he\u2019d settle for national-security adviser. A few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. On November 17th, after little vetting, Flynn was named Trump\u2019s national-security adviser, one of the most sensitive posts in the U.S. government. There is no indication that Pence raised any objections about Flynn to Trump, even after Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Pence a letter warning him about Flynn\u2019s questionable ethics: Flynn had failed to disclose that, during the campaign, he had done paid lobbying work for Turkish interests. A member of the original transition team told me, \u201cPence left his backbone in Indiana, if he ever had one.\u201d When reporters later asked Pence why he hadn\u2019t heeded Cummings\u2019s letter, he said that he\u2019d never seen it. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. \u201cEither he read it and ignored our warnings or someone on his team did so,\u201d Cummings told me. \u201cEither way, the outcome was horrendous, because President Trump should never have given General Flynn access to our nation\u2019s most sensitive and classified information.\u201d It undoubtedly would have cost Pence to take a political stand against the worst instincts of Trump and his family. But had Pence stopped Flynn\u2019s appointment Trump might not have become the object of a sprawling special investigation. Phil Sharp, the former Indiana representative, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a leadership test here. There are real issues, and a failure to do something he was legally, ethically, and politically responsible for.\u201d Sharp added, \u201cIt also failed the basic Washington litmus test of self-preservation.\u201d Pence soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. But then the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department had wiretaps of Flynn doing just that. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. On February 13th, Trump fired Flynn, ostensibly for deceiving Pence, who looked like either a liar or a chump. Three months later, Trump fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who had opened the federal investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s Russian ties. Pence declared that Comey\u2019s firing had nothing to do with Trump\u2019s displeasure at the Russia investigation. Trump, he said, had merely followed the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation. But Trump contradicted Pence within hours, telling NBC\u2019s Lester Holt that his anger over the Russia probe led him to dismiss Comey. Further damaging Pence\u2019s credibility, the Times revealed that, before Comey\u2019s dismissal, Pence had attended a White House meeting where Trump discussed his intention to fire Comey and devised a plan to get the Justice Department to support the move. Several law professors have argued that the Vice-President could be vulnerable to charges of obstructing justice, or \u201cmisprision of a felony,\u201d for participating in a meeting about shutting down the federal investigation and then providing a false cover story to the public. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, tweeted, \u201cThe VP appears to me to be in what we lawyers have been known to call deep doo-doo.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "f49838e1-65db-360b-b097-220107164f6e", "keywords": ["told", "president", "political", "pences", "republican", "campaign", "trump", "danger", "koch", "kochs", "pence", "indiana"], "title": "The Danger of President Pence", "summary": "\u201cThe President considers him one of his best decisions,\u201d Tony Fabrizio, a pollster for Trump, told me.\n\u201cIf Pence were to become President for any reason, the government would be run by the Koch brothers\u2014period.\n\u201cThere was some anguish.\u201d But in the end Pence told him, \u201cI need to protect the people of the state.\u201d \u201cI respect that,\u201d Tobin replied.\nPence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor.\nWhen Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had \u201chuge problems\u201d with his behavior.", "authors": ["Jane Mayer", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Ryan Lizza"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
