Donald Trump threatened legal action against author and publisher. He also lauded himself and his electoral college victory: \u201cI think that would qualify as not smart, but genius \u2026 and a very stable genius at that!\u201d", "Trump 'abused' and 'harassed' Kirstjen Nielsen over border, new book reveals Read more", "Trump\u2019s outburst confirmed what many already feared. In the aftermath of the firing of FBI director James Comey in May 2017, Rod Rosenstein, then deputy attorney general, reportedly weighed secretly recording the president with an eye to removing him from office under the 25th amendment.", "Now Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post offer A Very Stable Genius. As befitting Pulitzer winners for investigative reporting, their book is richly sourced and highly readable.", "It sheds new light on how the 45th president tests the boundaries of the office while trying the patience and dignity of those who work for or with him. It is not just another Trump tell-all or third-party confessional. It is unsettling, not salacious.", "Trump himself was quick to criticize the book, calling its authors \u201ctwo third rate Washington Post reporters\u201d. In a tweet on Saturday night, the president said the book was \u201call for the purpose of demeaning and belittling a President who is getting great things done for our Country, at a record clip\u201d.", "Rucker and Leonnig lift the curtain on internal battles over immigration and the attempt to replace John Kelly with Chris Christie as White House chief of staff. It also closely examines the scrum between Bill Barr, the attorney general, and Bob Mueller over Barr\u2019s handling of the special counsel\u2019s report on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.", "Trump\u2019s West Wing is tantamount to a family business and everything is personal", "Trump\u2019s West Wing is tantamount to a family business and everything is personal. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump obtain security clearances because they are kin.", "After publicly punting the issue to Kelly, Trump is described as applying pressure privately. \u201cI wish we could make this go away,\u201d he reportedly told Kelly. \u201cThis is a problem.\u201d Said differently, protocols and national security were treated as impediments, not safeguards, when Javanka got involved.", "When Trump cuts Kelly loose, Kushner and Ivanka are depicted as coveting the job. Their ambitions go unfulfilled but they continue to lurk in the background.", "Told by Rudy Giuliani that Trump wants him as his chief of staff, Christie asks why he would want the job if Kushner isn\u2019t leaving. For record, as a federal prosecutor Christie sent Charlie Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, to prison for \u201cone of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes\u201d on Christie\u2019s watch.", "\u201cWhy the fuck am I going to take this job?\u201d the former New Jersey governor exclaims. \u201cYou guys are nuts. I\u2019m not going in there.\u201d", "Still, Ivanka purportedly telephoned Christie\u2019s wife, Pat, to assure her bygones would be bygones. It didn\u2019t work.", "A Very Stable Genius also chronicles the back and forth between Trump\u2019s lawyers and the special counsel\u2019s office and the interplay between Barr and Mueller. Under George HW Bush, Barr was attorney general and Mueller headed the criminal division at the justice department. The two men were friends.", "Yet when Barr rolled out his summary of Mueller\u2019s report, Leonnig and Rucker write, the special counsel \u201clooked as if he\u2019d been slapped\u201d. When Mueller sent a rebuttal letter, objecting to Barr\u2019s summary, Barr was \u201cpissed\u201d, thought the letter \u201cnasty\u201d and felt personally \u201cbetrayed\u201d. Barr and Mueller spoke by phone, a tense conversation that ended on \u201can uplifting note.\u201d", "As for Trump and name-calling, nothing has changed. As a candidate, he mocked John McCain, a gold star family, a Latino judge and a disabled reporter. Life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has not alloyed that spirit.", "At a meeting in the Pentagon\u2019s inner sanctum, the \u201cTank\u201d, the draft-dodging Trump derided America\u2019s generals as \u201cdopes and babies\u201d. He added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to war with you people.\u201d Debasement was a coin of the realm.", "When Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of homeland security and a Kelly deputy, balked at Trump\u2019s demands on immigration, he berated her looks and height. For good measure, according to the authors, Trump would call her at 5am, just for the sake of harassment.", "After James Mattis advised Trump of his intent to resign as defense secretary, Trump moved his departure up two months. At a cabinet meeting, the president bragged that he had \u201cessentially\u201d fired the four-star general. For the president, policy differences invariably exploded into a matter of honor.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump speaks to the media while James Mattis minds his own business, in the cabinet room at the White House. Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters", "Mattis\u2019s resignation letter omitted any praise for the commander-in-chief. \u201cBecause you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI believe it is right for me to step down.\u201d", "The Age of Illusions review: anti-anti-Trump but for \u2026 what, exactly? Read more", "Likewise, Trump mocked HR McMaster, Michael Flynn\u2019s replacement as national security adviser, for his mien and wardrobe. The scholarly McMaster was always on borrowed time.", "Says one of McMaster\u2019s aides, Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t fire people \u2026 he tortures them until they\u2019re willing to quit.\u201d", "Clearly, Trumpworld has its share of casualties. Paul Manafort, a campaign manager, and Michael Cohen, a lawyer, sit imprisoned. Flynn and Roger Stone, a longtime political confidante, await sentencing.", "Trump\u2019s allergy to reality remains on display. His contention he doesn\u2019t know Lev Parnas is belied by video and email. The US now admits 11 troops attacked by Iran\u2019s missiles were treated for concussions.", "Leonnig and Rucker quote Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution, who says Trump \u201cappears to be daring the rest of the political system to stop him \u2013 and if it doesn\u2019t he\u2019ll go further. The law has no force without people who are willing to enforce it.\u201d", "As the Senate marches toward an impeachment trial and the countdown to the election ticks on, truer words have seldom been spoken."], "authors": ["Lloyd Green"], "keywords": ["king", "genius", "kelly", "security", "review", "mueller", "general", "president", "dysfunction", "stable", "disaster", "kushner", "donald", "trump", "barr", "court"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
