According to a report from Morgan Stanley published earlier this year, the global space industry could generate more than $1 trillion by 2040, up from about $350 billion today.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just starting,\u201d says Adam Jonas, managing director of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research at Morgan Stanley, adding that just a few years ago, investing in space would have been on the average investor\u2019s mind as much as autonomous cars were a decade ago, or electric cars were before Tesla went public.", "\u201cI\u2019d say it went from a zero out of 10 in terms of on people\u2019s minds, to approaching a one out of 10 today,\u201d he says. But make no mistake, the space industry is emerging due to the improved unit economics of putting things in orbit and improvements in technology. \u201cThe capability of what you can put 300 miles above the earth is very different\u201d than it was in the 1990s, he says.", "The main catalyst behind the space industry, Jonas says, is human missions, but there are multiple end markets and related adjacent industries within the space economy.", "He sees three main areas for growth: media communications, transportation (space travel for earth, moving people and things), \u2060and earth observation. Jonas describes the latter as turning the upper atmosphere and orbital planes into an area for data collection with innumerable uses, from predicting weather to improving supply chain efficiency\u2014even stopping illegal fishing.", "Jonas says these developments are important for the earth, because we need the perspective.", "\u201cIt\u2019s happening at a time when I think there may be some elevated consciousness in business and certainly amongst our clients, as to the earth and the changes of the earth, [and] how we view the change of earth\u2019s resources and the environment.\u201d", "Furthermore, the U.S. government\u2019s plans for a Space Command could help the industry take off like never before.", "\u201cThat combination of capitalism and national security could herald a more rapid development of this domain than people realize today,\u201d he says.", "Here\u2019s what Jonas says is important to keep in mind when considering space industry investments.", "Acknowledge the Sector\u2019s Difficulties", "Historically, investing in space has been home to cautionary tales, Jonas says. Space is hard, capital intensive, and an unproven market.", "\u201cIn many cases, there\u2019s unproven technology, unproven physics, and certainly unproven business models,\u201d he says.", "Despite a positive outlook for the sector, Jonas says it\u2019s no less difficult today.", "\u201cInvesting is speculative by nature\u2060\u2014investing in space is a different level of speculation,\u201d he says.", "\u201c The developments of travel and [communications] might take decades to play out. So be patient.\u201d \u201d \u2014Adam Jonas", "Part of the issue is that there are a lot of binary outcomes for the technologies, for example, getting approval for a certain band of communications, or not, without any in-between.", "\u201cI suspect that there will be many companies that would fail,\u201d he says.", "Investing in the marketplace isn\u2019t going to be all rocket launchers and space missions. As Jonas points out, there aren\u2019t a lot of pure play space companies to invest in at the moment. The Morgan Stanley Space 20, for instance, includes companies like GoDaddy and Shopify among those best exposed to growth from the space industry.", "\u201cYou might have to be willing to own an investment that may not be a 100% pure play space.\u201d", "Become an Expert", "\u201cMany of these [space] companies are private,\u201d Jonas says, \u201cmeaning the most exciting things that are going on are in the private domain.\u201d", "Some unicorns, like SpaceX, have an outsized impact on the rest of the space industry, but most companies are too small to move the needle.", "But that doesn't mean you shouldn\u2019t pay attention to smaller firms, because they might become public in the future. And there are still opportunities to invest in their orbit by investing in companies they partner with or in their supply chain.", "Jonas says that even if companies aren\u2019t accessible to invest in, they are worth keeping an eye on.", "\u201cThey might still be worth following because they might one day be public potentially, or they may be working on a topic that is at a bleeding edge of something that can affect the public markets,\u201d Jonas says.", "Focus On a Long-Time Horizon", "Jonas says space isn\u2019t the place to make a quick buck. \u201cAt least the developments of travel and [communications] might take decades to play out,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cSo be patient.\u201d", "Virgin Galactic, for example, which styles itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first commercial space line\u201d was founded in 2004 and has continually pushed back the date for commercial space flights, which it currently anticipates for 2020.", "Jonas says the investment phase for some firms in the space industry might last a decade or more before any revenue.", "\u201cIn this case you might need your DCF (discounted cash flow) to go out 30 years, 40 years,\u201d Jonas says. He uses the example of space mining and says that might require a 50-year DCF. \u201cNot every investor would be comfortable doing that.\u201d", "But for those who are willing, the potential for long--term returns might make it worth investing in the final frontier."], "id": "22ff113e-60b2-3b1f-b7ba-02fea366ae00", "authors": ["Rob Csernyik", "Adam Jonas"], "keywords": ["travel", "play", "companies", "industry", "jonas", "unproven", "earth", "invest", "space", "future", "investing", "returns", "developments", "technologies"], "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e", "pubDate": null}
