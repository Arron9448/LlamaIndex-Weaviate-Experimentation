If the measure fails to receive unanimous support, as is expected, the House will vote on the resolution on Tuesday. Pence, Pelosi said, would have \u201c24 hours\u201d to respond.", "Next, Pelosi said the House \u201cwill proceed with bringing impeachment legislation to the floor.\u201d Though she did not specify an exact timeline, top Democrats have suggested the House could begin proceedings as soon as midweek, with a Senate trial delayed \u2013 possibly for months \u2013 so as not distract from Joe Biden\u2019s agenda.", "Quick guide Impeaching Trump Show Hide Will Trump be impeached for a second time? Yes. Congressman Ted Lieu has said most Democrats in the House have signed on to articles of impeachment accusing the president of having \u201cgravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions\u201d that are due to be introduced on Monday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is on board. Is Trump heading to the Senate for trial? It seems so. A House majority will send the articles to the upper chamber, and it is hard to see any Democrats deserting their party. Some Republicans have also said the president needs to go. Can the Senate try Trump so close to Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration? Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that it can, although the narrow timeframe means the earliest a trial could be held would be after inauguration day, 20 January, when Trump will be out of power. The wait may be longer, however: on 10 January, House whip James Clyburn, who is close to Biden, indicated that Democrats may not send articles to the Senate until it has confirmed the new president\u2019s cabinet nominees \u2013 a vital process. Will he be convicted? Unlikely. Conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority. The chamber is split 50-50, and though some Republicans have either said Trump should go or indicated sympathy for impeachment, nowhere near enough seem likely to cross their own supporters by voting against the president to whom the party remains overwhelmingly loyal.", "So what happens if he gets off again? Barring a presidential pardon \u2013 which Trump may try to give to himself, a move most scholars doubt will work \u2013 once out of the White House Trump will be vulnerable to federal prosecution over acts in office. State investigations, including those under way in New York, can proceed and business creditors will circle.
