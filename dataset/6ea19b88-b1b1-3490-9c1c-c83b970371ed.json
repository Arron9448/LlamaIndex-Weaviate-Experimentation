Cats' last-minute dash to the cinema", "paragraphs": ["For film critics, London press screening schedules are devised like a military operation: timetabled, negotiated and cross-referenced by an army of distributors and publicists, with a view generally to keeping each major studio offering out of the other\u2019s way. The pre-Christmas crush is when the efficiency of the system tends to be most tested, but rarely has there been a scheduling overlap as high-profile and high-stakes as the one we saw on Monday night \u2013 as the large multimedia premieres of Cats and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker played back-to-back in Leicester Square, a long, loud double feature that sent bleary-eyed journalists home somewhere close to midnight.", "It wasn\u2019t always meant to be this way. The latest Star Wars episode had long had that premiere date nailed down: suitably close to its public release to appease studio spoilerphobia, and an acknowledgement that any franchise this critic-proof doesn\u2019t need long-lead reviews. Cats gatecrashing this week\u2019s schedule, however, was a frenzied move for a project that \u2013 despite years of gestation and development, not to mention a gargantuan budget \u2013 is looking increasingly like one of the most last-minute, down-to-the-wire blockbusters in Hollywood history.", "Tom Hooper\u2019s much hyped, fluorescent film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage smash began shooting last December, wrapped at the beginning of April, and has been mired in allegedly complex post-production ever since. \u201cAllegedly\u201d seems an unnecessary qualifier, in fact, given what the trailer already revealed as early as July. Coating a vast ensemble of human stars and dancers in fluid, tactile feline pelts was never going to be a simple task: \u201cdigital fur technology\u201d, as we\u2019ve been instructed to call it, wasn\u2019t built in a day. And it hasn\u2019t just been the visuals consuming time: word has it that multiple Soho sound studios were booked out last week in a concentrated push to finish the film\u2019s busy audio mix.", "Play Video 2:24 Watch the Cats movie trailer - video", "The delay has, it seems, come at some cost to the film\u2019s awards season momentum. Most critics\u2019 groups didn\u2019t get to see the film in time for their voting deadlines, though even in the best of circumstances, their tastes tend to skew more highbrow. More imperative was meeting the cutoff for Golden Globes voting. A not-quite-finished cut was shown to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, known for supporting razzle-dazzle musicals such as The Greatest Showman and Burlesque, but with dispiriting results: the effort yielded only one nomination, for Taylor Swift\u2019s original song Beautiful Ghosts. Even that seemingly surefire Oscars bid was shot down this week, as the Academy announced their shortlists for several categories: Swift\u2019s mournful ballad was nowhere to be seen among the 15 best song finalists, though the visual effects are still in contention.", "That those effects may be the film\u2019s best remaining shot at awards glory is somewhat ironic, considering what a point of contention they\u2019ve been. The images we saw back in the summer \u2013 to a global chorus of what-the-hell-is-that horror and delight that made an instant and inexhaustible meme factory out of a two-minute trailer \u2013 were, apparently, not quite finished.", "The internet\u2019s gleefully aghast reaction didn\u2019t prompt the kind of studio panic, rethink and redesign that we recently saw with Sonic the Hedgehog, but Hooper claims that some tweaking was done in response: \u201cThe visual effects [in the trailer] were at quite an early stage,\u201d he told Empire magazine. \u201cPossibly there were, in the extremity in some of the responses, some clues in how to keep evolving. When you watch the finished film, you\u2019ll see that some of the designs of the cats have moved on since then, and certainly our understanding of how to use the technology to make them work has gone up, too.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jennifer Hudson in Cats. Photograph: Allstar/Working Title films/Amblin Entertainment", "If this is true, it may take eagle-eyed effects buffs to spot the exact evolution: a second trailer, released in November, didn\u2019t look appreciably different from the first, though the shock impact of the human-cat hybrids\u2019 appearance was reduced with forewarning. (Ready or not from a technical perspective, Universal was wise to tease the film\u2019s look early and get us accustomed to its eccentricity.) And while the finished product is still under critical embargo for now, it\u2019s not incriminating to say that it delivers very much the spectacle that those fixated on the trailer are expecting: the technicians\u2019 many hours of painstaking work are nothing if not evident.", "Hooper is known in the industry for being exacting, but if he\u2019s been flustered by the film\u2019s scramble to the finish line, he\u2019s remained impassively cool in public \u2013 admitting casually on Monday\u2019s New York premiere that he\u2019d only locked the final cut at 8am the day before. He continues, moreover, to walk a fine line between deflecting the internet\u2019s bewilderment and humouring it. In response to a Variety reporter asking whether he was happy with Cats\u2019 finished look \u2013 not a question most directors would expect to be asked on the promotion trail, but a near-unavoidably salient one in this case \u2013 his answer was an expert PR play: having only officially finished the film 36 hours before, he was simply glad to be showing it at all. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be here with it fully finished, and yeah, we\u2019ll let the audience decide, but it\u2019s come a long way since that first trailer.\u201d", "It\u2019s being left to the actors, it seems, to take a more defensive approach. \u201cI thought that reaction [to the trailer] was absolutely ludicrous,\u201d Ian McKellen fumed in an interview this week, going on to declare the finished film \u201can absolute classic\u201d. \u201cI can tell those doubters who\u2019ve only seen snippets of a trailer that they\u2019re absolutely wrong, and if they don\u2019t agree with me, then keep away.\u201d Hooper\u2019s more measured \u201clet the audience decide\u201d line is harder to argue with. Never a film made for critics, and with its awards-season hopes looking ever leaner, Cats will be counting on a vast, breathless public \u2013 one both uninformed of and uninterested in its production and scheduling complications \u2013 to make those sleepless nights worthwhile."], "authors": ["Guy Lodge"], "keywords": ["trailer", "lastminute", "way", "feline", "film", "studio", "saw", "finished", "week", "cinema", "confident", "dash", "effects", "cats", "films"]}
