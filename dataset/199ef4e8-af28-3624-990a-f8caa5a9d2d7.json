First came the very couple-y Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde photos (my jaw is still on the floor), then Emma Stone\u2019s major pregnancy news, which melted my heart, and just when I thought things couldn\u2019t get any better in celeb land, on the fashion front, I found the most glorious pair of Khaite flats on sale\u2014wait\u2014and a dreamy Bottega Veneta bag at 40% off. I\u2019ve had my eye on both pieces for quite some time, but now seems like the perfect moment to finally make that investment and do so at just the right sweet spot price, especially since my new style mantra this year is quality over quantity. In fact, there are currently a ton of equally chic and beautifully made items marked down thanks to the celebratory New Year\u2019s sales.", "If you too are hoping to make 2021 your most stylish year ever, now is the time to snag, say, Loewe\u2019s curved-frame sunglasses, a Le Porte Cl\u00e9s Chiquito keychain from Jacquemus, or one of Telfar\u2019s always-sold-out shoes without paying full price. Plus, there are a few beauty and home offerings that are just as good as the clothes and accessories. But of course, navigating through the vast sea of online retailers, along with their individual deals and steals, can be cumbersome. That being said, you won\u2019t have to do too much work because you\u2019ll find Vogue\u2019s favorite picks from the vast but fabulous New Year\u2019s sales just ahead.
