With video games, you never know if you\u2019ll be flying into space, controlling a sword-wielding samurai, or shooting three-pointers like you\u2019re Steph Curry. This year, innovation in gaming took a major upswing. In one game, you control a waddling goose, and in another -- you go face-to-face with Darth Vader.", "1. \u201cUntitled Goose Game\u201d", "", "Tested on: Nintendo Switch", "My top pick of the year, the strange and unusual \u201cUntitled Goose Game\u201d is fun to play but it\u2019s also entertaining to watch someone else play. The intricate puzzles (my favorite involved tricking a farmer) are one thing, but you play as a goose that waddles around. That is unique.", "2. \u201cControl\u201d", "Tested on: Xbox One", "What makes \u201cControl\u201d so innovative is that the story and the gameplay blend together. Even your weapon plays a role as you switch between multiple realities. Graphically, the game uses a mind-bending visual presentation where everything is not as it seems.", "3. \u201cDeath Stranding\u201d", "Tested on: Sony PlayStation 4", "The main innovation in \u201cDeath Stranding\u201d is that you rarely shoot or kill anything. The missions involve transporting packages and avoiding ghostly enemies. My favorite moment (spoiler alert) happened when I used a ladder left behind by another player.", "'I AM JESUS CHRIST' VIDEO GAME CAUSES STIR", "4. \u201cVader Immortal\u201d", "Tested on: Oculus Quest", "A VR game for the Oculus Quest, \u201cVader Immortal\u201d is more like a movie than a game, and I was sucked in by the ever-present mythology and detailed story arc. It often feels more like a richly-detailed \u201cStar Wars\u201d book. My ultimate wish fulfillment? Wielding a realistic-looking lightsaber.", "5. \u201cSea of Solitude\u201d", "Tested on: Xbox One", "\u201cSea of Solitude\u201d is a deeply personal and detailed game -- you play a monster trying to figure out how you became one. The game sticks in your head for days. It\u2019s about the lingering effects of mental illness and resolving past conflicts. Graphically, it looks like an animated cartoon.", "6. \u201cBeat Saber\u201d", "Tested on: Oculus Quest", "You\u2019ll probably start smiling and laughing when you play the VR game \u201cBeat Saber.\u201d Unlike a first-person shooter or a puzzle game, the goal is to make quick movements in time with the music. It\u2019s incredibly fun but unique in that you have to groove to the music.", "10 TOP GADGETS OF 2019", "6. \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2\u201d", "Tested on: Xbox One", "Innovation isn\u2019t always about the gameplay. \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2\u201d is exquisitely detailed, more than any other game I\u2019ve ever played. It recreates an entire world, right down to the debris floating around in the street to the blasted-out buildings.", "7. \u201cYoshi\u2019s Crafted World\u201d", "Tested on: Nintendo Switch", "I don\u2019t normally include games intended for kids, but \u201cYoshi\u2019s Crafted World\u201d is wildly original (even for adults). You can flip the screen to see alternative paths in 3D, and the characters look like they are stuffed animals. The game world also looks like it is made of cardboard.", "8. \u201cA Plague Tale: Innocence\u201d", "Tested on: Windows PC", "In \u201cA Plague Tale: Innocence,\u201d you play as a child leading another child -- avoiding enemies and (in one darkly demented scene) avoiding a rat infestation. You feel powerless and the game is often distressing and off-putting, which makes it intensely original.", "9. \u201cMinecraft Earth\u201d", "Tested on: Apple iPhone", "A brilliant new addition to the \u201cMinecraft\u201d canon of games, \u201cMinecraft Earth\u201d uses augmented reality so you can overlay the game board on the physical world and add other human players. I built a sheep farm on a table at the library, adding stone tiles and designing a lush green forest.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "10. \u201cArise: A Simple Story\u201d", "Tested on: Xbox One", "Bending time is not a new concept for video games, but somehow \u201cArise: A Simple Story\u201d makes it seem unique -- mostly because it ties into the emotional, uplifting story about life evaluation. Adjusting time gives you a new route through the level right from the opening scene."], "id": "64a04f83-9b15-3506-a22c-60edda28642e", "summary": "With video games, you never know if you\u2019ll be flying into space, controlling a sword-wielding samurai, or shooting three-pointers like you\u2019re Steph Curry.\n\u201cControl\u201dTested on: Xbox OneWhat makes \u201cControl\u201d so innovative is that the story and the gameplay blend together.\n'I AM JESUS CHRIST' VIDEO GAME CAUSES STIR4.\n\u201cYoshi\u2019s Crafted World\u201dTested on: Nintendo SwitchI don\u2019t normally include games intended for kids, but \u201cYoshi\u2019s Crafted World\u201d is wildly original (even for adults).\nThe game world also looks like it is made of cardboard."}
