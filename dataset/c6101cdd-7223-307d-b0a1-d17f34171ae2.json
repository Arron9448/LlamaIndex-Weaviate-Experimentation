But the attempts by both the mob and Mr Trump\u2019s congressional allies to overturn the result of November\u2019s election failed when Congress confirmed Mr Biden as the new president in the early hours of January 7th.", "Soon after the joint session began, hundreds of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol building, chanting \u201cStop the steal\u201d, tearing down fencing, overwhelming the police and forcing their way in. Police evacuated staffers from Hill office buildings. Both chambers of Congress adjourned (they were debating an objection made by Paul Gosar, a far-right congressman from Arizona, to his own state\u2019s certified results\u2014an objection that won him a round of applause from his caucus). The secret service whisked Vice-President Mike Pence away. Police even reportedly began evacuating private homes near the Capitol.", "Some trouble had been expected, but of the procedural kind. Usually, the vice-president opens sealed state certifications of victory in alphabetical order, hands them to \u201ctellers\u201d\u2014usually members of the two chambers\u2019 administration committees\u2014to read, and then announces the results. It lasted 23 minutes in 2013, and 41 in 2017. This time, around two-thirds of the House Republican caucus, along with at least 11 senators, had already announced their plans to object to some states\u2019 results. Every objection adjourns the joint session for up to two hours\u2019 debate. The end was not in doubt\u2014majorities of the House and Senate have already said they would recognise Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and the objections were thoroughly groundless. But many Republicans were prepared to show fealty to a roundly defeated president to stretch out the process well into the evening. What ultimately happened was much worse.", "It did not come out of the blue. Late last year, in one of his innumerable evidence-free tweets alleging electoral malfeasance, Mr Trump trailed a \u201cBig protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\u201d For days leading up to the 6th, Trump supporters discussed plans for the rally: how to sneak guns into Washington, DC; whether to storm the Capitol, burn it down or assault journalists; how Washington\u2019s mayor needed to be \u201cexterminated\u201d and how they needed to \u201cbuild the gallows outside Congress, be mentally prepared to pull \u2018em out and string them up.\u201d", "Shortly before noon\u2014an hour before the joint session was due to begin\u2014Mr Trump told his massed supporters, \u201cWe will never concede.\u201d He said that Mr Pence had to \u201csend it back to the states to recertify, and then we become president.\u201d Mr Pence has no such power, as he himself recognised in a letter sent to lawmakers shortly before the joint session. Mr Trump then told his supporters to \u201cwalk down...to the Capitol...you\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\u201d", "They followed his instructions, leading to scenes inside the Capitol unlike any in living memory. A mob stormed the Senate floor, seated themselves at the dais and broke into congressional offices. One was photographed reclining in the chair of Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, with a foot on her desk. Police used tear gas, and drew their guns on the House floor to keep the mob out. A woman was shot and killed inside the building, but the circumstances were unclear. Staffers and elected officials who could not leave the Capitol were told to shelter in place and stay away from doors and windows. The National Guard from surrounding states were being summoned to help restore order\u2014though reportedly at the order of Mr Pence rather than the president, as is customary. Christopher Miller, the acting defense secretary, said the Guard had been activated after he spoke with \u201cthe Vice President and with Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, Senator Schumer and Representative Hoyer about the situation at the US Capitol.\u201d He did not mention Mr Trump.", "It didn\u2019t end there. A pipe bomb was found and neutralised at the Republican National Committee\u2019s headquarters; a suspicious package was found at the Democrats\u2019 headquarters. Muriel Bowser, Washington\u2019s mayor, declared a curfew from 6pm to 6am. Mr Biden called the mob\u2019s actions \u201can assault on the rule of law\u201d that \u201cborders on sedition\u201d. Eventually Mr Trump released a video message telling his supporters to go home, but repeated the lie that the election was stolen from him and added: \u201cWe love you. You\u2019re very special.\u201d One can easily imagine America\u2019s State Department\u2014at least in the pre-Trump era\u2014witnessing such events in another country and calling them an attempted coup.", "The mob storming the halls of Congress represents the logical end of Trumpism. He rose to power claiming that he alone could set right what ails America. He repeatedly declined to accept as legitimate any election he did not win. He displayed contempt for political norms and the rule of law, fantasised about arresting and harming his political opponents, and consistently put his own interests ahead of America\u2019s. He holds a sizeable minority of the electorate in personal thrall; it should surprise nobody that some responded violently.", "Amid the chaos, the confirmation debate eventually restarted late in the evening. \u201cViolence never wins. Freedom wins,\" declared Mr Pence. Several chastened Republican senators said they would no longer object to the election results, among them Kelly Loeffler, who on January 6th lost her Georgia seat. Ms Loeffler said she could no longer dispute the presidential ballot \u201cin good conscience\u201d. Even so, a handful of hold-out Republicans continued to object to the certification of the vote, among them Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. As one objection after another was voted down, Congress eventually confirmed that Mr Biden had won 306 electoral-college votes. Belatedly, Mr Trump promised \u201can orderly transition.\u201d", "Even so, the mayhem has shaken American politics and the country\u2019s place in the world. The pride Americans have rightly felt at the resilience of their institutions, including the peaceful transfer of presidential power, is diminished. The question now is whether the jarring spectacle makes breaking up with Mr Trump easier for Republicans. It certainly should. When he entered office four years ago, Republicans controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress; when he leaves, Democrats will hold all three. The last time that happened was 1892.", "Editor\u2019s note: this article was updated after Congress resumed business", "Dig deeper:", "Read the best of our coverage of the presidential transition, then sign up for Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["trumps", "transfer", "mayhem", "capitol", "session", "supporters", "president", "congress", "house", "joint", "power", "pence", "block", "storm", "washington", "mr", "trump"], "pubDate": "2021-01-06T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
