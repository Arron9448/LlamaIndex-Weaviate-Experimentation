The night before, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her party had made a momentous political shift and launched a full-scale impeachment investigation of the President. The move was triggered by a new scandal, the details of which have emerged in recent days: Trump, having escaped impeachment over the Mueller investigation, turns out to have asked Ukraine\u2019s new President to investigate the former Vice-President Joe Biden, at the same time that he was holding up more than three hundred million dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The disclosure had proved to be too much, even for the cautious Pelosi. Now Trump faces the very real possibility that he will become only the fourth President in U.S. history to confront a House majority ready to impeach him. Trump, however, had one play left. On Wednesday morning, he released the full White House account of his July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump, his allies, and his advisers promised that it would be less than meets the eye. Releasing the call summary, they insisted, would undercut the impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine matter before it even started. On Fox, the reporter Ed Henry quoted a Trump source who warned Democrats: \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there.\u201d The new editor of the conservative Washington Free Beacon tweeted, \u201cTold reliably by source who has seen a transcript of the call that it isn\u2019t likely to live up to the high expectations many have.\u201d Trump himself got into the pre-spin game. \u201cWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?\u201d he tweeted at 9:17 A.M. Wednesday. \u201cThey should, a perfect call\u2014got them by surprise!\u201d Then, at precisely 10 A.M., the White House released its version of the call, which was based on notes taken at the time. It did not say what President Trump and his advisers had suggested it would say. Not at all. Usually in American politics, the goal in the expectations game is to tamp them down; in this case, Trump had succeeded at the opposite, promoting the notion that his phone call with Zelensky would be proved innocuous, with nary a whiff of impropriety. Instead, the document released by his own staff added new information to the scandal, revealing that Trump had not only requested an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter but had specifically asked Zelensky to co\u00f6perate with his private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, and the Attorney General, William Barr, on it. The President\u2019s language was hardly subtle. Trump mentioned the Attorney General four times. \u201cThe United States has been very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump said early in the call, before quickly adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily.\u201d After Zelensky responded by requesting approval to buy more U.S. anti-tank Javelin missiles, to aid his fight against Russia, Trump replied by explaining the reciprocity he really wanted: investigations of the Bidens and also of Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 U.S. elections. How Trump Could Get Fired Evan Osnos on what it would take to cut short Trump\u2019s Presidency. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d the President said, in a line that seems destined to land in the history books. \u201cWhatever you can do,\u201d Trump added later in the conversation, \u201cit\u2019s very important that you do it.\u201d This was not the exculpatory moment that Trump had claimed it would be. Impeachment may have been an uncertain outcome before 10 A.M. on Wednesday. Afterward, it was a near-certainty.", "The most interesting moments to be in Washington are when the conventional wisdom is shifting and not everyone knows it yet, or when an old certainty has been shredded and nothing has emerged to replace it. As of Monday morning, the political world was pretty sure that Donald Trump would not be impeached by the Democratic House of Representatives, and that he would enter the 2020 campaign and race to win re\u00eblection, before the economy betrayed him with a recession that forecasters increasingly see as inevitable. Instead, over a remarkable day and a half, a new reality emerged: Donald Trump appears to have got himself impeached. Trump now seems all but certain not only to face an impeachment investigation but an actual impeachment vote in the House. And, whenever it happens, and whatever the specifics of the indictment turn out to be, the impeachment vote will have been triggered by a new scandal very much of his own making. Nine o\u2019clock on Monday night is more or less when the conventional wisdom collapsed. It was then that the Washington Post published a remarkable op-ed by seven key freshmen House Democrats from swing districts. They are known collectively on Capitol Hill as \u201cmajority makers\u201d and \u201cfront-liners.\u201d (In the case of the group\u2019s five women, they have taken to calling themselves \u201cthe bad-ass caucus,\u201d as CNN\u2019s Dana Bash pointed out.) All seven served in national-security positions and previously had been reluctant to endorse impeachment proceedings. Now they had decided to hold hands and jump, together. \u201cThese allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect,\u201d they wrote, calling Trump\u2019s actions, if true, both illegal and grounds for impeachment. \u201cThis flagrant disregard for the law cannot stand,\u201d they wrote. Soon after, one by one, more House Democrats who had previously refused to support impeachment came out in favor of it. By 11 P.M., even close allies of Pelosi, such as Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Debbie Dingell, had switched sides. It was a Washington stampede. Of course, Monday night may not have been the actual moment when the politics changed. You could date it backward a few days, to the previous Tuesday, when Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, announced that a whistle-blower inside the U.S. intelligence community, who had information about serious wrongdoing, had come forward but that his complaint was not being shared with Congress, despite a law requiring its disclosure. In the following days it emerged that the subject of the complaint was Trump himself and that it involved Ukraine. By the weekend, Trump acknowledged that he spoke directly with Zelensky about investigating Biden, and news organizations were reporting that the President had personally held up the more than three hundred million dollars in aid to Ukraine eight days before their call. By Sunday, Schiff was on television suggesting that Democrats might now be finally ready to \u201ccross the Rubicon\u201d of impeachment. Schiff, a close Pelosi ally, was signalling the political shift to come. On Monday afternoon, Pelosi had quietly given permission to her troops to bolt on impeachment, including to the op-ed signatories, with whom she privately met (as one of them, Representative Elissa Slotkin, later confirmed publicly). Remarkably, Democrats appeared to be making the decision to move on impeachment not because they believed it would benefit the Party politically. By Monday, polls still showed that a majority of Americans were firmly against it. Slotkin, who was elected in 2016 in a traditionally Republican district in Michigan, risks losing her seat. She and other Democrats seem to be proceeding despite the politics, not because of them. Read More Why the whistle-blower complaint is the work of democracy, not the deep state. By Tuesday morning, there was a new conventional wisdom settling in, but Trump, up at the United Nations, in New York, for the annual General Assembly, did not seem to have received the message. At fifteen after ten that morning, he delivered a combative address to the assembled \u201cglobalists\u201d about the failures of their internationalism and the benefits of his own, Trump-style nationalism. At one point, he lectured them about \u201cwise leaders\u201d who put the interests of their nations first, proving if nothing else that Trump is immune to irony. In Washington, more Democrats called for impeachment. At noon, Representative John Lewis, the civil-rights hero, came to the House floor. \u201cI truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this President has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy,\u201d he said. He and other close allies of Pelosi in the Congressional Black Caucus had for months deferred to her on impeachment. His words now showed where the Speaker intended to end the day. At this point, the fight was not over whether Democrats would proceed but how they would do so. On Capitol Hill, those are the details that matter; process often dictates outcome, and no one was sure what exactly the process would be. Would this new inquiry cover the Mueller report, with its description of ten incidents of alleged obstruction of justice by the President? Or stick closely to the new Ukraine allegations? For months, there had been talk of creating a select committee to investigate Trump, with Schiff at its head. Advocates of the idea saw it as a way to reduce the cacophony and ineffectiveness of ongoing investigations by six different committees (and their attention-seeking chairmen), which had hampered House efforts. On Tuesday afternoon, an unusual alliance of Never Trump Republicans, such as Bill Kristol, and the influential freshman progressive leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez emerged to publicly fight the plan for a select committee, with Ocasio-Cortez warning that a new panel would lead to endless delay. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of time w/another committee,\u201d she tweeted. The House Judiciary Committee is already investigating, and \u201cimpeachment belongs there,\u201d she added. By midafternoon on Tuesday, everyone\u2014Trump and also his Democratic critics\u2014understood that this was an inflection point. At 2:12 P.M., while still at the U.N., Trump announced, via tweet, the Wednesday release of the \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his call with Zelensky. At 2:29 P.M. came a rejoinder from Schiff, who said that the House Intelligence panel hoped to have the whistle-blower testify \u201cas soon as this week.\u201d And then aides to Pelosi confirmed to reporters that she would move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry. At four o\u2019clock, House Democrats met in caucus to hear Pelosi explain the path forward. At 4:30 P.M., the Senate acted, too, taking the unusually bipartisan step of voting unanimously to require the intelligence community to turn over the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint. In the closed-door House-caucus meeting, meanwhile, some Democratic members appeared to feed direct, verbatim quotes to congressional reporters, who soon disclosed that Pelosi would not go for the select-committee option but would leave jurisdiction over impeachment to the House Judiciary Committee, with other panels charged with sending Judiciary their findings. \u201cHere we are,\u201d Pelosi reportedly said. \u201cA moment of truth.\u201d At 5 P.M., Pelosi walked out to the Speaker\u2019s Balcony and informed the press and public of what they already knew: impeachment was official, though she gave almost no other details. \u201cThe President must be held accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d The President, meanwhile, had a different approach to a day whose developments portended troubled times ahead for an already troubled democracy. At the U.N., Trump abruptly ordered his motorcade back to Trump Tower for some executive TV time. Trump\u2019s response to the Speaker came soon afterward, in a quick blast of tweets attacking what he called the \u201cbreaking news Witch Hunt garbage\u201d once again overshadowing everything else in his Presidency. \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201d he lamented. And, also, \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/do-us-a-favor-the-forty-eight-hours-that-sealed-trumps-impeachment", "keywords": ["house", "committee", "favor", "impeachment", "ukraine", "hours", "fortyeight", "sealed", "trump", "democrats", "president", "pelosi", "washington", "trumps", "zelensky"], "summary": "President Trump began Wednesday in a dark place.\nIt did not say what President Trump and his advisers had suggested it would say.\nTrump now seems all but certain not only to face an impeachment investigation but an actual impeachment vote in the House.\nIt was then that the Washington Post published a remarkable op-ed by seven key freshmen House Democrats from swing districts.\nSoon after, one by one, more House Democrats who had previously refused to support impeachment came out in favor of it.", "authors": ["Susan B.
