My uncle \u2013 the same guy who told me that the next Splatoon game is like Grand Theft Auto and you can drive cars that shoot paint and hijack a rocketship and go to the original game \u2013 doesn\u2019t work at Nintendo anymore. He got promoted \u2026 to Fortnite!", "He just started a few weeks ago, so he doesn\u2019t know ALL the secrets yet. I did manage to get some cool information from him, though. Remember that Galactus fight at the end of that Marvel season? Did you know that you can actually play as him? I gave my Gamertag to my uncle, and he gave me access to Galactus and every skin and emote in the game. You basically stomp on everyone on the island and one-hit them. And you can pick up the towers in Steamy Stacks and smoke them like cigarettes and also walk over to the waiting-room island and then you get the bus as a glider. It\u2019s really cool.", "The next season is going to be even better than any of the old ones. You\u2019re going to be able to build guns and bombs, and then your forts can be like army bases. Also, that Lexa anime skin was a test \u2013 they\u2019re going to be adding Naruto and Avatar into the game. Fortnite saw what Roblox is doing, and they\u2019re putting Peppa Pig and Jeff the Killer into the game, too, but that might not happen until the next season. Either way, my uncle is giving me free Battle Passes and V-Bux for life. It\u2019s awesome.", "And before you ask, he left the Smash Bros. code for zero-suit Zero Suit Samus in his old desk at Nintendo and they wouldn\u2019t let him go back in and grab it. He showed it to me on his phone though, and it was really great guys.
