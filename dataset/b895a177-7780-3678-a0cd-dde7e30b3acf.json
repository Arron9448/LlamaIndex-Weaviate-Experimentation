On December 6th the Saudi Arabian pilot turned his gun on his hosts, shooting 11 people and killing three. That has put a spotlight on the 5,181 foreign students from 153 countries currently receiving military training in America. In fiscal 2017-18 foreign governments splashed out $462.4m for American security training, and the American government chipped in another $39.8m. The main exchange programme is the $115m International Military Education and Training scheme, funded by the State Department. It includes 4,000 courses across 150 American military schools.", "Such programmes have two aims. One is to improve foreign armed forces\u2014\u201cideally in a manner that contributes to the development of a professional, apolitical military that respects civilian authority,\u201d says Walter Ladwig of King\u2019s College London. The other is to cultivate upwardly-mobile officers, who are likely to wind up as generals and admirals. \u201cThis might mean co-operation in a future crisis or a willingness to grant the US access to bases or overflight rights,\u201d says Mr Ladwig.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "There is no doubt that America gains powerful friends.

In April the US Army Command and Staff College inducted three alumni into its hall of fame: the current army or military chiefs of Argentina, India and Jamaica. More than 280 of the college\u2019s 8,000 foreign graduates have gone on to lead their countries\u2019 armed forces, and 15 have become heads of state or government.", "It is less clear whether the quality of soldiering goes up. Countries are supposed to send their best and brightest, but are often less exacting. \u201cThere were always comedy/horror stories floating around about the African militaries who sent personnel on US -funded diving courses who couldn\u2019t swim,\u201d recalls someone involved with counter-terror training. In May the Pentagon cancelled a training programme for Afghan pilots after 48% of trainees deserted.", "Critics also complain that American training simply boosts the repressive capacity of tyrannical governments. Saudi Arabia sent 1,652 students in fiscal 2019, more than any other country. Among other ruling despots, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt\u2019s dictator, attended the US Army War College in 2005-06 (his thesis was aptly titled \u201cDemocracy in the Middle East\u201d)."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "A shooting puts the spotlight on military training for allies", "pubDate": null, "summary": "That has put a spotlight on the 5,181 foreign students from 153 countries currently receiving military training in America.\nIn fiscal 2017-18 foreign governments splashed out $462.4m for American security training, and the American government chipped in another $39.8m.\nThe main exchange programme is the $115m International Military Education and Training scheme, funded by the State Department.\nIt includes 4,000 courses across 150 American military schools.\nCritics also complain that American training simply boosts the repressive capacity of tyrannical governments.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/12/12/a-shooting-puts-the-spotlight-on-military-training-for-allies"}
