The lion suddenly looks up. The men fear they have been spotted. One of them slowly removes his boots and puts on a pair of running shoes. \u201cYou will never outrun a lion in those,\u201d says his colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t need to outrun the lion,\u201d replies the first man as he slowly ties his shoelaces. \u201cI just need to outrun you.\u201d", "The joke rather neatly captures a particular approach to investing. What matters is not so much whether you can get ahead of some absolute goal for returns. The important thing is whether the asset you choose to invest in will comfortably beat the alternatives.", "Share prices in America are at all-time highs. The cyclically adjusted price-earnings ( CAPE ) ratio, a measure of value popularised by Robert Shiller of Yale University, has only twice been higher than it is now\u2014in the late 1920s and the early 2000s. Yet a recent study by Mr Shiller, Laurence Black and Farouk Jivraj suggests that today\u2019s steep stock prices may still be warranted, because interest rates are so low. Indeed, compared with the real yields offered on risk-free government bonds, equity prices have plenty of appeal. Equities do not have to beat their historical returns to be worth holding, it would seem. They just need to outrun bonds by a decent margin.", "A key strut to this thinking is that the earnings yield\u2014the inverse of the price-earnings ratio\u2014is a decent forecast of expected returns on equities. An empirical study in 1988 by Mr Shiller and John Campbell found that yields on equities help predict long-term returns. The dividend yield (ie, the dividend-to-price ratio) and three different measures of earnings yield all show some forecasting power, which is to say they explain at least some of the variation in future returns. The longer the horizon over which returns are measured, the better the prediction. And the best measure to use is an average of a few years of earnings, because profits are noisy from one year to the next. The use of an average of recent earnings goes back at least to Benjamin Graham, a pioneer of stock valuation. Mr Shiller\u2019s CAPE is simply an extension of this approach."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["buttonwood", "lion", "returns", "bonds", "cheap", "earnings", "need", "mr", "stocks", "yields", "outrun", "prices", "equities", "shiller", "relative"], "pubDate": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
