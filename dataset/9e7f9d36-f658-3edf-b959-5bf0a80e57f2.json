Read part two, here.", "On a humid Saturday in August 2019, I was in a bathtub at Victoria + Albert in London with my head on the rim, scrunched in the posture of a bather. I had known where we were going and for what purpose, so it made no sense to have worn a short dress but there you are. I slithered in and out with my arms clamped to my sides. Over the edge I could see my husband in another tub, pantomime floating, and between us, a salesperson studying a drawing of our flat, trying to work out which of the baths would fit.", "I\u2019d made the bathtub appointment more than a year earlier. The tone of the email had been chatty, and mentioned that we would start building work pretty soon. Then I\u2019d written again and put it off for a month, and then another month, and another, becoming increasingly curt, until it was eighteen months later and it seemed like it might be less humiliating to just put in a shower. The delay was down to planning permission, I wrote, but we have it now, and the builders are starting in six months, come what may (except if what\u2019s coming is a pandemic, so it was another year). The people at Victoria + Albert could not have been nicer. In my mind\u2019s eye, they would read these updates about \u201cthe flat\u201d and tut, wise to an ongoing delusion but too polite not to play along.", "Three years ago we bought the top half of a Georgian home in Islington, on a square that reminds me of scenes from Mary Poppins. The houses have narrow faces with big windows, and spindly wrought iron balconies that most people only dare to use for pots. The agent for the property warned us that its historical listing and conservation zone would mean some hoop jumping, even to do things like update the plumbing, or change the color of the front door. Our architect, Chris Dyson, warned us too. Neighbours in similar houses chimed in with their own renovation stories, honed to plucky reminiscences about Christmas dinners cooked on hot plates."], "authors": ["Jo Rodgers", "Jo Rodger"], "keywords": ["victoria", "flat", "georgian", "inside", "london", "renovation", "warned", "houses", "19thcentury", "read", "work", "months", "month"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
