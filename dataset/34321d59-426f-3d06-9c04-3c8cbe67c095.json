There\u2019s dialogue, for instance; one trailer opens with a voice-over from Judi Dench, who plays a character named Old Deuteronomy. \u201cTonight is a magical night where I choose the cat that deserves a new life,\u201d she says. \u201cI judge a cat by its soul.\u201d Seems straightforward. And, instead of having actors play human-sized cats, as is done in the stage version, Hooper opted for cat-sized humanoids.", "The source material, \u201cOld Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats,\u201d is a collection of poems that T. S. Eliot wrote for his godchildren. \u201cThe poems were written in the nonsense tradition,\u201d Carolyn Vega, the curator for the Berg Collection, at the New York Public Library, explained recently. Sara Beth Joren, a publicist for the library, chimed in: \u201cAnd that\u2019s why when people hate on \u2018Cats\u2019\u2014like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s no plot.\u2019 It\u2019s just, like, \u2018Yeah, there wasn\u2019t supposed to be.\u2019 And, anyway, there is a plot. There\u2019s a cat trying to go to the Heaviside Layer. That\u2019s a plot.\u201d", "The two women were waiting for Francesca Hayward, one of the stars of the \u201cCats\u201d movie. Hayward, a principal dancer in the Royal Ballet, plays Victoria, a graceful white cat\u2014her first film role. Vega was ready to give Hayward a quick Eliot lesson; she had brought out a first edition of \u201cOld Possum\u201d and some photographs of the poet.", "Joren had on cat-shaped stud earrings, a leopard-print scarf, and a vintage \u201cCATS LONDON\u201d T-shirt. \u201cMy grandmother\u2019s cat was named Jennyanydots, and the first cat living in our home when I was born was Mistoffelees,\u201d she said, name-checking Eliot\u2019s felines. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018Cats\u2019 people.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember if I\u2019ve actually seen the musical,\u201d Vega said. She explained that her aunt used to act out bits from the show. \u201cSo do I have a real memory of seeing it?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr do I just remember Aunt Debie?\u201d", "Hayward walked in, wearing a big black zip-up sweater, her long brown hair loose. Vega showed her the \u201cOld Possum\u201d first edition, and her eyes widened. \u201cI bought one of these, with the same design on the front, for Tom Hooper, as a present,\u201d she said.", "Vega said, \u201cYou probably know that the poems were written for very specific children\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cThis is all very educational for me. Old Possum was Eliot\u2019s nickname, right? By one of his friends?\u201d", "\u201cYes, given to him by Ezra Pound,\u201d Vega said.", "\u201cWho\u2019s Ezra Pound?\u201d Hayward asked.", "\u201cAnother literary figure of the time,\u201d Vega said, evidently deciding not to go into Pound\u2019s Fascist sympathies.", "Hayward paged through the book, pausing to appreciate certain cats. (Noticeably absent from the book was her own character, Victoria\u2014an Andrew Lloyd Webber creation.)", "\u201cThere was one Eliot poem that was used for the adaptations that\u2019s not in the book, which is Grizabella,\u201d Vega said, referring to the bedraggled cat, apparently a former sex worker, who sings \u201cMemory.\u201d (She\u2019s played by Jennifer Hudson in the film.) \u201cThe poem wasn\u2019t included in any of the published books. It was thought that it was too sad for kids.\u201d", "Victoria, Hayward explained, has something in common with Grizabella. As the latter tries to win the approval of the other Jellicle Cats, Victoria, the newest member of the gang, frets. \u201cShe\u2019s having all these feelings, like, \u2018Do I fit in?\u2019 \u201d Hayward said.", "In Hooper\u2019s version, Victoria sings as well as dances; Webber composed a new song, \u201cBeautiful Ghosts,\u201d for her, and Taylor Swift (who plays Bombalurina in the film) helped write the lyrics\u2014in the style of Eliot. (As Swift put it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t get T. S. Eliot, get T.S.!\u201d)", "When the first trailer for \u201cCats\u201d dropped, in July, Hayward was working in Mexico. \u201cI hurried to the hotel lobby and got some Wi-Fi, and then I watched it over and over again,\u201d she said. The trailer opens with her character turning to look at the camera, which she called a \u201ckind of gasp moment.\u201d She continued, \u201cI was also just processing the fact that my ears were in a different place. It\u2019s weird to see yourself without your own ears.\u201d", "Viewers of the trailer had a strong negative reaction to Hooper\u2019s \u201cdigital fur technology,\u201d which had given the actors tails, whiskers, and furry coats without removing their human fingers, toes, knees, lips, noses, or teeth. The backlash was so extreme that Hooper tweaked the C.G.I. for the final cut. Hayward was unruffled. \u201cThe cast has taken it with a great sense of humor,\u201d she said. They communicate with one another on a WhatsApp group, sharing funny reactions to the trailer and other \u201cCats\u201d memes.", "\u201cI think people who criticize the trailer haven\u2019t seen the stage version,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cI think we\u2019re making a lot more sense of it for everyone.\u201d \u2666"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/francesca-hayward-the-pick-of-the-litter-in-cats", "id": "34321d59-426f-3d06-9c04-3c8cbe67c095", "title": "Francesca Hayward, the Pick of the Litter in \u201cCats\u201d", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Tyler Foggatt", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "The source material, \u201cOld Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats,\u201d is a collection of poems that T.
