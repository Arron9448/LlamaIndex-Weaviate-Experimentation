Hall, who is thirty, is the singer and songwriter for Pinegrove, an indie-rock band that was then assembling an unusually zealous group of fans\u2014Pinenuts, they sometimes called themselves, with self-deprecating sincerity. There is something embarrassing about loving a band enough to give yourself a nickname, just as there is something embarrassing about singing earnest songs full of romantic complaints. \u201cJust trust me\u2014I mean it,\u201d Hall said, with a sheepish smile. Then he led his band through \u201cVisiting,\u201d which seems to chronicle a long-distance entanglement (\u201cI\u2019m spectral for days on end, these days / With thoughts about visiting\u201d), and which drives toward a fervent expression of confusion: But the truth is", "I don\u2019t know what", "I thought I knew it. Pinegrove turns lyrics such as these into rousing and sometimes twangy rock songs, which fail to be cool in two different ways: they are equally as likely to elicit cringes from listeners who value emotional restraint as they are from those who demand fashionable innovation. And yet Pinegrove harnesses, perhaps more effectively than any other band of its era, the power of a well-turned musical confession. This music fits, loosely, into the category of emo, which began, in the nineteen-eighties, as a passionate offshoot of hardcore punk, and expanded to include a universe of bands that were simultaneously scrappy and sentimental. In the two-thousands, \u201cemo\u201d often denoted angsty and theatrical hard-rock bands like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, which briefly dominated MTV and the nation\u2019s high schools. But by the twenty-tens, when Pinegrove emerged, there was no sense in worrying about who would be the next Fall Out Boy; with hip-hop ascendant and MTV essentially dead, it seemed clear that there wouldn\u2019t be one. The spirit of emo was instead nurtured online and at do-it-yourself house shows, where the financial stakes were low. Pinegrove built a following in basements\u2014first in Hall\u2019s home town of Montclair, New Jersey, and then farther afield. After a few years, Hall noticed that audiences were singing along. The band graduated from basements to clubs and got a contract with an independent record label, called Run for Cover. Pinegrove\u2019s breakthrough album, \u201cCardinal,\u201d released in 2016, contained \u201cVisiting\u201d and seven more songs that were similarly plaintive, and similarly addictive. By the time Hall played that festival in Michigan, the Pinegrove cult was growing both more obsessive and less exclusive. An article in Vice hailed \u201cCardinal\u201d as \u201ca perfect album.\u201d The band was selling out midsize clubs nationwide, playing shows that were starting to feel vaguely religious. Fans were getting Pinegrove tattoos\u2014often an outline of interlocking squares, like those on the cover of \u201cCardinal.\u201d (The actress Kristen Stewart has a Pinegrove tattoo.) After years of living with his parents, Hall had rented a house in rural upstate New York, with a big living room, where the band recorded an elegant and folksy new album, \u201cSkylight.\u201d Pinegrove seemed poised to enlarge its audience significantly, winning over grownup listeners who were drawn in by Hall\u2019s achy sincerity, even if they would never dream of attending a basement emo show. On November 21, 2017, about two months after the Michigan concert, Hall wrote a Facebook post that changed the way people viewed him and his music. He explained that he had been \u201caccused of sexual coercion,\u201d by a woman with whom he had had a brief relationship. His post contained nearly eight hundred words, but few details. The accusation itself was not made public, and neither was the identity of the accuser; Hall said that he was withholding the full story out of respect for her privacy. He did not admit or deny guilt, nor did he explain what \u201csexual coercion\u201d entailed, except in negative terms: \u201ci absolutely never threatened her, i never leveraged anything against her.\u201d Hall acknowledged his \u201cprivilege as a man\u201d and as a \u201crecognized performer,\u201d and wrote, \u201ci am so sorry.\u201d But his penitence seemed mixed with confusion, and perhaps frustration: i believed all of our decisions to be based in love. still, i am coming to terms with the fact that i monumentally misread the situation. i am trying earnestly to follow this line as deeply as it goes to reflect on all of the things i could have done, and can do, better. Hall announced that he would be \u201ctaking some time off.\u201d Pinegrove cancelled its upcoming tour dates and the planned release of \u201cSkylight,\u201d and Hall vanished from social media. A different kind of band might have had partisans rushing to defend their hero, but many Pinenuts, after registering their shock and anger, took a more ambivalent position, trying to balance their fandom with their concern for victims of sexual abuse. The power of Hall\u2019s music derived in part from his ability to persuade listeners to trust him. Just as hip-hop fans may expect their favorite rappers to be as tough as they say they are, many Pinenuts wanted Hall to be as thoughtful and sensitive as the narrator of the songs they loved. A few musicians from the scene condemned Hall\u2019s statement, or his character; one compared him to the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Many more were conspicuously silent. A fan posted a melancholy plea on Twitter: all I want for christmas is a clear understanding of the sexual coercion accusations toward evan stephens hall with considerate representation of the victim\u2019s voice and either a pinegrove reunion tour or a pinegrove tattoo removal kit dependent on aforementioned circumstances ok?", "In September, 2018, Hall resurfaced. He told the music site Pitchfork that, at the request of his accuser, he had gone a full year without touring. A couple of months later, the band launched a comeback tour, with a concert in Montclair and another in Brooklyn, where Hall only alluded to the topic on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cThis has been a really challenging year,\u201d he said. The band split with its label\u2014a mutual decision, both sides maintained\u2014and released \u201cSkylight\u201d independently. Online, plenty of people wondered why, in a world with no shortage of earnest indie bands, it made sense to support one with a singer accused of sexual misbehavior. But many Pinenuts returned, filling up bigger venues than ever before. Fans trying to sort out the ethics of supporting Pinegrove didn\u2019t have much to go on. The accuser had declined to comment to Pitchfork, but she had confirmed some details through an unnamed intermediary, who explained only that Hall had applied \u201cverbal and contextual pressure.\u201d In Hall\u2019s Facebook post, he had written, \u201ci have been flirtatious with fans and on a few occasions been intimate with people that i\u2019ve met on tour,\u201d adding that he had \u201creached the conclusion now that that\u2019s not ever appropriate.\u201d Some people assumed that the accusation had come from a fan. In fact, Hall\u2019s accuser had been on tour with Pinegrove as a member of the band\u2019s crew. Although she still wishes to remain anonymous, she told The New Yorker that she was willing to disclose her professional experience, to make clearer the pressure that she felt when she and Hall began their relationship. An indie tour can feel like a non-stop party, or like an extended road trip, but it is also a workplace\u2014albeit one with few written rules, and no distinct boundaries between personal and professional lives. She says that this atmosphere, combined with Hall\u2019s power as the leader of the band, gave rise to a romantic relationship that she now sees as implicitly manipulative. \u201cHe really had no control over me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, in the bubble of tour, I really felt like he did.\u201d The relationship ended soon after the tour, and she says that it took her a while to figure out that, even though there had been no violence in the relationship, she felt damaged by it\u2014and that she wanted Hall to take some time to reflect on the damage he had done. Hall, too, talks about the disorienting insularity of touring. He says that, in those early days, he didn\u2019t give much thought to the fact that the people on tour with him were in some sense his employees, not merely his friends. \u201cThe culture was really one of equality,\u201d he says. \u201cI perhaps na\u00efvely thought there was no power structure there.\u201d He still resists the idea that he was his accuser\u2019s boss, since at the time the band was not in a position to offer anyone a long-term job or even a living wage. Of course, the leader of a burgeoning band nevertheless wields plenty of influence, no matter how little money he makes. Every rock concert involves a power dynamic: even at an egalitarian basement show, a small number of people make most of the noise, and a larger number of people do most of the listening. Hall says that, as Pinegrove has grown, the band has developed \u201cmore self-aware professional practices,\u201d with \u201cmore clearly delineated boundaries\u201d; romantic relationships between band members and crew members are now \u201cemphatically discouraged.\u201d Cartoon by Kim Warp The rise of Pinegrove was a communal phenomenon, enabled by fans and fellow-musicians who became friends, all of them devoted to creating a world apart from the corporate music industry. But Hall\u2019s accuser says that, for her, this lack of structure posed a problem: she wishes that she\u2019d had access to the indie-tour equivalent of a human-resources department. \u201cI think that could have helped me at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cJust having someone that I know I could call.\u201d", "\u201cSkylight\u201d was essentially completed before the band disappeared; when Hall published the Facebook post, the label had already distributed advance copies for review. Now Pinegrove is releasing \u201cMarigold,\u201d the first album to reflect the band\u2019s changed circumstances. On a recent snowy afternoon upstate, Hall answered the door wearing a royal-blue cardigan and hand-painted Vans, and he talked readily but carefully about \u201cMarigold,\u201d which, he says, is the product of \u201ca period of intense self-reflection.\u201d Pinegrove\u2019s drummer, Zack Levine, was there, too. Levine lives down the road from Hall with his wife, Nandi Rose, a former Pinegrove member, who now leads her own band, Half Waif. Hall found emo relatively late in life. In high school, his favorite band was Radiohead, whose lyric sheets resemble postmodern collages. He started a grungy rock group with Levine, his childhood best friend. (Levine\u2019s father plays in a cover band with Hall\u2019s father, Doug, a commercial musician whose biggest hit is better known than any Pinegrove song: he wrote the infernally catchy comic-opera jingle for the financial-services company J. G. Wentworth.) Hall formed Pinegrove while studying at Kenyon College, in Ohio, and found himself drawn to richer melodies, cleaner guitars, and more forthright lyrics. Levine was a founding member, and so was his sibling, Nick Levine, whose pedal steel echoes the sorrowful sound of Hall\u2019s voice. Early on, Hall described Pinegrove as \u201clanguage-arts rock,\u201d but some of his most memorable lyrics were so matter-of-fact that they scarcely seemed to have been written at all: \u201cI saw Leah on the bus a few months ago / I saw some old friends at her funeral.\u201d He had no evident fear of sounding solipsistic\u2014a word that appears in the Pinegrove corpus\u2014or of issuing, from time to time, the kind of histrionic pronouncements commonly associated with teen-agers. (From \u201cAphasia,\u201d a crowd favorite: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have you by me / Then I\u2019ll go underground!\u201d) \u201cMarigold,\u201d to be released by the esteemed British label Rough Trade, is noticeably more stoic. Hall says that he wants to avoid the perception that he is seeking sympathy or luxuriating in self-pity. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve had plenty of emotions about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what my focus is as an artist.\u201d A singer known for sharing his feelings is trying to be more circumspect. One of the most arresting songs on the album is \u201cSpiral,\u201d which consists of thirty-two amphibrachs\u2014three-syllable lines, with the stress in the middle\u2014building toward an affirmation: Drink water", "Good posture", "Good lighting", "Good evening", "Good morning", "Good morning", "Good morning", "I see you. Hall is quick to remind people that his songs are not necessarily reflections of his own life. But on \u201cMarigold\u201d there are plenty of parallels. \u201cAlcove,\u201d which was inspired by a trip to California to see his extended family, is a message from a man heading into exile: \u201cI\u2019ll go if you want.\u201d The end of the album is anticlimactic\u2014the last song is \u201cNeighbor,\u201d an allegory about dead animals that sounds a bit like an undergraduate writing exercise, and it is followed by a meditative six-minute instrumental track, during which the band cycles slowly between chords. But \u201cThe Alarmist,\u201d a beautiful lament in 6/8 time, suggests that Hall has not, in fact, sworn off self-pity: It would be good to talk", "For my sanity", "Now do what you feel like you gotta do", "But be good to me. Hall spoke warmly of the musical community that once nurtured Pinegrove, but when asked whether he still felt like part of such a community he paused for a long while. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a question,\u201d he finally said. Eventually, he was saved by a scratching sound emanating from the kitchen. \u201cMaybe a mouse,\u201d Levine said. \u201cYeah, well, they\u2019re around,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt\u2019s cold outside. Let\u2019s let \u2019em in.\u201d"], "authors": ["Kelefa Sanneh", "Luke Mogelson", "Jia Tolentino", "Isaac Chotiner", "Alex Ross", "Erik Agard", "Masha Gessen", "Carrie Battan"], "keywords": ["halls", "songs", "complicated", "tour", "music", "hall", "band", "stages", "sexual", "comeback", "pinegrove", "album", "levine"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
