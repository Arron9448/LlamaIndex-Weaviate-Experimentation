By Edward White. W.W. Norton; 400 pages; $28.95 and \u00a322.99", "T HE PROFILE is unmistakable. A few lines establish nose, lip, regal forehead, modest hairline and the great round jowl. From behind this caricature Alfred Hitchcock emerged to introduce a weekly television show filled with the bizarre and the macabre. Yet if many people recognise the sketch, most won\u2019t know that he drew it himself. The author of his own mystique, Hitchcock was, says Edward White, \u201cnot just a film-maker but an impresario\u201d.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.", "He spent much of his time cultivating his brand. His mischievous face dominated promotional materials for \u201cPsycho\u201d and \u201cThe Birds\u201d. He talked up his own eye and disdained other directors. After meticulously preparing for shoots, he made a show of looking bored on set. Amid such gestures, the man himself recedes.", "Mr White\u2019s solution is to organise his chapters by topic, such as Hitchcock\u2019s religion, voyeurism, approach to women, connection to London and obsession with murder. Perceptive and gracefully written, \u201cThe Twelve Lives of Alfred Hitchcock\u201d is a bracing study of the master of suspense.", "The book is particularly astute on Hitchcock\u2019s relationships with screenwriters and actors. He had little use for the writers, redrafting whole scenes delivered by luminaries such as John Steinbeck. Hitchcock took inspiration less from a script than an idea or image\u2014a daring escape across Mount Rushmore, say, which became the climax of \u201cNorth by Northwest\u201d. Screenplays existed \u201cto heave the propeller of his imagination\u201d.", "Actors were a pricklier bunch. In one sense they were pure functionaries. (\u201cPlease start sweating now,\u201d he told one befuddled thespian.) Yet his stars were among the most glamorous figures of the golden age of Hollywood, and they drew Hitchcock into a vortex of envy and desire. He mistreated actresses on set, famously setting real creatures on Tippi Hedren in \u201cThe Birds\u201d. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct. Among leading men Hitchcock felt Cary Grant embodied his own aspirations to refinement and charm: Grant \u201cbecame an avatar for an inner Hitchcock that could not be outwardly expressed\u201d, writes Mr White.", "All because of his cursed heft, which Hitchcock bore like a child beating a bully to the punchline. He flaunted his appetite, then dieted ostentatiously. Yet he was sensitive about his appearance, and had a ham\u2019s need not just to hold the camera but to perform for it. The resulting exposure\u2014especially on \u201cAlfred Hitchcock Presents\u201d\u2014raised his profile but diluted his gravity.He saw himself as a Picasso; to others, he was as familiar as Mickey Mouse.", "Recently Picasso has prevailed. Since his death in 1980, Hitchcock\u2019s renown has grown alongside a rise in genre film-making by directors such as the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino. Mr White limits himself to biography and does not make a study of Hitchcock\u2019s 53 films (though he confides that \u201cRear Window\u201d is his favourite). An understandable decision\u2014but a shame all the same. It is a rare book that could pleasurably be twice as long. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["profile", "presenting", "elusive", "alfred", "genius", "picasso", "hitchcock", "hitchcocks", "women", "set", "mr", "white", "study"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
