He had a very real chance of succeeding George W Bush.", "Trump 'knew exactly what was going on' in Ukraine, says Giuliani associate Read more", "But Giuliani\u2019s campaign collapsed in chaotic fashion, and he became a political irrelevance \u2013 until re-emerging a decade later as Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, mouthpiece, bungling envoy to Ukraine and a central character in the third impeachment of an American president.", "It\u2019s hard to imagine now, but at the end of 2006, Giuliani was the most popular politician in the country. In March 2007, after Giuliani formally announced his White House campaign, he was the early favorite to win the Republican primary contest, with 44% support nationwide. (John McCain, the eventual nominee, was second with 20%.) Giuliani maintained that lead throughout the year, and raised the most money.", "Armed with a campaign slogan that read like the responses to a word-association examination \u2013 \u201cTested. Ready. Now\u201d \u2013 Giuliani seemed destined to represent the Republican party in the November 2008 election.", "\u201cWhen Rudy Giuliani entered the race he was seen as the frontrunner,\u201d said Capri Cafaro, a former minority leader of the Ohio senate and an adjunct professor at the American University school of public affairs. Oprah Winfrey had dubbed Giuliani \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d following the 9/11 attacks \u2013 a moniker that stuck \u2013 while Time magazine went further, naming Giuliani its person of the year for 2001 and branding him \u201cmayor of the world\u201d.", "Cafaro said: \u201cHis strength predominantly came from being seen as America\u2019s mayor \u2013 in light of this being just a few years after 9/11. [He was] playing to his strengths: his strengths in national security and essentially being able to rise to the occasion as a leader.\u201d", "Giuliani wasn\u2019t shy of leaning into that, which led to mockery as he launched his campaign.", "\u201cWhen he decided to run for president he was being laughed at by the late-night comedians for answering every question by mentioning 9/11,\u201d said Robert Polner, who covered Giuliani\u2019s mayoralty as a reporter for Newsday, and later edited a book on Giuliani: America\u2019s Mayor, America\u2019s President?", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Giuliani with Bush and fire commissioner Thomas Van Essen just after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Photograph: Doug Mills/AP", "It wasn\u2019t just late-night comics poking fun. Joe Biden, then running \u2013 for the second time \u2013 to be the Democratic nominee, mused of Giuliani: \u201cThere\u2019s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.\u201d The Onion ran a piece with the headline: \u201cGiuliani to run for president of 9/11\u201d.", "\u201cHe was still trying to ride his fame and convert that into primary votes,\u201d Polner said. \u201c[But] he had no real plan as to what he would do if he was president.\u201d", "Giuliani was still leading the polls in the summer of 2007, six months out from the first Republican vote in Iowa. But he hit an unexpected problem, in the form of a man dressed in a chicken suit \u2013 the \u201cIowa Chicken\u201d \u2013 who tirelessly followed Giuliani around in protest at him skipping the Ames straw poll, a traditional barometer of the Republican primary race.", "That wasn\u2019t the end of Giuliani\u2019s Iowa troubles. He decided, essentially, to skip the first state to vote and did not place much stock in second-to-vote New Hampshire. Instead Giuliani pinned his hopes on Florida.", "Many people saw this as a bad decision, including the Guardian\u2019s then Washington correspondent, Ewen MacAskill.", "\u201cHistory will show the unconventional, and ultimately catastrophic, strategy to be one of the biggest miscalculations in US campaign history,\u201d MacAskill wrote in 2008, as Giuliani\u2019s campaign collapsed around him. \u201cOne that has brought Giuliani\u2019s ambitions to be the 44th US president to a humiliating end.\u201d", "Giuliani\u2019s Florida gameplan was based on the idea that for some Republicans elsewhere, he just wasn\u2019t conservative enough. Giuliani, by this point, was on his third marriage \u2013 he has since completed his third divorce \u2013 and as mayor of New York had embraced positions that were anathema to socially conservative Republican supporters. In Florida, at least, there was a diaspora of ex-New Yorkers, and some supportive centrist primary voters.", "But his past might well have doomed him nationally.", "Cafaro said: \u201cOne of the reasons why he failed is not necessarily because he decided to focus on one or two major primaries, but because he was seen as being out of step with the values of the Republican primary voter.\u201d", "He said: \u201cAs someone who was pro-choice, and had been married three times, somebody who was from New York, somebody that was a little bit more lenient on some of the social issues, including civil unions for same-sex partnerships, so those things were not embraced in that primary. I think that\u2019s really what hurt him.\u201d", "Also stacked against Giuliani: his lack of focus. When he lost the 1989 election for New York mayor, Giuliani spent the next four years, according to Polner, \u201cmeeting with people, studying different aspects of the city, and preparing to become a politician\u201d. That period of reflection and strategizing worked \u2013 Giuliani defeated the Democrat David Dinkins in 1993 \u2013 but he failed to apply it in 2008.", "\u201cWhen he jumped in for president, it seemed more like impulse power, and he was just running on the fumes\u201d of being mayor on 9/11, Polner said.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest In this picture from October 2003, Giuliani supports Arnold Schwarzenegger in his bid to become California\u2019s governor. Photograph: Stephan Savoia/AP", "\u201cHe hadn\u2019t established a base or network of Republicans in key states, and he didn\u2019t have any well-developed positions on where he wanted to take the country or the party.\u201d", "People noticed. In the Iowa caucuses, on 3 January 2008, Giuliani came sixth out of seven candidates. It was no cause to panic \u2013 after all, he had all but ignored Iowa. But then came New Hampshire. Giuliani came fourth.", "The Florida primary, the key to Giuliani\u2019s grand plan, was on 29 January. He came a distant third. It was over. Giuliani threw in the towel the next day, and endorsed McCain.", "\u201cGiuliani has a history of kind of overestimating his political appeal, and also overreaching,\u201d Polner said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who really craves relevance and attention, and the media spotlight \u2013 and power really.\u201d", "Giuliani had got attention and the media spotlight, for a while, yet being America\u2019s mayor, being the mayor of the world, had counted for nought.
