She predicts rising demand for residential solar power \u2014 solar panels connected to home storage batteries. \u201cPeople love the idea of tracking their energy usage through an app, seeing how much they\u2019re saving,\u201d she says.", "The roof of this two-bedroom home on Bedarra Island, Queensland, is bedecked with solar panels. Perched on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, the property comes with a one-bedroom caretaker\u2019s residence, which uses 100 per cent solar power, and spring and captured rainwater. All could be yours for A$4.5m ($3.4m).", "Bigger screens", "The global pandemic\u2019s toll on cinemas in 2020 has led consumers to recreate the cinematic experience at home, according to Laurence Mitchell, head of technology at the UK department store John Lewis. He predicts strong demand for large 8k televisions and home cinema projectors, along with \u201ccrystal clear sound solutions\u201d.", "\u201cFor 2021, we expect this trend of 75-inch televisions \u2014 and larger \u2014 and 130-inch projectors to continue as customers transform their living spaces into \u2018at home\u2019 theatres,\u201d he says. With major sports events driving sales of large-screen displays, he predicts high demand for this year\u2019s rescheduled Olympics and European Football Championship.", "Mitchell also expects immersive entertainment to increase in popularity. Sales of the Oculus virtual reality headset were up 280 per cent in 2020 on the previous year. \u201cWe anticipate that this trend will continue in 2021 as more brands get on board,\u201d he says.", "This impressive Grade I-listed seven-bedroom house and mews in a sought-after John Nash-designed terrace by London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Park has an inviting media room, kitted out with a large-screen television by the current owners. The refurbished \u00a322.5m property also has excellent views of the park and a south-west facing garden.", "Wellness fixes", "The pandemic, and the shift to homeworking, has also escalated interest in health and wellbeing. Jan Vitrofsky, founder of HEDSouth, a US home integration company specialising in making properties \u201chealthier\u201d for their owners, expects no let up in demand this year for home wellness tech such as air purifiers and smart lighting.", "\u201cThe most important elements for a healthy home are fresh air, clean water, lighting that is in harmony with our body\u2019s circadian rhythm and comfort features such as temperature [control] and acoustical elements,\u201d he says.", "His company can install a whole-home wellness platform called Darwin, which automatically adjusts the intensity, colour and warmth of the lights according to the time of day \u201cto provide the most optimal environment for our bodies and minds\u201d.", "The new owners of this eight-bedroom contemporary mansion in Vero Beach, Florida, can adjust and control its lighting automatically.

Aylett says that while a wired network is the best solution, most of us use a wireless one. \u201cInvest in great WiFi and everything else comes together,\u201d he says.", "He says that WiFi 6E, the latest industry standard will offer \u201cfaster speeds, better roaming and more reliable performance when multiple devices are connected at the same time.\u201d Expect to see WiFi 6E products at CES and on sale throughout the year.", "The main building of this 10-bedroom villa was largely constructed in the 16th century, long before the advent of data networks, but there is scope to install a home data network.

A rollable TV would make a nice addition to the spacious master bedroom, where it could be retracted when the far-reaching views of the city are preferred.
