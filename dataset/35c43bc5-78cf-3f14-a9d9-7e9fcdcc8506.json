I have mastered the art of observing attainable, desirable aesthetic choices on others\u2014and taking absolutely zero action to apply them to myself. All of my makeup expired two years ago. My brushes are in desperate need of a wash, and instead of washing them I just refuse to use them. My foundation doesn\u2019t match my skin, because I bought it two summers ago, when I was tan, and I don\u2019t want to waste money ordering a new one, because I know I will somehow mess up and it too will be the wrong color for my unmatchable, sometimes red\u2013sometimes green skin tone. And no, I wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cjust return it,\u201d because I seem to have been born with an inability to return things.", "I exist in that sweet spot of desperately wanting to look good and not making any kind of real effort lest someone think I am trying to look good. Yet even I have picked up on the current fascination with Y2K\u2014that era of low-rise jeans, bedazzled tank tops, and lip gloss that is still haunting and humiliating to those of us who were actually cognizant in the early aughts\u2014and what is seemingly the makeup of the moment: It\u2019s black eyeliner. There\u2019s literally been no other option. But despite the lower half of our faces being covered for the last 12 months, there are other reasons I\u2019d like to suggest for why eyeliner remains the only thing we want to wear in the New Year. Yes, this is an entire essay about eyeliner. Don\u2019t blame me; blame society.", "The last time I was obsessed with eyeliner, it was a universal form of expression for us sad girls who didn\u2019t know who we were yet, or why we were so sad. My raccoon eyes, which I erratically traced with Urban Decay\u2019s 24/7 Glide-On Pencil in high school, had the ability to immediately inform strangers that I was annoyed and that I didn\u2019t like attention, even though I was simultaneously bringing attention to myself. Fast-forward to the hell that was 2020, and even a non\u2013beauty expert could have predicted that this punk-rock favorite would start to show up all over social media\u2014and the spring runways. I\u2019ve never seen a fashion show in my life, but I do scour the internet (see above), which is rich with references to makeup artist Peter Philips\u2019s strong and graphic black eyeliner at Christian Dior, and Pat McGrath\u2019s dramatic and sculptural wings at Chloe, not to mention her electroclash moment at Valentino. Because after getting through this last year, we\u2019re all punk rockers? (I\u2019m not confident enough about this last sentence to not put a question mark at the end of it, but I stand by it.)", "\u201cAncient cultures used black kajal and kohl for protection and as a statement of power,\u201d celebrity makeup artist Pati Dubroff says, explaining dark eyeliner\u2019s unique ability to convey our collective emotional state. \u201cWearing it now makes us feel as though we have power over the last year.\u201d It effectively translates our mood, she continues\u2014\u201cand it can create a character within a mood,\u201d confirms Daniel Parker. He would know; as the lead hair and makeup designer for Netflix\u2019s popular miniseries The Queen\u2019s Gambit, Parker used a variety of black eyeliners\u2014MAC\u2019s cult-\u00adfavorite Blacktrack Gel and Pencil in Smoulder, as well as liquid pens from brands such as Christian Dior, YSL Beauty, and Tom Ford\u2014to subliminally affect Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s onscreen evolution so you never once find yourself thinking, Hey, isn\u2019t it kind of weird that Beth Harmon puts on a winged eyeliner, every morning and night, to practice chess, alone? \u201cWhen she was a very young girl, the liner was small and timid and delicate,\u201d explains Parker. \u201cAs she moves on, it becomes longer and broader and definitely bolder, so you end up getting something very sophisticated.\u201d", "Black eyeliner riffs subliminally affect Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s onscreen evolution from timid young girl to empowered young woman in The Queen\u2019s Gambit.
