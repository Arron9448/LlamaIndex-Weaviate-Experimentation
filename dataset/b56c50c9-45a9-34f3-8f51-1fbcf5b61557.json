In 1390, Pierre d'Arcis, the bishop of Troyes, wrote to the Pope, declaring it a fake, designed to attract gullible tourists. Believers and skeptics have tussled over its origins ever since -- as the crowds continue to line up in Turin.", "With the discovery of the negative image, the stakes became even higher. Proponents of the Shroud still insist that the man in the image -- face swollen and bruised, hands and feet punctured by nails, and back scourged by Roman whips -- is Jesus Christ.", "Skeptics, however, say it's a clever medieval fake.", "Both sides claim they have evidence that backs them up and discount the research that points to the opposing view.", "Science should have had its final say in 1988, when radiocarbon dating established that the fabric of the shroud originated from 1260-1390AD.", "That should be case closed.", "But not only does the research into the Shroud continue; Christians and non-Christians alike continue to pile into Turin Cathedral to see the artifact.", "This holiest of destinations is one of Turin's top visitor attractions, along with the city's Cinema Museum MAU (alfresco urban art gallery) and PAV, an eco-themed garden and living art gallery, built over an old car factory.", "\"To go from navigating the bustling, modern urban center to suddenly finding yourself standing in silence before this ancient image of Our Lord... it gives an indescribable feeling of peace,\" says Father Francis Murphy, a Catholic priest from the UK.", "'Everyone wants to go'", "The lines are enormous when the Shroud is on display MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images", "\"If it's not already in the program, groups normally ask if they can go and see it,\" says Davide Cabodi , a Turin tour guide who takes visitors to see the Shroud most days.", "Not that they can see the Shroud itself.

Over two million people lined up to see the Shroud on that occasion.", "On an average year when the Shroud is not on display, around 200,000 people visit the chapel annually, says the cathedral, although it's hard to be precise with numbers.", "Its popularity shows no sign of waning, despite the radiocarbon dating -- and despite the Catholic Church's refusal to pronounce officially on the Shroud.", "\"Relics\" are artifacts that the Church believes to be real, but the Shroud is not classed as a relic.

And if you believe this is the shroud-wrapped body of Christ it has tremendous religious significance.\"", "French also points to the theory of \"contagion\" -- the idea that an object that has been in contact with a particular person can take on elements of their character. It's why we pay hundreds of dollars for an item owned by a pop star, and why nobody wants to live in the house of a murderer.", "By being close to something that might have touched the son of God is, for believers, a way of getting closer to divinity.", "French also says that \"the strongest cognitive bias is confirmation bias. We find it much easier to find evidence that supports what we want to be true.\" So seeing the Shroud, which appears to match wound for wound the descriptions of Jesus' crucifixion, it's human nature to want to believe.", "There might be another element to contagion.

He saw the VP8 3D images. He learned there was no \"directionality\" to the image, as one applied with a brush would have.
