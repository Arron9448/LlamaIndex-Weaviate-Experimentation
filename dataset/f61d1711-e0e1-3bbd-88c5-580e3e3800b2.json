But wait, there\u2019s scandal afoot! An anonymous newsletter is hellbent on chronicling all their misdeeds!", "When the trailer first came out in mid-December, some compared it to an old-timey Gossip Girl. And sure, there are some (albeit anachronistic) similarities. Each has an anonymous narrator, to start: Lady Whistledown, the pseudonymous writer of Bridgerton\u2019s tittle-tattle rag, is voiced by Julie Andrews, just as the CW\u2019s mysterious blogger had Kristen Bell as its narrator. But with Bridgerton, the persona of Lady Whistledown is actually taken from history itself.", "Yes: Regency, or late Georgian-era England, was booming with \u201cscandal sheets,\u201d or newspapers strongly focused on personalities and juicy stories. Multiple factors led to this golden age of gossip: In 1695, London got rid of their \u201cLicensing Act,\u201d which previously limited the number of printing presses that could exist. Then there was the shrinking importance of the monarchy. In 1688, parliament significantly limited the power of the king and his court. So by the 1700s, more people could print more things, and they could print them about powerful people to boot.", "Come the late 1790s and early 1800s, a few additional societal factors played a part: One, a massive population boom\u2014London went from under a million people in 1801 to around one and a quarter million in 1820. With that came a rise in crime, but also general debauchery like drinking and gambling. Two, there was a greater focus on arts and culture\u2014a lover of beautiful things, the Prince Regent spent lavishly on paintings, buildings, and public works. Suddenly you had an aesthetics-focused society with a seedy underbelly and a weakened monarchy. The final accelerator? Little to no libel laws and, in 1814, the arrival of the mass-producing, industrial printing press.", "So what did these gossip rags say? Let\u2019s examine some of the juicier entries. According to an article by Stella Tillyard in History Today, in 1769, various newspapers reported that \u201can assignation at the White at St. Albans between L\u2014G\u2014 and certain great D\u2014e, was disconcerted by the forcible intrusion of my lord\u2019s gentleman.\u201d This makes no sense to us now, but at the time, readers were used to public figures only being identified by their initials. \u201cReaders would easily have identified the great Duke as the King\u2019s brother the Duke of Cumberland, and his lover as the society beauty Lady Grosvenor, and looked forward with salacious anticipation to the next chapter,\u201d wrote Tilyard."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["gossip", "readers", "public", "whistledown", "print", "bridgerton", "regencyera", "reallife", "scandal", "printing", "things", "england", "lady", "society", "whistledowns"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
