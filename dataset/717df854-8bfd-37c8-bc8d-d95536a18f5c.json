Focussing on nine pivotal works, this study, equal parts musicological and biographical, complicates the simplistic portrait of Beethoven as an isolated, single-minded genius. Although he seemed inclined to rebellion and irreverence, he still relied upon a close circle of friends and patrons\u2014especially as he began to lose his hearing\u2014and saw his fortunes as bound up with theirs. His music also testifies to his political awareness. Tunbridge writes that \u201cFidelio,\u201d his only opera, \u201croots him as a man of his time rather than allowing him to float free of worldly concerns, a transcendent genius.\u201d", "The Light Ages, by Seb Falk (Norton). The figure at the heart of this exploration of medieval astronomers, philosophers, and physicians is John of Westwyk, a brilliant fourteenth-century Benedictine monk who created an equatorium, a kind of analog computer for determining the positions of the planets. As John passes in and out of the historical record, Falk provides an expansive survey of Eastern polymaths, squabbling theorists, political schemers, and optimistic overreachers. Those dreamers can be the most beguiling: the eleventh-century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury leaped from an abbey tower with wings attached to his hands and feet, flying two hundred metres before plunging to earth. Falk, always generous, applauds him for having \u201cpiloted an experimental glider, not wholly without success.\u201d", "A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself, by Peter Ho Davies (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). This semi-autobiographical novel relates the experiences of a father through two life-changing decisions\u2014to have a child, and not to have one\u2014which he comes to see as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d His wife\u2019s first pregnancy ends in a \u201cvirtuous abortion,\u201d after tests reveal fatal abnormalities. The couple grieve for years, even as the father frets over the ethics of a man\u2019s mourning a woman\u2019s abortion, particularly when the procedure is under attack. They eventually become parents to a boy who is later diagnosed as being \u201csomewhere on the spectrum.\u201d Davies treats twists of fate with clear-eyed realism, humor, and grace. \u201cAll these doubts and regrets,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd all\u2014miraculously, paradoxically\u2014worth it.\u201d", "Butter Honey Pig Bread, by Francesca Ekwuyasi (Arsenal Pulp). Spanning decades, this fast-paced d\u00e9but novel moves from Lagos to Montreal, Halifax, and London as it traces the sorrows and triumphs of a pair of estranged twin sisters and their troubled mother. The mother, seemingly schizophrenic, is in fact an ogbanje, a restless spirit believed by the Igbo to resist remaining in a human body. She struggles against the compulsion to return to her spirit kin, while the twins desperately try to shape happy, earthbound lives, despite childhood trauma and adult disappointments. The novel abounds with sex, death, and food\u2014whose preparation offers these characters catharsis, knowledge, and sometimes simply pleasure."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["book", "writes", "novel", "mother", "monk", "falk", "john", "political", "briefly", "noted", "spirit", "father", "reviews", "tunbridge"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
