Biden openly stated: \u201cI said, \u201cI'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars'...I looked at them and said: \u201cI'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it \u201clooked bad.\u201d5 Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did.", "President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong6, and that there was No Pressure.

Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being applied \u2014 not once! Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: \u201cNo quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.\u201d7", "The second claim, so-called \u201cObstruction of Congress,\u201d is preposterous and dangerous. House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation's history. Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over. As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: \u201cI can't emphasize this enough\u2026if you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the President for doing.\"", "Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening. Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227)8, and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat. You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it! You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016. So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes. You view democracy as your enemy!", "Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party's impeachment effort has been going on for two and a half years,9\" long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine.
