People are going to not go to games. They\u2019re not going to buy merchandise. They\u2019re not going to fill ballparks. And that\u2019s ultimately going to hurt the league itself, and that will depress the prices that these owners are going to be willing and able to pay to the ballplayers. If that was their reasoning, it was flawed, it\u2019s bad, and it will ultimately hurt them in the long run. Sports was supposed to be this refuge where people could gather and cheer on their teams, whether their local teams or if you\u2019ve got a favorite team from another city. And now you\u2019ve alienated your fan base, at least a portion of them. People are not very forgiving when something that they love as much as they do for being apolitical turns political. You saw these people burning jerseys and they hold grudges.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["theyre", "political", "league", "turns", "willing", "baseball", "tom", "bevan", "weighing", "teams", "ultimately", "love", "going", "hurt", "forgiving", "youve"], "pubDate": "2021-04-08T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
