{"pubDate": null, "title": "How Derren Brown Remade Mind Reading for Skeptics", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, when I was visiting London, a magician friend told me that I had to see the English mentalist Derren Brown, who was appearing in the West End, in his one-man show \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes.\u201d Brown had become famous for an astonishing ability to seemingly read the thoughts of his fellow-humans and to control their actions. In a series of TV specials, he\u2019d reinvented a waning branch of magic\u2014mentalism\u2014for a new generation, framing his feats as evidence not of psychic powers but of a cutting-edge knowledge of the mind and how to manipulate it. A few days later, I was sitting in a capacity audience at a theatre in Covent Garden. A slim, pale, vulpine man in his mid-thirties, with well-tended light-brown hair and a goatee, came onstage, dressed in a trim black suit and a black shirt. He looked more like the creative director of an advertising agency than like a mind reader, and seemed to take neither his spectators nor himself too seriously: when someone\u2019s cell phone went off, he gave a look of mock alarm and said, \u201cDon\u2019t answer it. It\u2019s very bad news.\u201d Beneath his genially impudent manner lurked a suggestion of preternatural self-assurance and even menace. Brown spent the next two and a half hours performing a series of increasingly inconceivable set pieces, organized around the theme of how susceptible we are to hidden influence. He gave demonstrations of subliminal persuasion, lie detection, instant trance induction, and mass hypnosis, as well as manipulation of his own mental state to control his response to pain. To show that participants were selected at random, he hurled a stuffed monkey into the auditorium, and whoever caught it would come up onstage. (You can see a later performance of the show on YouTube.) Early on, a woman in the audience was entrusted with a locked briefcase. For the finale, Brown held up a large envelope, which he said contained \u201ca prediction of the future, about the decisions that you\u2019re going to make\u201d; clipped the envelope to a metal stand at center stage, where it remained in full view; and summoned the woman back up. He then tossed that day\u2019s editions of ten assorted newspapers into the audience and asked her to pick someone who\u2019d caught one of them. Next, he gave her and other audience members a series of choices, through which, eventually, page 14 of the Daily Mail was torn into dozens of pieces, and the woman selected a single word on one of them: \u201cinfluences.\u201d Pointing out the number of papers he\u2019d tossed out and the approximate number of words in each one, Brown said, \u201cThat\u2019s 1.6 million different words that you had to choose from in this room, and you choose the word \u2018influences.\u2019 Is that fair?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cNo!\u201d Brown said in a stage whisper. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It is not fair. It is inevitable.\u201d He went over to the stand where he\u2019d left the envelope, opened it, and, giving the woman one end to hold, unfurled a long roll of paper that read, in large letters, \u201cInfluences.\u201d The audience gasped and started cheering. Brown held up a hand for quiet, saying, \u201cHold on a second. You\u2019re all intelligent people. You\u2019re going to be having a drink afterwards, or driving home, or up at four in the morning trying to work out how that worked. And you\u2019ll think, Maybe it didn\u2019t make any difference what she chose. Maybe all that happened is magic boy here switches a bit of paper at the end, hopes she goes for that word, or something. It\u2019s a comfortable thing to think. But here\u2019s the point: if that is what happened and it didn\u2019t matter what paper you chose or what page, and all that was rubbish, then that word \u2018influences\u2019 wouldn\u2019t really be on page 14 of today\u2019s Daily Mail. And it is.\u201d Brown unlocked the woman\u2019s briefcase and removed an envelope containing page 14 of that day\u2019s Mail, with the word \u201cinfluences\u201d circled in red. The audience roared and leaped to its feet. \u201cThank you all for coming\u2014good night!\u201d Brown said, taking a bow and starting to walk offstage. But then he paused and again signalled for quiet. He explained that he had been exposing us to secret messages and that it thus made no difference who got selected for the final trick\u2014anyone in the audience would have picked that word on that page of that paper. \u201cLet me tell you what I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been filming little bits from the wings, little clips of the show.\u201d There followed a montage of moments from that night, in which Brown gave verbal suggestions, sometimes via subtle mispronunciations or non sequiturs, that we had apparently absorbed subconsciously. In one clip, Brown set up a stunt that involved hammering a nail into his nasal cavity, saying, \u201cDo you hammer daily a number 14 mail into your head?\u201d In another, he explained, \u201cBecause of the sorts of unconscious behaviors that we unconsciously choose daily\u201d\u2014and here he turned to the camera and winked\u2014\u201cmale subjects tend to be . . .\u201d And in another he said, \u201cPain is a subjective thing, like when you\u2019re young and you tear around influences, and you cut yourself, and you don\u2019t really know that you\u2019re cut till you look down and see the blood.\u201d \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve been hearing without realizing you\u2019ve been hearing it,\u201d Brown announced triumphantly. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was the Daily Mail, that\u2019s why it was page 14, and that\u2019s why it was the word \u2018influences.\u2019 Thank you for your attention, thank you for coming out tonight, and thank you for playing. Good night!\u201d This is what Brown does best: he takes an effect from the mentalism repertoire and generates from it an escalating series of climaxes that forces you to rethink everything you\u2019ve just seen. Rather than diminish the mystery, Brown\u2019s revelation of his ostensible methods reasserts and deepens it. He has always maintained that he neither has nor believes in any kind of psychic power, and his emphasis on manipulating people with techniques from the outer frontiers of psychology gives an audience too sophisticated to believe in the paranormal something scientific-seeming to hold on to. Often, the explanations end up being even more perplexing than the feat itself. Whether one believes that he\u2019s actually doing what he claims or that he\u2019s simply cloaking sleight of hand and the like in brilliant theatrics, he seems to be drawing back the curtain and offering a glimpse into some uncanny realm. As Brown once told me, \u201cPeople feel that they understand something about what I\u2019m up to but not everything, which satisfies their rational side but leaves room for something more playful and subterranean.\u201d In the U.K., Brown has been a household name for nearly two decades, thanks to dozens of TV shows, several stage shows, two Olivier Awards, and a number of best-selling books. Despite various forays into the U.S., including an Off Broadway run and Netflix specials, he remains relatively unknown here, but now he is making his Broadway d\u00e9but, with the show \u201cSecret.\u201d One of the producers, Thomas Kail, who directed \u201cHamilton,\u201d told me that he\u2019d been obsessed with Brown for years. \u201cHe just kind of lifts you up and takes you away, showing you things that should not be, and yet they are,\u201d Kail said. \u201cHe tells you that it\u2019s not real, and then he does it.\u201d Kail\u2019s words reminded me of something that had happened after the London show I saw. I\u2019d been invited to say hello to Brown in his dressing room. Though clearly exhausted, he was courtly and chatty, but, as we talked, he sat down and started picking tiny shards of glass out of the sole of his foot. Earlier, he\u2019d done a routine that involved walking barefoot across a carpet of jagged broken bottles without bleeding or feeling pain. As I stood in his dressing room, I wondered whether these glass splinters were really from earlier or if he was just treating me to an extra layer of deception\u2014what magicians call a \u201cconvincer.\u201d Fourteen years later, I\u2019m still not sure.", "I met up with Brown again for breakfast one summer morning last year in Southend-on-Sea, a down-at-the-heels resort town about forty miles east of London. Southend\u2019s points of interest include the world\u2019s longest pleasure pier and the Cliffs Pavilion, a sixteen-hundred-seat theatre where Brown was performing the final shows of a tour of the U.K. and Ireland. I was waiting for him to join me on the patio of his hotel, above an esplanade with a view of the Thames Estuary, which, at low tide, amounted to a vast expanse of muck dotted with grounded boats. As I sipped a weak espresso, I noticed a lanky man with graying hair pass by, do a double take, and stop. \u201cAdam?\u201d he said, in a mildly disreputable English accent. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this. Good God, what are you doing here?\u201d I had no idea who he was, and as my mind frantically tried to place him I stammered something about being there for work, adding hopefully, \u201cAnd you?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m here for work, too, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he said, hovering over my table. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that Trump is coming to Southend as part of his visit\u2014he\u2019s being made an earl, in recompense for all he\u2019s done\u2014and I\u2019m here covering it for the New York Times.\u201d I stood up to discourage him from taking a seat, and he went on, \u201cHow did you make out with all those people, after I left you that night in New York? Did you go out for more drinks?\u201d Sensing my confusion, he gave me a wounded look and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d Just then, Brown emerged from the hotel, waved, and walked over to the table. This seemed to offend the man. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re having a private conversation, and it\u2019s extremely rude of you to listen in.\u201d \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s O.K.\u2014he\u2019s a friend,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to meet me, and\u2014\u201d At this point, Brown and the man looked at each other and started laughing. Brown introduced me to Michael Vine, who has been his manager since the start of his TV career. Vine left, and we sat down to order breakfast. I told Brown that I felt like one of the unwitting participants in his TV specials, who are often put through bewildering, elaborately constructed scenarios\u2014part social-science experiment, part con game\u2014designed to make them do things they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t, whether good (take a bullet for another person) or bad (push a man off a roof). He laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a classic hypnotic technique\u2014you induce confusion. You were so baffled by Michael that you were just trying to make sense of it, trying to find something that you could hang on to. And that makes you very responsive and suggestible.\u201d When Brown puts audience members into a trance, he often starts by introducing himself and then withdrawing his hand when they reach out to shake it. \u201cThey\u2019re coming up onstage and they\u2019re already a little bit baffled, looking for direction from me, and then when you drop something that\u2019s very automatic, like a handshake, it throws them into disarray,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen I interrupt the handshake, put my hand on their foreheads, and say, \u2018Look at me. Sleep. All the way down, all the way deep,\u2019 they just go with it.\u201d Brown is now forty-eight. Since the first time I saw him, he has got rid of his goatee and, after years of progressively more indisputable hair loss, has shaved his head. \u201cIt\u2019s such a relief not having to labor over the intricacies and subterfuges of styling thinning hair and just say fuck it,\u201d he told me. Brown\u2019s winsome air and even keel can make him hard to read, though he has a distinctive tell\u2014a kind of sudden myoclonic twitch of his head that he refers to as \u201cmy nod.\u201d It\u2019s the last vestige of a childhood plagued by involuntary tics, he told me, and indicates that he is feeling self-conscious, stressed, or anxious. Off the clock, Brown neither reads anyone\u2019s mind nor, despite being a world-class card magician, performs tricks of any kind. He finds it embarrassing. He seems milder than his suave and commanding stage self\u2014charming and scrupulously polite, with no aura of mystery or danger. Though watchful, he exudes no sense that he\u2019s scrutinizing your every unconscious action or trying to worm his way inside your head. He is articulate and erudite, and he speaks earnestly but with an undercurrent of amusement\u2014at himself and others\u2014that bubbles up to flavor the sincerity. When our food arrived, Brown, although he has eaten a light bulb onstage, found his poached egg and smoked haddock suspect. \u201cThis tastes very fishy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not good enough with fish to know, but it tastes\u2014how to put this?\u2014very \u2018of the sea.\u2019 Is that a good thing?\u201d For the next ten minutes or so, Brown alternated between forging ahead with his breakfast\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine\u201d\u2014and pausing, a look of skepticism on his face. \u201cI could just ask them to take it back, but that\u2019s a real insult, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very English situation.\u201d In the opening monologue of Brown\u2019s New York show, he says, \u201cMy story was that I had a secret, a big, dark secret I couldn\u2019t possibly tell anyone. . . . I presumed that I was gay when I was fifteen, but I didn\u2019t come out till I was thirty-one. Which is a very long time to be avoiding the subject of sex. No one must ever know. Which is silly, because when you do eventually come out you realize no one gives a fuck. Truly, nobody cares. Which is a little disappointing, something of an anticlimax. All the things about ourselves that we think are so terrible\u2014to other people, it\u2019s just a bit more information about us. We\u2019d worry a lot less about what other people think of us if we realized how seldom they do.\u201d Brown actually came out a bit later\u2014at the age of thirty-five to his friends and family, and publicly a year after. Since then, he has come to understand the toll of having kept that particular secret for so long. \u201cBefore coming out, you work\u2014unconsciously, but you work\u2014to sort of divert attention from those parts of yourself that you don\u2019t want to expose,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd even when all that\u2019s sorted out it doesn\u2019t take much to bring it all rushing back, particularly if you\u2019re a magician, because you\u2019re doing something fundamentally dishonest.\u201d The theme of Brown\u2019s show is that the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and how the world works distort our perception of reality. As a person, Brown may lament that human tendency; as a performer, he relies on it. To be distracted from what a magician is really up to, an audience has to believe the story that\u2019s unfolding. Brown\u2019s gift is for making that surface story believable and compelling. Though he\u2019s not the first mentalist to hint at scientific explanations for his abilities, what he has done better than anyone else in his profession is to turn the purported method into an observable drama. \u201cI remember that, whenever I saw mentalism, it was always about \u2018O.K., think of a word and write it down.\u2019 Now I write something down and turn it around. \u2018This is the word you were thinking of.\u2019 Bam! End of the trick,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe entire focus was on the revelation, and it always struck me as misplaced, because that\u2019s not the interesting part of the trick. The interesting part of the trick is, What are you doing to read that person\u2019s mind? So my contribution was to put more weight on the process, because\u2014dramatically and theatrically and intellectually and everything-ally\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\u201d", "Unlike most magicians, Brown wasn\u2019t obsessed with the craft and its niceties as a child. His parents gave him a magic set one Christmas, but he can\u2019t recall whether he ever performed any tricks. Born in 1971, Brown grew up in Purley, a town in South London, which he describes as \u201cthe epitome of middle-class suburbia.\u201d Brown\u2019s mother, a former wedding-dress model, worked as a medical receptionist. She doted on her son. Brown had cooler relations with his father, who was a swimming and water-polo coach at the local secondary school. \u201cHe was sporty and manly and didn\u2019t have a lot of education,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhile I was bright and precocious and not sporty and liked to play dress-up with my nan\u2019s scarves.\u201d At school, Brown got high grades without studying much, but he was ill at ease among his peers and was sometimes picked on. He spent most of his time alone, obsessively drawing, devising Lego creations, or talking to an imaginary friend, Hublar, for whom his mother would set a place at the dinner table. \u201cDerren was a complicated boy but just so lovely,\u201d his mother told me. \u201cWe were worried about him, because we thought he was quite lonely.\u201d Though neither of Brown\u2019s parents was religious, at the age of six he asked them if he could attend Bible classes. Later, he started going to church on his own, growing increasingly fervent. \u201cI would be the insufferable one who would sit you down and give you all the proof of why God exists\u2014a neat system that all makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cMy relationship with my father wasn\u2019t great, and there\u2019s God as this sort of father figure and the whole lovely network of certainties that comes with it. And, of course, as I got older there was the sexuality thing that I was hiding and not facing and hoping might go away. Having a big thing you can put up in front of you and say \u2018That\u2019s me\u2019 is a very handy tool.\u201d At school, Brown fell in with a group of kids known variously as the Music-School Gang and the Poof Gang. \u201cYou were ostracized if you were part of that nerdy group,\u201d he said. By the end of high school, other students had become more accepting, and Brown ingratiated himself with witty banter and by drawing caricatures of teachers. \u201cIt was all a bit much, born out of a desperate urge to impress, but the relief that I felt of not being trapped in that little group was immense,\u201d he said. Brown scored among the highest grades in the country on his English, Politics, and German A-levels, despite not reading any of the assigned books. \u201cI just got quite good at making it sound like I knew what I was talking about in essays,\u201d he said. After a gap year in Germany, Brown enrolled at the University of Bristol, to study German and law, and he took up ballroom dancing, which he had discovered abroad. (\u201cIt was an oddly cool thing in Bavaria.\u201d) He competed on the collegiate Latin dance circuit, winning several trophies for cha-cha before retiring. \u201cThe sad thing is, it kills your desire and ability to dance in any other situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI dread weddings.\u201d Still attending church and struggling to reconcile himself to his sexuality, Brown gravitated toward a group called Living Waters, which espoused a kind of gay conversion therapy based on Scripture, prayer, and a belief that male same-sex attraction stemmed from overcompensating for deficits in the father-son relationship. But, he said, \u201cat some point I sort of realized, Nobody\u2019s standing up there saying it\u2019s worked for them\u2014not really.\u201d During his first year at university, Brown saw a performance on campus by a hypnotist named Martin Taylor. In one routine, Taylor got a student to forget the number seven; when the student counted his fingers, he couldn\u2019t understand why he had eleven. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing out of amazement and disbelief and kind of empathizing with the confusion,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAlmost right away I decided, I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d He started amassing books on hypnotism and practicing on fellow-students. Soon he was performing on campus and at a nearby theatre. His mother recalled seeing one of those early shows. \u201cI was shaking, absolutely petrified,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept thinking, Oh, no. What if it doesn\u2019t work? But he was able to put people under in a split second, and everybody loved it. There was a woman who heckled him, but he handled it with aplomb.\u201d Another show was disrupted by a group of students from the university\u2019s Christian Union. \u201cThey were casting demons out, exorcising the process that was happening onstage,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd that began\u2014or, at least, fed into\u2014a process of starting to question all of that, too.\u201d After some reading and thought, he found that his faith \u201cstarted to fall apart and seem a bit silly,\u201d he said. \u201cI became very atheist, with all the fervor of the righteous.\u201d If Brown had a new religion, it was getting up in front of a crowd. \u201cIt would make me look and feel impressive, which I adored, and give me a feeling of control,\u201d he said. Alongside his study of hypnotism, Brown began to teach himself sleight-of-hand tricks with cards, and soon he was earning extra money by giving walk-around performances at local restaurants. As graduation approached, he nervously told his parents that, rather than become a lawyer, as had been the plan, he wanted to be a magician. \u201cWe said, \u2018Fine\u2014whatever makes you happy,\u2019 \u201d Brown\u2019s mother told me. \u201cI think he was quite surprised.\u201d After graduating, Brown stayed in Bristol. He went on housing assistance, moved into a tiny apartment, and eked out a living performing at restaurants. He claims never to have had any real ambition, but his mother remembers him telling her, \u201cMum, someday I\u2019m going to be a millionaire.\u201d His focus and intensity bordered on the fanatical. Brown\u2019s friend Peter Clifford, a magician and an actor, remembers spending nine hours with him working on various methods for one card routine. \u201cWe\u2019d work on something until I thought we\u2019d exhausted every possibility,\u201d Clifford told me. \u201cAnd Derren would then go off and refine it even more.\u201d Early on, Brown affected a showy persona: long hair, blousy white shirts with billowing sleeves, leather vests, velvet pants tucked into knee-high boots, and Byronic capes. As his act grew in sophistication, he realized that his appearance hadn\u2019t kept pace. He cut his hair, updated his wardrobe, and found that he was able to double his fees. He spent most of his twenties working the tables at a Turkish restaurant in Bristol, creating a signature style that blended urbane cheekiness with serious intention. Whether revealing that a man\u2019s watch had vanished off his wrist and wound up in Brown\u2019s sock, causing a woman\u2019s wedding ring to float above his outstretched hand, or making a playing card dissolve into a shower of rose petals, Brown created effects that engaged his spectators emotionally and put more emphasis on their reactions than on his abilities. Over time, Brown found himself more and more drawn to mentalism and started developing his credo of letting audiences see what the process of mind reading looked like in action. He got his break in 1999, when he received a call from Michael Vine\u2014the man who fooled me at the hotel in Southend. A magician and juggler turned talent manager, Vine had formed a TV production company with an actor and comedian, Andrew O\u2019Connor. The pair told Brown that they were looking for a mentalist to front a new show on Channel 4. O\u2019Connor remembers that Brown seemed completely uninterested, but they persuaded him to come to London for a meeting.", "Mentalism differs from other magic in a significant way: no one believes that it\u2019s truly possible to overcome the laws of physics and, say, make a leopard vanish from a cage, but lots of people believe that it\u2019s possible to divine someone\u2019s thoughts, to see the future, or to communicate with the dead. Hunger for proof of a world beyond our own fuelled the rise of spiritualism in the mid-nineteenth century, and then the birth of mentalism as a form of popular entertainment. Early performers, such as the Fox sisters and the Davenport brothers, sought to pass themselves off as genuinely psychic, but, among the famous stage mentalists of the twentieth century, any claim to supernatural powers was generally soft-pedalled. Joseph Dunninger worked to debunk fake mediums; Chan Canasta and David Berglas were both coy about whether their \u201cexperiments\u201d were genuine or mere trickery; the Amazing Kreskin calls himself simply \u201can entertainer.\u201d \u201cGo on without me\u2014I\u2019ll never make it.\u201d Cartoon by Carolita Johnson After Kreskin\u2019s heyday, in the nineteen-seventies, mentalism\u2019s popularity went into decline, and by the mid-nineties Vine thought that it was overdue for a comeback. He and O\u2019Connor had noted how the American illusionist David Blaine had made magic feel more contemporary and cool. O\u2019Connor went to Channel 4\u2019s head of entertainment and asked, \u201cIf I could find you a mind-reading David Blaine, would you buy that?\u201d Vine and O\u2019Connor got the go-ahead, but finding the right mind reader proved to be a challenge, and they spent two years auditioning candidates from all over the world. The only one who felt right was Andy Nyman, an actor who supported himself between gigs by performing mentalism; he turned them down, because he wanted to focus on his acting career, but he agreed to work on the show behind the scenes if it ever went into production. Vine and O\u2019Connor were about to give up when someone Vine managed suggested that they consider his friend Derren Brown. When Brown came to London to meet Vine and O\u2019Connor, they took him to dinner, and, once the check had been paid, he said, \u201cWould you like me to show you something?\u201d After lighting a cigarette, he spread out a deck of cards and asked O\u2019Connor to remember one of them and to repeat it over and over in his head. First, Brown named the card O\u2019Connor was thinking of; next, he demonstrated that the card O\u2019Connor had chosen wasn\u2019t in the deck; finally, starting to cough, he revealed that the cigarette in his mouth had transformed into O\u2019Connor\u2019s card, rolled up and smoldering. \u201cIt was like the ground opened up and swallowed me,\u201d O\u2019Connor recalled. \u201cMind Control,\u201d the show that Nyman, O\u2019Connor, and Brown devised\u2014they have since collaborated on nearly all of the stage shows\u2014d\u00e9buted at the end of 2000 and quickly generated buzz. Brown\u2019s approach caught a moment: neuroscience, \u201cmind-hacking,\u201d evolutionary psychology, and neurolinguistic programming were in the air. His explanations for his feats allowed him to slip under the radar of viewers\u2019 skepticism, tapping into technocratic belief systems in order to produce a deeper credulity. \u201cMind Control\u201d and its sequels borrowed the fragmented structure of Blaine\u2019s street-magic specials, following Brown around as he performed such feats as subliminally influencing a betting-window cashier at a dog track to pay out on a losing ticket and convincing dancers in a night club that they\u2019d been touched by invisible hands. His breakthrough came with his 2003 special, \u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d during which he performed the game of chance on live TV, generating headlines and controversy while earning a reputation as a kind of bad boy with extraordinary powers. O\u2019Connor recalled, \u201cMichael Vine would literally get calls from people going, \u2018We are pitching to a government, we\u2019re bidding for a billion-dollar contract, and if Derren will come to the meeting and use his techniques, if we\u2019re successful, we\u2019ll give him a million dollars.\u2019 \u201d Vine would try to explain that it didn\u2019t really work like that, just as a magician who puts a woman in a box stage left and has her walk out of a box stage right may not actually be able to render air travel obsolete. O\u2019Connor went on, \u201cThey\u2019d go, \u2018Oh, of course that\u2019s silly, but can he please come to the meeting and influence the people so that we can get the contract?\u2019 \u201d As his act has evolved, Brown has gradually tempered his claims about psychological manipulation. These days, he says that he uses a combination of \u201cmagic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection, and showmanship,\u201d not to mention \u201cthe power of the well-placed lie.\u201d But he still regularly has to disabuse people of their belief in him. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of people that think that I\u2019m genuinely psychic and just won\u2019t admit to it,\u201d he told me. He cited a moment after a show in which he announced that there was no such thing as spirit mediums and then went on to tell people impossibly specific details about their dead relatives, all the while assuring them that the whole thing was bullshit. \u201cI went out to sign autographs at the stage door, and a girl said, \u2018My grandmother died recently. Can you put me in touch with her?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you realize what I was doing wasn\u2019t real. I wasn\u2019t actually doing it.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Oh, no, no, no, I know you\u2019re not really doing it, but are you able to put me in touch with her?\u2019 \u201d", "Brown lives in a four-story town house in London, with his boyfriend of almost four years. He asked me not to identify the exact neighborhood, or his boyfriend\u2019s name and occupation, because of stalkers. Early in Brown\u2019s career, a woman became convinced that she was married to him and turned up one afternoon at his mother\u2019s door to complain that he was an abusive husband. Not long before, Brown had come out to his mother. \u201cIt was a very confusing day for my mum,\u201d he told me. His house is decorated with leather club chairs, paintings, photographs, marble busts, magic memorabilia, bookshelves with secret doors built into them, and a large and lovingly curated collection of taxidermy. Brown has been a collector since he first started making money. (He\u2019s at pains to stress that he buys only animals that died of natural causes.) He used to be a regular presence at auctions, becoming well known in taxidermy circles, though now he mostly fields e-mail inquiries from dealers. When I first walked in, a giraffe (from the neck up), a swan, and the mounted head of a unicorn seemed to give me the eye. A pair of stuffed dogs and a dog bed off to one side struck me as a nice touch, but then two dogs who were very much alive\u2014Doodle, a beagle mix, and Humbug, a Tibetan terrier\u2014ran in. A parrot flew into the room, past a taxidermied piglet with wings that was suspended from the ceiling, and alighted on Brown\u2019s outstretched finger. This was evidently an everyday domestic scene, but the moment had a disorienting, shivery vibe that felt very Derren Brown. He told me, \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in creating things that look and feel kind of real, and I love the idea of people not being quite sure how real what they\u2019re seeing is.\u201d At home, Brown likes to relax by painting (he\u2019s had a number of gallery shows) and cooking elaborate meals. On tour, he spends his days wandering with a Leica through whatever city he\u2019s in, shooting street scenes, or in caf\u00e9s writing. He published his first book for the conjuring community in 2000, and a second the next year. He has also published three books for the general public: a look at the quirks of human cognition; a memoir built around the card routines he performed in his pre-fame days; and \u201cHappy: Why More or Less Everything Is Absolutely Fine,\u201d a survey of Stoic philosophy and how it applies to the way we live now. By Brown\u2019s reckoning, writing \u201cHappy\u201d helped him move through his own life with more equanimity, and many of the tenets of Stoicism\u2014that we are disturbed not by what happens to us but by how we react to what happens, that we should let go of the things we can\u2019t control\u2014have found their way into his performances. Brown is starting to plan a follow-up to \u201cHappy,\u201d which he thinks may focus on the tension between our relationships with other people and our need for self-realization. Whether listening to a partner vent frustrations or performing mentalism for a theatre full of strangers, the secret, he believes, is to take the focus off ourselves and make the moment about the other person or people. \u201cEmerson made the comment \u2018My giant goes with me wherever I go,\u2019 \u201d Brown said. \u201cI really love that image of this sort of big lumbering giant standing behind us. Not just because I have one myself but because everyone has one. And it is the things that we feel separate us, our own insecurities, that generally turn out to be the things that connect us, because they\u2019re the very things that we share. Which is how a psychic can so easily sound like she knows about you, or an author can essentially be writing about himself, but it feels as if he\u2019s writing about you.\u201d When I had dinner with Brown and his boyfriend at an outdoor table at their local Italian restaurant on a warm summer night, the conversation turned again to relationships and the consolation of philosophy. Brown told me that when a former partner broke up with him in 2014, after seven years together, he had been in the middle of writing \u201cHappy\u201d and was steeped in the Stoic mind-set, which seemed to cushion the blow. \u201cThe breakup was relatively amicable and light and easy,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd I remember feeling quite proud that I\u2019d dealt with it all extremely well.\u201d A few months later, though, when a guy he\u2019d met on Tinder broke things off, Brown, as he put it, \u201ctotally went to pieces.\u201d For a long time, he remained puzzled by his reaction. \u201cI fell apart over the little breakup that followed the big breakup, totally out of proportion to what it was\u2014a decidedly un-Stoic response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve thought about it since, and it makes sense. It\u2019s the bit that takes you by surprise when you\u2019ve dealt with this thing over here and put all your attention on that, and then something else sneaks in from the outside.\u201d A thought seemed to occur to him, and he added, \u201cWhich is kind of what I spend my life doing.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/07/how-derren-brown-remade-mind-reading-for-skeptics", "keywords": ["brown", "mind", "went", "vine", "browns", "remade", "hes", "reading", "audience", "told", "thats", "derren", "thing", "skeptics", "oconnor"], "summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to meet me, and\u2014\u201d At this point, Brown and the man looked at each other and started laughing.\nOff the clock, Brown neither reads anyone\u2019s mind nor, despite being a world-class card magician, performs tricks of any kind.\nThe pair told Brown that they were looking for a mentalist to front a new show on Channel 4.\nVine and O\u2019Connor were about to give up when someone Vine managed suggested that they consider his friend Derren Brown.\nThis was evidently an everyday domestic scene, but the moment had a disorienting, shivery vibe that felt very Derren Brown.", "authors": ["Adam Green", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Mark Singer"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "c105276f-f7c4-3043-85a9-b5244a03ccb4"}
