Move Fast", "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d", "pubDate": null, "paragraphs": ["For many Americans, New Year\u2019s Day means a new set of resolutions, a slight headache, and a refreshing tabula rasa. At Tesla, the electric vehicle maker, January 1, 2020 will mark something else: the official end of its vehicles\u2019 eligibility for federal tax credits. For the first time since 2009, new Tesla buyers won\u2019t receive a little extra incentive from the American government to buy the company's electric cars.", "The phaseout of the tax credit has long been planned. Here\u2019s how it works: Each automaker is eligible for $7,500 in credits for each electric vehicle sold, up to 200,000 sales. Six months after hitting that target, the tax credit gets halved, to $3,750, for six months, then halved again, to $1,875, for another six. After that, the credit goes to zero. Tesla hit the 200,000 mark halfway through 2018, and General Motors hit it one fiscal quarter later.", "Want the latest news on electric cars in your inbox?

That failed this week, when Congress agreed on a budget that did not extend the program. One proposal, from Senator Debbie Stabenow, the Democrat of Michigan, would have raised the number of EV sales eligible for the credit to 600,000 and reduced the starting credit slightly, to $7,000. Now Tesla\u2019s out of credits, GM will be there soon, and other automakers\u2014notably Nissan and Ford, which as of this summer were 48,000 and 86,000 EV sales, respectively, away from the 200,000 target\u2014are closing in.", "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, General Motors spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan called the failure to extend the tax credit a \u201cmissed opportunity to further advance electrification in the US.\u201d", "Legislators' refusal to extend the credits doesn\u2019t spell doom for the electric vehicle market. Tesla said in a financial filing last year that the company doesn\u2019t believe the credit phaseout will affect sales \u201cin the long run ... as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives.\u201d Some argue that the credits worked as intended; they made electric vehicles more cost-competitive with gas-guzzling ones, at least long enough to get the nascent tech rolling out of dealer lots. And because electric vehicle purchasers have so far been wealthier than the average American driver, critics have argued that the credits are a waste of federal money. The program has been relatively popular: Between 2014 and 2018, US buyers claimed credits for 239,422 vehicles, worth $1.4 billion, according to the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.", "Still, electric vehicles have a ways to go: Just over 2 percent of American vehicles sold last year were electric. Losing the federal tax credits may make their road to the mainstream bumpier.", "What's more, losing access to the federal tax credit may also imperil automakers' ability to meet state \u201czero emissions vehicle\u201d targets. That program requires anyone selling cars in California and 14 other states to sell a specified number of electric vehicles, or to purchase \u201cZEV credits\u201d from another manufacturer, like Tesla, that has hit its electric target. The state program \u201cis a big driver of electric vehicle sales,\u201d says Jeremy Michalek, a professor of engineering who studies EV policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Without the credit boost, hitting electric vehicle targets might get harder."], "keywords": ["buying", "credits", "credit", "electric", "tax", "federal", "tesla", "vehicles", "program", "fast", "sales", "vehicle"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Aarian Marshal"], "summary": "At Tesla, the electric vehicle maker, January 1, 2020 will mark something else: the official end of its vehicles\u2019 eligibility for federal tax credits.\nSix months after hitting that target, the tax credit gets halved, to $3,750, for six months, then halved again, to $1,875, for another six.\nStill, electric vehicles have a ways to go: Just over 2 percent of American vehicles sold last year were electric.\nWhat's more, losing access to the federal tax credit may also imperil automakers' ability to meet state \u201czero emissions vehicle\u201d targets.\nWithout the credit boost, hitting electric vehicle targets might get harder."}
