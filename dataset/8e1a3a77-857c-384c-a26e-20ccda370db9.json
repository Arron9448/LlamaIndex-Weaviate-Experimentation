I was going to shave my head and take a shower.\u201d \u201cWait, what?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually about to pull up to the mosque.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to get breakfast right now, but I\u2019ll text you later.\u201d \u201cOh, OK, yeah.\u201d \u201cOK, bye.\u201d \u201cBye.\u201d \u201cAdi\u00f3s.\u201d \u201cWhat about you? What\u2019s going on in your life, man?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m good, you know, working, figuring it out.\u201d \u201cLike you\u2019re always doing something film-related, right?\u201d \u201cTrying to, yeah. How are you? How\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just freakin\u2019 working at this restaurant job, trying to fix my back so I can start dancing 100 percent.\u201d \u201d(SINGING) Don\u2019t need no introduction, I\u2019m a fool.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s, like, a really slow, arduous process.\u201d \u201cHonestly, eighth grade Fahad confidence is unmatchable, dude.\u201d \u201cDo you think you peaked in eighth grade?\u201d \u201cMaybe not eighth grade, maybe \u2014 maybe close to it, though, maybe ninth grade. How were you in eighth grade? Like, how did you feel?\u201d \u201cI was in my whole Warped Tour scene phase.\u201d \u201d(SINGING) Cock it and pull it.\u201d \u201cI remember people were always like, you\u2019re the coolest Asian I know.\u201d \u201cDude, I clearly remember that. Someone told me, like \u2014 said you\u2019re the hottest Indian guy she\u2019s ever met. I felt so happy to hear that, but I was like, oh, that\u2019s ... Like, yeah, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhat do you miss most about that time?\u201d \u201cRiding the bus.\u201d \u201cOh my God.\u201d \u201cIt was definitely not your ordinary bus, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \u201c40 or 50\u201d \u201cKids from all different backgrounds.\u201d Raising hell.\u201d \u201cCompletely unsupervised, crazy ... going on.\u201d \u201cHella loud.\u201d \u201cBloody knuckles.\u201d \u201cGetting hyphy.\u201d \u201cBorderline P.D.A.\u201d \u201cPissing in a soda and stuff.\u201d \u201cThis is a public zoo.\u201d \u201cBody shots.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no keeping it clean.\u201d \u201cI remember trying to make a scene or something.\u201d \u201cDo you remember this guy named ... ?\u201d \u201cAnd I announced to the bus \u2014\u201d \u201cHe was kind of an ... \u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to snort this whole handful of sugar.\u201d \u201cHe, like, put me in a headlock.\u201d \u201cAnd then I literally snorted that whole thing.\u201d \u201cI just punched him right in the face.\u201d \u201cI remember walking home hella proud with this sugar drip going down my nose.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, what the ... dude? And I was like, you what the ... man!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember how people reacted.\u201d \u201cNot chill at all.\u201d \u201cYeah, like, I was honestly really weird back then, like I was always trying to, like, put on for people.\u201d \u201cYeah, but it was also like, we were 13.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. Times are different now.\u201d \u201cHow do you feel about growing older, like, is adulthood what you expected it to be?\u201d \u201cUhhhhh.\u201d \u201cDefinitely not. There are some aspects of my life where I feel like I have not grown up, and everyone else has. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense. I\u2019ve been thinking about how my parents immigrated to America when they were 26.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d \u201cI turn 26 next week, and I feel like I\u2019m still figuring out who I am.\u201d \u201cI think one of the things that I realized is that you\u2019re always figuring it out. I was talking to my dad about this the other day too. He had me when he was 30 years old. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be ready to have a kid at 30. I have no idea, like, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting flipping through the yearbook, and like, half these people are married now. People we knew, like, had kids. And I\u2019m just like, when did that happen?\u201d \u201cAnd then I\u2019m like, damn, I\u2019m just over here, working at a restaurant and convincing myself I can make it as an artist. That sounded kind of depressing.\u201d \u201cI definitely see parts of myself in my mom and in my dad. But I also think that it\u2019s hard for children of immigrants to 100 percent feel like their parents.\u201d \u201cI have these dreams and ambitions, but there\u2019s always a little bit of fear that I\u2019m always like, what if it doesn\u2019t work out?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cThe struggles that we go through are completely different from the troubles they go through.\u201d \u201cFrom a different perspective, I already have everything made.\u201d \u201cTheir life was also way more innocent back than too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m alive. I have the privilege to pursue my passion, you know?\u201d \u201cIf they went to something like a rave, they would have lost their minds.\u201d \u201cSo, in that sense, I\u2019m actually pretty happy. I\u2019m already living the American dream. But yeah, sometimes I\u2019ll just like, get in in my head about that. That\u2019s life, I guess.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] \u201cFlipping through the yearbook is such a crazy time capsule.\u201d \u201cYeah, I honestly hella miss that time.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have any perspective on how quickly your life moves until after it\u2019s passed you by, right?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cSo who knows? Like, when we\u2019re in their 40s, we\u2019re going to look back at 25 years old. And we\u2019re going to be like, I\u2019m still a boss, dude.\u201d [LAUGHTER] \u201cI\u2019m a boss, still that cool. Anyway, I\u2019m going to go pick up my coffee, but I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d \u201cYeah, thanks. Thanks for the call.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d \u201cOK, sounds good. Have a good day, bro.\u201d \u201cYeah, have a good summer.\u201d \u201cPeace.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sean Wang"], "keywords": ["grade", "middle", "eighth", "going", "life", "im", "hello", "dude", "school", "learned", "remember", "dont", "reopened", "yeah", "opinion", "yearbook"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
