Then in January, as LA become one of the worst Covid hotspots in the nation, Oil Can Harry\u2019s, a beloved gay country bar in Studio City, said it was closing for good after half a century of hosting queer line dancing.", "\u201cIt feels like a death,\u201d said Rick Dominguez, a DJ who hosted disco and country nights at Oil Can Harry\u2019s for 27 years. \u201cWe are losing a lot more than just our place to dance. It was a home for us for decades. So many people met and fell in love at Oil Can.\u201d", "Rick Dominguez, back row, second from left, was part of the dance group LA Wranglers that performed at Oil Can Harry\u2019s in 2012. The bar closed permanently in January. Photograph: Courtesy Rick Dominguez", "Oil Can still had a siren on site that staff used in the 60s to warn customers that police were coming and allowed them to quickly switch to partners of the opposite gender, said Dominguez: \u201cNew generations aren\u2019t going to get to know this space.\u201d", "Before Covid, gay bars were already disappearing in LA and other US cities due to rising rents and gentrification, and as online queer dating and hookup apps grew in popularity. The venues most at risk of closing are often independently owned and cater to more underrepresented groups, including Black and Latino communities, trans and gender-nonconforming crowds and working-class neighborhoods, research has shown.", "Many of the LA bars that are struggling are located outside of the West Hollywood scene, which is known for catering to white gay male crowds and is more touristy, with owners turning to GoFundMe to make it through the crisis.", "\u201cThese places were our safe havens, so to watch them be the first to go is really fucked up,\u201d said Meatball, an LA drag queen who performed at Precinct, a downtown club that is raising funds to stay open. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a world without Precinct. There are people who you only see there, but they are your close friends.\u201d", "Precinct has long had an unpretentious vibe that made it more comfortable than many gay bars, Meatball said: \u201cIt\u2019s dingy, it smells like old alcohol when you walk in, and there\u2019s something so comforting about this dark, seedy place \u2013 gay people love that stuff.\u201d", "New Jalisco, also in downtown, is one of the longest-running Latino gay bars in the region, run by an immigrant couple who transformed it into an LGBTQ+ venue in the 1990s. Behind on a year\u2019s worth of rent, the bar has also started raising funds.", "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a world without Precinct,\u201d said Meatball, a drag queen who performed at the club. \u201cThese places were our safe havens.\u201d Photograph: Jeremy Lucido", "\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re at a family party,\u201d said Eddy Francisco Alvarez Jr, a Chicana and Chicano studies professor at Cal State Fullerton. Alvarez noted that bars like New Jalisco are much more welcoming to undocumented patrons and trans Latinas than West Hollywood establishments. \u201cYou can show up in the multiplicity of who you are versus some other spaces that are very white or feel uninviting to working-class folks \u2026 We lose pieces of queer Latinx history when these places shut down.\u201d", "Don Godoy, who ran a weekly night at Jalisco called Kafe Con Leche, said that his dancers have relied on online events and OnlyFans to supplement their income, but that they were anxious to get back to in-person performances.", "\u201cWe had customers who came every week for three years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor it to stop all the sudden was challenging, especially mentally.\u201d", "\u2018We are resilient\u2019", "Club owners said they felt initially ashamed to ask for donations, but that they ran out of options.", "\u201cWe were paying the department of water and power to keep the lights on,\u201d said Scott Craig, co-owner of Akbar in Silver Lake, which opened in 1996. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pay our mortgage, our licenses, our property taxes \u2026 and what does it behoove us if we don\u2019t know what the hell we\u2019re going to do?\u201d", "Some of the Akbar owners\u2019 younger friends and longtime patrons eventually convinced them to try crowdfunding before selling their property and closing down, said Peter Alexander, co-owner: \u201cIt\u2019s much more important than my own personal financial wellbeing \u2013 all these places are more than just gay bars. They are our homes, our living rooms, our extended bedrooms.\u201d", "The Akbar GoFundMe went viral in December, securing the owners more than $230,000 in donations. The success of the campaign energized other queer bars to try to seek aid from supporters, though some say their debts are still significantly greater than the donations they\u2019ve gathered.", "Oliver Alpuche, owner of Redline, a downtown gay bar, estimated that the pandemic has left him with nearly $400,000 of debt, in part because he has had to continue paying for licenses and permits. He tried to do a few food pop-ups, but every effort at partially reopening has resulted in further losses. His landlord hasn\u2019t sent eviction notices, but has not allowed for any leniency either, he said.", "Tony Soto, who performs at Akbar, says he\u2019s hopeful that bars will survive the pandemic. Photograph: Paul Brickman", "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to ask a community that\u2019s already vulnerable and suffering to help us out,\u201d said Alpuche, whose GoFundMe is less than halfway to its goal. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have investors or resources to lean on. How many loans can I personally take out to survive this?\u201d The bar will probably continue to lose money when it returns with reduced capacity, he said: \u201cBut we\u2019re still fighting and we\u2019re gonna reopen.\u201d", "For the performers and gig workers who relied on gay bars to make ends meet, their return can\u2019t come soon enough.", "Ricardo Sebastian, who ran Puter\u00eda, a popular Latin party at Precinct, said the dancers, DJs, photographers, decorators and other workers behind the events have all been suffering. This moment, he added, reminded him of the Aids crisis when gay clubs became a ghost town until they eventually bounced back in the 90s: \u201cThis just reset everything \u2026 I know we\u2019ll come back. We\u2019re just resilient enough. But I think it\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d", "Tony Soto, a drag queen who performs at Akbar and Precinct, said some performers gave up and fled LA during the pandemic, but he was hopeful that the bars that have survived would draw big crowds once it was safe: \u201cWe are social animals, we need to be around each other \u2026 Once the vaccine is distributed, I think people are gonna be spitting in each other\u2019s mouths, and quite frankly I can\u2019t say that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d", "He has been doing weekly shows on Zoom, but was desperate to be in the same room as his audience again: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard real applause and real laughter in over a year.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "keywords": ["bar", "bars", "fight", "stay", "la", "afloat", "queer", "homes", "akbar", "shutdown", "pandemic", "places", "owners", "gay", "precinct"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
