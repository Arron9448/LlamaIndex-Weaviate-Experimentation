So there's very little coral bleaching.", "\"The biomass of fish underneath the sea is incredible. At times if you swim 10 meters apart you can't see each other because there's so many fish.

For instance, we get bigger storms. The island of Farquhar experienced the most vicious cyclone ever recorded in the Indian Ocean in 2016.", "\"And an increase of one degree in sea temperature will mean 80% of our coral will die.
