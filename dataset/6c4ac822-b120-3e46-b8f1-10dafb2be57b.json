Hence the calculated infamy that M-G-M, long ago, spun around Jean Harlow. One result was \u201cBombshell\u201d (1933), in which she plays a movie star whom nobody will leave alone\u2014not her agent, not her family, and not the moony suitor who tells her, \u201cI\u2019d like to run barefoot through your hair.\u201d", "I reckon that Harlow, who saw through men as if they were made of cellophane, would applaud the new \u201cBombshell,\u201d directed by Jay Roach, for its sterling trinity of heroines: Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie). None of them are as blindingly blond as Harlow, or as instantly outspoken, but all three summon the nerve to take a stand. The most Harlovian of the trio is Kelly, who begins by addressing us as she marches through the offices at Fox News. She is, of course, a real person, as is Carlson; when \u201cAmerica Live with Megyn Kelly\u201d concluded, in September, 2013, allowing Kelly to move to prime time, the afternoon slot was taken by \u201cThe Real Story with Gretchen Carlson.\u201d Ah, the real! You can\u2019t beat it.", "Actually, you can. If truth is golden, that means you can melt it, bend it, flake it, fake it, or pound it into dust. There is even a version for fools. Fox News is hardly the first organization to take advantage of such mutability, but it was there\u2014under the aegis of Roger Ailes, who was the chairman and C.E.O. from 1996 to 2016, and who died in 2017\u2014that the reshaping of the actual was raised to a fine and furious art. Reality, for Ailes, was something you knead.", "He is played in the film by John Lithgow, with the aid of what I sincerely hope is a pile of blubbery makeup. Either that or Lithgow lunched and dined on lasagna and banana splits for a year before filming commenced. He\u2019s such a cheerful and likable actor, and that makes it all the more startling to find him as the villain of the piece. Initially, indeed, he appears to do the decent thing. When Kelly moderates a Republican Presidential debate, in August, 2015, and then is insulted by Donald Trump for having challenged his misogyny, Ailes supports her. But is that because he genuinely backs her cause, or because he sniffs the scent of public battle, and with it a rise in the ratings?", "We know the answer, and the proof is provided by Kayla Pospisil, who describes herself as \u201can evangelical millennial,\u201d from a Midwestern family that regards Fox News as \u201cchurch.\u201d Freshly arrived at the inner sanctum, as a production assistant, she glows with aspiration, and wrangles a one-on-one with Ailes to plead her case. He tests her loyalty by asking her to stand before him and lift her skirt. \u201cHigher,\u201d he says, \u201cHigher.\u201d He hunkers down in his chair, steaming and snorting like a bull in a stall. This scene is the dark heart of the film; we are observing the effects of sexual abuse and emotional blackmail in real time, enacted with maximum intensity by Margot Robbie, and what\u2019s unforgettable are the tears of mortification that tremble in her eyes. Innocence can be lost in a matter of minutes.", "There\u2019s a problem, though. Kayla does not exist. She\u2019s a composite of various witnesses to Ailes\u2019s gross misconduct, and, although there\u2019s absolutely no doubting the credibility of what her character suffers, the mingling of fact and fiction sits a little uneasily in a movie that is dedicated to the righting of wrongs. As often occurs with topical tales, which are hellbent on catching a widespread mood (in this instance, anger and disgust), there\u2019s something hasty and undigested about \u201cBombshell.\u201d The screenplay is by Charles Randolph, who co-wrote \u201cThe Big Short\u201d (2015), with Adam McKay, and, as in that movie, the action is relentlessly sliced and diced. Why, we could almost be watching TV!", "Thus, we are suddenly offered video clips of Ailes\u2019s real-life victims, identified by their first names, testifying to his oppressive deeds. But how are we meant to square the brunt of this hard evidence, distressing as it is, with other people\u2019s sly and clearly scripted confessions to camera? When Carlson loses her show at Fox, for example, she informs her lawyers that she feels demoted to second base, before turning to us and adding, sotto voce, \u201cI hate second base.\u201d Whereas Theron, as Kelly, is a force of nature, not relinquishing command of the role for a second, Kidman seems oddly unsettled as Carlson, perhaps because the movie plants her at third base, behind the other two leads. I can\u2019t help recalling how secure, and how triumphantly mean, Kidman was in \u201cTo Die For\u201d (1995), in which she played a weather forecaster so ambitious that nothing, including murder, was permitted to get in her way. That film was as mischievous as \u201cBombshell\u201d is militant, and, on the surface, it had far less to impart. Which of the two, I wonder, will endure?", "History records that Kelly and Carlson, both of whom had once been put under sexual pressure by Ailes, left Fox News and went elsewhere. We are told, at the end of the film, that the victims\u2019 settlement packages were significantly less than what Ailes himself received from the company. Onscreen, he is given a gentle sendoff by Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell), who listens to his protestations and says, \u201cThere\u2019s no audience for that side of the story.\u201d Note the casting: Murdoch, the big unfriendly giant of modern media, is played by the guy who, back in 1971, had his eyelids clamped open in \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d the better to cram his brain with visions of outrage and dread. Fantastic."]}
