Unfortunately, the country doesn\u2019t have such a perspective today.\u201d", "The blame goes beyond the politicians.", "The majority of Harvard\u2019s business leaders pointed to lobbying, which comes out to be about $6 billion spent each election cycle, as one of the most pressing issues, as it primarily advances corporate interests at the expense of the public\u2019s.", "The report used the opioid crisis as an example. Advocates pushing for tighter controls on painkillers spent $4 million on lobbying, while drug companies spent $740 million in an effort to block federal and state regulation efforts.", "\u201cWe also need business leaders to change, fundamentally, how companies engage in politics,\u201d Porter said. \u201cMany companies today have been drawn into the party game and are making partisanship and gridlock worse.\u201d"], "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "title": "America has \u2018squandered\u2019 the recovery and is falling behind the rest of the world, according to Harvard study", "keywords": ["rest", "world", "according", "falling", "competitiveness", "porter", "political", "report", "system", "business", "spent", "america", "harvard", "recovery", "companies", "study", "used", "leaders", "squandered"], "summary": "\u201cOur major political parties have turned the political system into a duopoly that serves the parties rather than the public,\u201d Porter continued.\nBreaking it down by party line, 51% of Republicans expect America\u2019s competitiveness to improve, compared with only 24% of Democrats.\nThe report used the opioid crisis as an example.\nAdvocates pushing for tighter controls on painkillers spent $4 million on lobbying, while drug companies spent $740 million in an effort to block federal and state regulation efforts.\n\u201cWe also need business leaders to change, fundamentally, how companies engage in politics,\u201d Porter said."}
