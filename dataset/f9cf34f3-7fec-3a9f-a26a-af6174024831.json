And for leaders\u2014especially CEOs, who are watched like hawks by their employees, competitors, board of directors and the general public\u2014failing can threaten job security.", "Failure, however, is an inevitable part of the success equation, and a sign of striving valiantly. \u201cIf the only success you achieve is in areas where you have never struggled or failed, then that success is probably hollow, unmeaningful and not very significant,\u201d says Greg Fisher, associate professor of entrepreneurship at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business.", "How can embracing failure lead to success?", "", "Failure is part of the growth process, and according to Bill Wooditch, CEO of Wooditch Enterprises, and author of \u201cFail More: Embrace, Learn, and Adapt to Failure As a Way to Success,\u201d the greatest point of growth occurs right below your limit. By operating outside of your comfort zone, you can learn to embrace failure and actually study yourself failing.", "\u201cSuccessful people are motivated by failure and they don\u2019t view it as a signal to quit; it\u2019s their inspiration to work harder or try different methods,\u201d Wooditch says. \u201cThink of two musicians: a master bass player and an amateur.\u201d While the amateur might practice by playing pieces she\u2019s already familiar with, the master bass player will aim for new pieces and continue to fail right up to that point of growth.", "And in the 21st century, embracing failure has never been more important. \u201cIn a world where speed and uncertainty are high, it\u2019s essential for leaders to embrace failure as one half of success,\u201d says Terence Mauri, a Thinkers50 leadership expert and author of \u201cThe Leader\u2019s Mindset: How To Win In the Age of Disruption. \u201cIt\u2019s time to rethink failure; it should be regarded as the status quo, so if nine out of 10 things fail, it\u2019s essential to build a fail-fast-to-learn-fast culture.\u201d", "Mauri points to Booking.com as a company that embraces this type of culture, where learning from failure is a badge of honor instead of a badge of shame. \u201cAnybody at the company can launch an experiment and anybody can also kill an experiment that somebody else has launched,\u201d he explains.", "Amazon is another successful company that embraces failure. \u201cJeff Bezos wants to build a company of failure pioneers because failure and invention are inseparable twins, where the big bets pay for thousands of failed experiments.\u201d In fact, Mauri says the best way for leaders to scale success from failure is to imagine that the word \u201cfail\u201d stands for \u201cFrom Action I Learn.\u201d", "Success is a process, not a destination", "", "In embracing failure, it helps if you don\u2019t view success and failure as \u201cevents.\u201d For example, Wooditch says most successful people can\u2019t pinpoint the exact moment they became a success. \u201cThere are thousands of hours in training, unspoken sacrifices and, of course, \u2018blood, sweat and tears\u2019 behind their job title, coveted zip code and lifestyle,\u201d he says.", "If you\u2019re waiting for an event to dictate your success, Wooditch warns that you\u2019re likely to tap out when you encounter your first or second obstacle. \u201cBut the people who accept that success is a process view failure as a stepping stone, so they aren\u2019t intimidated by one misstep; they employ their resiliency and continue moving forward.\u201d", "One person who learned this lesson early on is Tom Golisano, founder of Paychex and author of \u201cBuilt Not Born: A Self-Made Billionaire\u2019s No-Nonsense Guide for Entrepreneurs.\u201d Golisano says he learned more about what to do by watching those who failed in business than he did by watching successful companies. \u201cNo business can avoid experiencing failures\u2014it\u2019s a cost of doing business.\u201d Golisano says, however, it\u2019s your reaction that may determine if you\u2019re a good leader or not. \u201cIn every situation, you have two options: roll over and take the hit, or study the failure and learn from it ... ask yourself, which action makes you stronger?\u201d", "And this holds true regardless of your industry. Fisher points to research by Carol Dweck at Stanford University. \u201cThe research shows that those individuals who approach tasks with a growth mindset\u2014where they are prepared to fail and learn from that failure\u2014are much more likely to be successful in the long term compared to those who operate with a fixed mindset where they see ability as inherently fixed and unchanging, and failure as fatal,\u201d he says.", "Framing failure", "", "On one hand, you shouldn\u2019t get bent out of shape when you experience failure; however, this doesn\u2019t mean that you should take an \u201coh well, I failed, what\u2019s next?\u201d approach. Wooditch recommends evaluating failure dispassionately. He recommends that you take a step back and ask yourself:", "What kept you from your goal?", "What steps can you take to avoid the pattern of failure?", "\u201cFrom there, each specific failure will provide you with an opportunity to improve by giving you clues on how not to fail.\u201d Over time, he says it will become easier to read clues and recognise patterns.", "Once the clouds have cleared, Wooditch says you can start to see the answers to these questions:", "How can you move forward?", "What new steps do you need to take?", "What old steps do you need to abandon?", "He recommends being specific and intentional about your goals and visualising yourself making them a reality.", "So, how much failure is acceptable? At what point should you think about giving up? Consider this quote by Michael Jordan (6 NBA Championships, 6 NBA Finals MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, 2 Olympic gold medals):", "\u201cI've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life.
