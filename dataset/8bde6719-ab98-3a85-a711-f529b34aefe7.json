What does that mean? It means that, according to Toylogic and Square Enix, the game is ready for prime time when it launches April 23.", "If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with the game, Nier Replicant is the Western release of the Japanese-exclusive version of 2010\u2019s Nier. The story of that game is similar to one players in the U.S. experienced; you\u2019re on a mission to cure a loved one from a deadly illness. But whereas the Western Nier starred a father trying to save his daughter, Replicant centers on a brother fighting to cure his sister. As such, the story takes a lot of different turns we didn't get to experience a decade ago. Meanwhile, the game\u2019s combat and presentation is not unlike 2017\u2019s Nier: Automata, which is the sequel to both versions of the original Nier.", "GI editors Kim Wallace and Jay Guisao recently sat down and discussed their impressions of Nier Replicant from the perspectives of a longtime fan and relative newcomer, respectively.
