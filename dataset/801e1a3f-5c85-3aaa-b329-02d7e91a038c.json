The FSB did not respond to a request for comment.", "Costin Raiu, the director of global research and analysis at Kaspersky, said there were three distinct similarities between the SolarWinds backdoor and a hacking tool called Kazuar, which is used by Turla.", "The similarities included the way both pieces of malware attempted to obscure their functions from security analysts, how the hackers identified their victims, and the formula used to calculate periods when the viruses lay dormant in an effort to avoid detection.", "\u201cOne such finding could be dismissed,\u201d Raiu said. \u201cTwo things definitely make me raise an eyebrow. Three is more than a coincidence.\u201d", "Confidently attributing cyber-attacks is extremely difficult and strewn with possible pitfalls.

Investigators have said it could take months to understand the extent of the compromise and even longer to evict the hackers from victim networks.", "US intelligence agencies have said the hackers were \u201clikely Russian in origin\u201d and targeted a small number of high-profile victims as part of an intelligence-gathering operation."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["hackers", "solarwinds", "compromise", "hacking", "used", "hack", "tools", "victims", "spying", "russian", "group", "researchers", "say", "turla", "linked"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
