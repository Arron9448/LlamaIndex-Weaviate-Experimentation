I\u2019d been looking for a flight back to New York since three o\u2019clock in the morning, after learning that the United States was closing its borders with Europe. The streets were nearly empty in the quiet medieval capital, a city once home to Paul Klee and Albert Einstein. Every other building seemed to be made of the same gray-green sandstone. Kiosk displays alternately flashed ads for the exhibition and public-health advisories, which had grown more alarming in the four days I\u2019d waited for Anatsui. Walking into the Kunstmuseum Bern, a stately neo-Renaissance structure overlooking the Aare, I realized that I would likely never meet the artist.", "Under a skylight in the second-story rotunda hung \u201cGravity and Grace\u201d (2010), a thirty-seven-foot sheet of more than ten thousand liquor-bottle tops joined with copper wire. Anatsui\u2019s works are often draped and folded, but this one was flat, and it shone like a dragon\u2019s hide stretched on an invisible rack. Shapes appeared in the field of aluminum disks, intricately arranged by chromatic value. A red sun enveloped in pink haze\u2014Gravity\u2014held court at one end; an oval of dusty blue\u2014Grace\u2014glimmered at the other. Around them, red, yellow, and silver caps swirled as though caught between orbits. The sculpture presided over the room like a faceless eminence, cautiously greeted by a semicircle of nineteenth-century busts.", "Anatsui, a seventy-six-year-old Ghanaian sculptor based in Nigeria, has transfigured many grand spaces with his cascading metal mosaics. Museums don them like regalia, as though to signal their graduation into an enlightened cosmopolitan modernity; they have graced, among other landmarks, the fa\u00e7ades of London\u2019s Royal Academy, Venice\u2019s Museo Fortuny, and Marrakech\u2019s El Badi Palace. The sheets sell for millions, attracting collectors as disparate as MoMA, the Vatican, and Bloomberg L.P. In the past ten years, public fascination with their medium\u2019s trash-to-treasure novelty has matured into a broader appreciation of Anatsui\u2019s significance. The man who dazzled with a formal trick may also be the exemplary sculptor of our precariously networked world.", "\u201cTriumphant Scale,\u201d a career-spanning survey, drew record-breaking crowds when it opened, in March, 2019, at Munich\u2019s Haus der Kunst. From there, the show travelled to the Arab Museum of Modern Art, in Doha, where Anatsui was f\u00eated by Qatari royalty. The exhibition had been slightly downsized for Bern, a city of mannered architecture and muted colors, where the artist\u2019s shimmering invertebrate creations seemed almost unreal by contrast. There were massive red and black monochrome works, whose uniformity drew attention to their subtle folds and textural variations. Others conjured up landscapes, like the sprawling floor sculpture that filled one small gallery with a garden of bottle-cap rosettes. I stood before the exquisitely varied \u201cIn the World but Don\u2019t Know the World\u201d (2009) for half an hour without exhausting its cartography: white-gold seas, blue-and-yellow checkerboards, silver cities with grids of black streets and tiny red districts.", "It was all aluminum, but up close I found an origami of distinct alterations. Many of the caps were crushed into the shape of fortune cookies; others were neatly folded into squares. A swath of see-through \u201clace\u201d was linked together from the bottles\u2019 thin seals. Some of the caps weren\u2019t caps at all. The brightest blues were tiles of roofing strip, while squares of iridescent silver had been cut from newsprint plates. I leaned in to read the tiny headlines and trademarks: \u201cLiquor Headmaster,\u201d \u201cPlans for safe drinking water,\u201d \u201cGame of luck explained.\u201d Every bit had been handled by countless individuals: Anatsui often describes his work as a gathering of \u201cspiritual charge.\u201d", "It was an incontestable demonstration that bottle caps have \u201cmore versatility than canvas and oil,\u201d as Anatsui recently wrote in the Guardian. A central principle of his work is the \u201cunfixed form,\u201d which leaves a sculpture\u2019s final configuration up to curators and collectors. \u201cHe thinks of these as living objects, just like human beings,\u201d Chika Okeke-Agulu, who curated \u201cTriumphant Scale\u201d with Okwui Enwezor, explained during our tour of the exhibition. He showed me one early metal sculpture made of rusty milk tins, which resembled a heap of oversized coins draped over a walrus. It was displayed as \u201cYam Mound,\u201d but the same work, differently arranged, had appeared under other names and guises. Nobody sees the same Anatsui twice.", "Okeke-Agulu, a scholar of modern and contemporary African art who teaches at Princeton, has known many Anatsuis. He studied with the artist as an undergraduate, later working as his studio assistant, and had carved two of the wooden wall reliefs on view. For Okeke-Agulu, the exhibition was a deeply personal milestone shadowed by the loss of his collaborator; Enwezor, perhaps the most influential curator of his generation, had died a year earlier. Confined by illness to his Munich apartment, where he kept a scale model of the museum\u2019s galleries, he oversaw the final preparations from his deathbed.", "\u201cThis is . . . a difficult . . . context . . . in which . . . to tell stories.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Tom Toro", "\u201cTriumphant Scale\u201d was in some ways the culmination of a campaign that began in 1994, when Okeke-Agulu published an interview with Anatsui in the inaugural issue of Nka, a journal that Enwezor founded to secure wider critical attention for African artists. Anatsui, who then worked in wood, had speculated about using cheap local materials to create large immersive sculptures. \u201cIt was precisely anticipating this moment,\u201d Okeke-Agulu told me. \u201cThe day that an African artist, alone, would occupy a major Western museum.\u201d", "When I reached El Anatsui in April, Nigeria, like most of the world, had locked down. The sculptor was at home, trying, he said, \u201cto keep the mind blank.\u201d He lives in a quiet hilltop neighborhood with sweeping views of Nsukka, the college town where he\u2019s resided for forty-five years. From his balcony, he could see his shuttered studio, where a monumental sheet destined for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, sat unfinished on the workroom floor. For Anatsui, who doesn\u2019t sketch in advance\u2014trees grow without a blueprint, he has remarked\u2014work had more or less ceased. He\u2019d cancelled trips to Bern, where I\u2019d originally planned to meet him, and to Ghana, for the opening of a new studio near Accra. But he took the interruptions philosophically. \u201cLife is a way of one being shuffled,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always wanted my work to be about life.\u201d", "Anatsui is an extraordinarily deliberate man, prone to thoughtful silences that I couldn\u2019t always distinguish from lags in our Skype connection. (\u201cEl doesn\u2019t chat, inside the studio or out,\u201d Amarachi Okafor, a former student of Anatsui\u2019s who now works as his assistant and archivist, warned me.) His voice is low and gentle, with long, melodious vowels that he uses to dwell and reflect. Often stopping to revise and refine his words\u2014or qualify them with a private laugh and a \u201cWell, not quiiite\u201d\u2014he gives the impression of being both incurably restless and infinitely patient. At public appearances, where he tends to dress in slacks and colorfully patterned shirts, he\u2019s a warm, unflappable presence: arms crossed, slight slouch, gaze steady between his close-cropped white hair and silver brow-line spectacles.", "The artist typically begins his mornings at six, waking to the sound of bells from a nearby Carmelite monastery. He drives to work in a Hyundai Tucson, stereo tuned to the Pidgin English station Wazobia, 93.7 FM. The studio, which opened in 2018, is a three-story fortress the color of gunmetal which towers over every other structure in the vicinity. Crews of young assistants shape bottle caps from distilleries in Nsukka and across Nigeria. (A supplier in nearby Onitsha, known for its storied market, ships more than a ton of them every few months.) The men work in two large halls of a gated complex equipped with offices, showers, security personnel, and enough room for several large works in various stages of assembly. But Anatsui says that his studio is, if anything, too small. A couple of years ago, he visited Anselm Kiefer\u2019s studio near Paris, where the German artist invited him to ride a bicycle across the hangar-size workshop. In comparison, he said, \u201cmy studio has no size at all.\u201d", "Everything starts on the ground. Anatsui paces the floor in sandals, bottle caps crunching underfoot, taking pictures and inspecting each block of linked metal before indicating where it should fuse into the larger composite. The bigger sheets are made of separable sections, and, often, Anatsui can\u2019t be sure of exactly what a composition will look like until it\u2019s installed. Sometimes he ascends a staircase to a small balcony for a better view. From there he directs assembly using a laser pointer, guiding his assistants like the conductor of a symphony orchestra.", "Anatsui recruited more than a hundred and fifty temporary workers to complete three monumental commissions for \u201cTriumphant Scale.\u201d In the words of his studio manager, Uche Onyishi, he \u201cextended his workshop into the community.\u201d Many were rural women who worked at home; others were students, teachers, or civil servants, some of whom earned more than their yearly salaries from the project. Nsukka\u2019s authorities took notice. Shortly after Anatsui returned from Munich, the town\u2019s traditional monarch awarded him an Igbo chieftaincy title\u2014a rare distinction, especially for a foreign-born man\u2014in recognition of his contributions to local life.", "Afamefuna Orji, a mechanical engineer who once worked at Anatsui\u2019s studio, first approached the artist for a job as an impoverished teen-ager. Anatsui not only hired him\u2014paying enough that his mother visited to make sure that the \u201cstudio\u201d wasn\u2019t a front for petty crime\u2014but supported his education. \u201cBoys come to the studio, and in a few months they have motorbikes, they have businesses set up,\u201d Okafor told me. \u201cSome of them graduate and still come back. It\u2019s art on another level.\u201d", "The virus interrupted this intensely collaborative work. Anatsui spent much of the spring and summer reading, growing produce in his garden, and walking for exercise around the empty university campus, where he taught sculpture in the fine-arts department for thirty-six years. His few indulgences revolve around wellness. A yoga and squash enthusiast, he attends yearly retreats at health resorts from Kerala to West Palm Beach, where he adopted a raw vegetarian diet. When I asked if he ever drinks the liquor that furnishes material for his sculptures, he said no, but added that, as a young man, he drank quite a bit. Now an occasional glass of beer or wine suffices, though a former colleague recently introduced him to single-malt whiskey.", "Anatsui, a lifelong bachelor, lives alone, but keeps in close touch with family in Ghana and the United States. It isn\u2019t always easy; Internet access comes and goes. He enjoys the comedy of Trevor Noah (\u201ca brilliant chap\u201d) and often exchanges memes with a nephew in Brooklyn, though he hardly uses social media, except to read the latest in a WhatsApp group dedicated to the highlife music of his Ghanaian youth. (His college band once performed alongside a formative group led by Fela Kuti, whose horn Anatsui played between sets; he says it was \u201cdecrepit.\u201d) Because the local utilities are so unreliable, he generates his own electricity using solar panels, and collects rainwater in a tank."], "authors": ["Julian Lucas", "Julian Luca"], "keywords": ["el", "broke", "studio", "work", "exhibition", "contemporary", "artist", "art", "scale", "seal", "anatsuis", "world", "anatsui", "works", "caps"], "pubDate": "2021-01-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
