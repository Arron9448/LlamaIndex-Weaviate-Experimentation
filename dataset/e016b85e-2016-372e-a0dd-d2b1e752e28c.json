This is a fitting sentiment for a city that has risen to glorious heights and fallen to defeat numerous times in its 5,000-year history.", "The \u201cdeath\u201d in question is Greece\u2019s 2009 financial crisis, which caused the economy to shrink by 27 per cent from a gross domestic product of \u20ac242bn in 2008 to \u20ac176bn in 2015, according to Elstat, the Greek statistics agency.", "The National Bank of Greece: at one point during the crisis Greece\u2019s debt was 180 per cent of GDP", "Residential property transactions across the country fell by more than 70 per cent over the same period, and the government implemented austerity measures to combat a debt pile of 180 per cent of GDP, shaking the capital with civil unrest.", "Now, a surge of foreign investors is breathing new life into Athens\u2019 housing market. Estate agent Knight Frank reported annual price growth of 11.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, elevating the capital to the top 10 of its Global Residential Cities Index in terms of growth.", "That said, house prices are still below their pre-crisis level.", "The city\u2019s historic charm and Mediterranean climate are obvious draws for international buyers. \u201cAthens combines the Greek flair \u2014 the style of the people, our hospitality, our vibrancy \u2014 with easy proximity to a very good natural environment outside the city,\u201d says Danae Tsakiris, an associate director with estate agent Savills in Athens.", "The uptick in sales has been accelerated by Greece\u2019s golden visa scheme. Implemented in 2013 to boost economic growth, the scheme grants residency permits to non-EU nationals, and their families, who purchase property of a value exceeding \u20ac250,000. Of 5,302 permits issued to investors to date, 3,464 have been claimed by Chinese buyers, followed by buyers from Turkey, Russia and Egypt.", "Most are flocking to central neighbourhoods such as Kolonaki and Plaka, where prices for prime apartments start at \u20ac4,000 per sq m and can rise to \u20ac8,000 for views of the Acropolis, the ancient citadel that towers above the city. In the prestigious Presidential Palace district, apartments can reach \u20ac12,000 per sq m but are still half the price of high-end neighbourhoods in Milan, Paris or London, Savvaidis notes.", "As more than half of foreign purchases have been geared towards buy-to-let, according to Savills, Athens has been subject to the Airbnb boom. \u201cAthens is sunny, very laid-back and does have a bit of an undiscovered \u2018edge\u2019 that young people are after,\u201d says Spyros Rennt, a photographer living between his native Athens and Berlin, of its growing appeal to creatives.", "\u201cBut with Airbnb running rampant, low-income families, immigrants and students are struggling to find places to rent and are constantly being displaced to suburbs further away.\u201d", "The coast of Attica is becoming a site that developers have their eye on", "The growth in investor appetite has led to limited stock in the city centre, reports Savills. However, Athens\u2019 historic heart is not the only area receiving attention: a flurry of coastline developments have been transforming the so-called Athens Riviera \u2014 about 16km from central Athens, stretching from the southern suburbs to the southernmost point of Attica \u2014 in an attempt to orientate urban life towards the sea.", "Piraeus Port is one of the largest commercial harbours in Europe, but the construction of a seafront highway in the 1960s created a barrier to the beach. The \u20ac8bn Hellinikon Project, due for completion within the next five years, aims to change that.", "A new business and residential district is emerging in the Piraeus Port area", "Built on the site of the former airport, the 620-hectare project spans 3.5km of coastline, constituting a \u201cnew municipality\u201d in terms of size, according to Tsakiris. It will feature a 200-hectare park \u2014 the largest coastal park in Europe \u2014 retail and business districts, and homes for 22,000 people.", "Hellinikon follows the completion of the Renzo Piano-designed Stavros Niarchos Cultural Center in Faliro Bay in 2016, including new facilities for the National Library of Greece and the Greek National Opera.", "In light of these developments, and proposals by Greece\u2019s new prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to cut corporation tax from 28 per cent to 24 per cent next year, Savvaidis is optimistic about continued growth in property prices.", "\u201cAll the macroeconomics are heading in the right direction,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are at the start of the recovery of our property market, without even considering the impact of the Greek banking system doing its job, which is lending to the people.\u201d", "Photographs: Dreamstime"], "keywords": ["foreign", "athens", "city", "greeces", "housing", "growth", "savvaidis", "market", "revival", "price", "cent", "savills", "greek", "buyers", "driven", "property"], "pubDate": null}
