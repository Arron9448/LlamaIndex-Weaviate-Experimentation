The Indian Wells Open, tennis\u2019s biggest prize outside the four majors and the scene of her first great triumph in 2018, was canceled. Miami followed suit, then the entire clay-court season, then the grass tournaments including Wimbledon, and most of the North American hard-court swing. \u201cI\u2019d never had a break like this before in my life,\u201d Osaka explains, \u201cso I just tried to clear my mind.\u201d She watched a lot of Netflix\u2014anime, mainly. In the morning she jogged. She cooked. She got restless and asked her agent for projects. She started drawing. She picked up the guitar but got frustrated when the chords didn\u2019t come together fast enough. She tuned into the news cycle in a way that the peripatetic professional tennis tour makes next to impossible. In May, George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, and for Osaka the event had a consuming force. In the months since, she has become tennis\u2019s most powerful advocate for racial justice.", "\u201cI\u2019m Black, and I live in America, and I personally didn\u2019t think it was too far-fetched when I started talking about things that were happening here\u201d", "\u201cI feel like this is something that was building up in me for a while,\u201d she says. Osaka was 14 and living in Boca Raton, Florida, when Trayvon Martin was fatally shot some three hours north. \u201cI watched the Trayvon stuff go down. For me that was super-scary. I travel so much during the year that I don\u2019t always know the news that\u2019s centered in the U.S. But then when the pandemic hit, there were no distractions. I was forced to look.\u201d Days after Floyd\u2019s death, Osaka and her boyfriend of two years, the rapper Cordae, flew to Minneapolis to join the protests. She had never been to a rally of any kind in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters if you\u2019re shy or not, or if you\u2019re introverted or extroverted. You\u2019re just there in the moment. When you see it in real life\u2014so many cameras filming everyone, police with guns outside the city hall, the parents of other victims telling their stories\u2014it kind of hits you differently. You\u2019re able to process it on your own terms.\u201d", "", "On social media, Osaka posted photos from the protest that were met with the inevitable hodgepodge of support and censure. She was told to stick to making statements with her tennis racket. Someone commented facetiously on her Instagram: \u201cYou\u2019ll loot everything right because that\u2019s the answer. And don\u2019t give me some speech on why looting is good or why everyone is rioting...Martin Luther King would be disappointed in you people.\u201d"], "authors": ["Rob Haskell", "Rob Haskel", "Annie Leibovit", "Jorden Bickha"], "keywords": ["thats", "tennis", "think", "champion", "naomi", "leading", "tenniss", "dont", "osaka", "trayvon", "started", "example", "youre", "peoples", "watched"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
