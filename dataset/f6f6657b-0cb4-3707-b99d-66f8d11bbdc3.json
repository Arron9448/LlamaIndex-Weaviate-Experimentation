On the campaign trail Boris Johnson threatened the licence fee, the charge on viewers from which it gets most of its funding. Labour is now accusing it of bias against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The BBC \u2019s defenders argue attacks from both sides mean it must be getting things about right. In normal times, tempers calm and the corporation sails on to its next generous licence-fee settlement.", "But things look dangerous for the BBC this time. The Tories\u2019 anger is deep. Their ire stems not only from their view of it as the Brexit Bashing Corporation (as Mr Johnson calls it) but their leader\u2019s treatment by Andrew Neil. Before the election, in a to-camera monologue that was widely shared, the BBC \u2019s most feared political interviewer goaded and chastised the prime minister for avoiding a grilling.", "That has put the corporation in the sights of Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s revolutionary strategy chief. His plans to shake up the civil service are well known. The BBC has apparently become another target. Its director-general, Lord Hall, has recently been hauled in to see him, according to people close to the broadcaster. Mr Johnson has reportedly banned cabinet ministers from appearing on the flagship \u201cToday\u201d radio programme. This week the government ordered a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee (currently set at an annual \u00a3154.50, or $203) should cease to be a criminal offence. Decriminalisation would cost the BBC \u00a3200m a year, it says. It would also signal that the government sympathises with those who have long attacked the licence fee as an unfair, anachronistic tax.", "Another unwelcome change from the Conservatives, decided in 2015 in order to achieve Treasury budget cuts, is about to hit. In a few weeks\u2019 time, well over 1m grannies and grandads will be hearing from Auntie. A letter will spell out that for the first time in nearly two decades, over-75s must cough up for the licence fee (people with incomes of less than \u00a3167.25 a week will be exempt).", "In deciding which over-75s get free licences and enforcing the system, the BBC is in effect being obliged to take on the job of the Department for Work and Pensions. \u201cThere will be confrontations with millions of people and that will deeply hurt the BBC \u2019s brand,\u201d says Claire Enders of Enders Analysis, a media-research firm. The government could decide to keep free licences for the over-75s and make the BBC pay for them. That would mean a big cut\u2014hundreds of millions\u2014to its licence-fee income of \u00a33.8bn, in addition to the cost of decriminalisation of non-payment.", "\u201cThe risk is that the walls close in on the BBC ,\u201d says Ed Williams, a former director of communications for the broadcaster who runs Edelman, a public-relations firm, in Europe. A mix of a big shift in politics, ageing audiences, the rise of video-streaming services like Netflix and the threat of public indifference is putting huge pressure on the corporation, he says. Persuading young people to watch and listen to the BBC has long been a problem. The average age of a BBC 1 viewer is now 61. The most recent annual review from Ofcom, the media regulator, found that for the first time, fewer than half (49%) of people aged 16 to 24 tuned in to BBC TV channels every week.", "As for the broader public, the BBC commands wide support. Three-quarters of adults told Ofcom that the corporation\u2019s public-service broadcasting purposes are important to society. Yet Netflix, the American entertainment behemoth, is now almost as trusted a brand in Britain as the BBC , research from Edelman shows. And a Brexit-dominated election has dented the BBC \u2019s standing. A YouGov poll this month showed that people trusted its journalists significantly less than they did in October."], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["agony", "danger", "spells", "auntie", "mr", "over75s", "britains", "fee", "fallout", "bbc", "election", "johnson", "s", "corporation", "licence", "week"], "id": "f6f6657b-0cb4-3707-b99d-66f8d11bbdc3", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/12/21/britains-election-fallout-spells-danger-for-the-bbc"}
