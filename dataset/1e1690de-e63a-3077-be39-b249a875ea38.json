The more powerful thread running through his speech was an argument that constitutional constraints were forms of weakness, that Vice President Mike Pence and Congress should not be allowed to certify the election, and that it was time to take the gloves off and fight.", "After Rudolph Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s have trial by combat,\u201d and Donald Trump Jr. said of Republican members of Congress who did not support Mr. Trump, \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you,\u201d the president took the stage. He praised his son and Mr. Giuliani, and then delivered a speech full of inflammatory implications. He stated: \u201cWe will never concede. We will not take it anymore.\u201d He condemned the Republican Party for fighting like \u201ca boxer with his hands behind his back,\u201d urged Mr. Pence in his capacity as presiding officer in Congress, to \u201ccome through for us,\u201d said it was up to Congress to refuse to certify the election, and then announced that he would lead the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol just after the speech. About the possibility that Mr. Pence and Congress would fail to block certification of the election on Wednesday, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to let that happen\u201d and then remarked on the size and devotion of the crowd.", "The president did speak of protecting the Constitution, but made that equivalent to supporting his own electoral victory. He announced that \u201cthe Republicans have to get tougher\u201d and then mockingly dismissed those members of Congress who worried \u201cthe Constitution doesn\u2019t allow me.\u201d He announced, \u201cWhen you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules\u201d and proclaimed, \u201cThis is a matter of national security.\u201d He went on, \u201cWe fight, we fight like hell, and if you don\u2019t fight like hell you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d He concluded by repeating the call to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to intimidate \u201cweak\u201d lawmakers into doing his bidding.", "The president and his surrogates may say that the language against weakness and for fighting was metaphorical. After all, he also said that the protest would be done \u201cpeacefully and patriotically.\u201d But when the violence first appeared on television, Mr. Trump did not immediately communicate any disapproval. When he did tweet a statement that afternoon, he confusingly urged his supporters to continue what they were doing (\u201cStay peaceful!,\u201d) and reiterated his support for them \u2014 this at the very moment they were engaged in the attack. The president reportedly failed to order the National Guard to defend Congress. His own former attorney general, Bill Barr, thought it was fair to describe the president\u2019s actions as \u201corchestrating a mob to pressure Congress.\u201d", "How will Congress respond? In the hours after the attack on the Capitol, members of Congress demonstrated their commitment to their institutional duties by returning to the building and finishing the work of accepting the results of the presidential election. Some of them gave fine speeches. The moment of danger had brought out a hint of heroism in them. But merely finishing the certification procedure is not enough. Nor will prosecuting individuals for their particular crimes address the fundamental constitutional issue, the blatant violation of the separation of powers."], "authors": ["Bryan Garsten"], "keywords": ["impeachment", "fight", "capitol", "york", "president", "congress", "speech", "members", "pence", "times", "defend", "mr", "election", "trump"], "pubDate": "2021-01-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
