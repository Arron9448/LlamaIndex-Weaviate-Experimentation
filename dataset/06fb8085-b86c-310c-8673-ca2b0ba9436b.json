But for my birthday this year, a friend sent the loveliest set of bath goodies, and I was finally moved to indulge. Now, I\u2019m hooked. My friends and castmates Ellen Pompeo and Caterina Scorsone both exhorted the benefits of magnesium bath salts, which I\u2019ve recently integrated into the routine. Bathing this way feels like pure heaven.", "Live edge chestnut bespoke bath caddy tray $64 ETSY Shop Now Lot XI Good Vibes hand-poured candle $60 LOT XI Shop Now", "Oraganix magnesium bath flakes $25 ORGANIX Shop Now", "3.

I\u2019m rediscovering yoga.", "Up until a few years ago, I had been a fairly ardent yogini with a consistent practice. Then, life got busier, my daily routines changed, and I fell off. Quarantine has given me time to ease my way back into my self-care habits. In many ways, rediscovering my yoga practice feels like becoming reacquainted with myself again.

I\u2019m listening to podcasts.", "Podcasts are my favorite thing to have on in the background while I\u2019m cooking, tidying up the house, or getting ready for the day. Besides devouring anything and everything true crime or cult-related, I cannot get enough of The Read, Pod Save the People, Lady Don\u2019t Take No, and Let\u2019s Shoot With Pete Chatmon. I also love any news podcasts with deep, thorough reporting that give me a well-rounded take on the news stories I can only grasp snippets of when scrolling through social media or my news apps (Radiolab, Serial).", "7. I\u2019m supporting important organizations.", "It has been deeply fulfilling to have more time to devote to the work of liberation and social justice. For me, that has meant finding ways to support organizations, causes, and campaigns that are in the trenches and doing the work to ensure that we live in a humane society in which every member can thrive. Equal Justice Society, The African American Policy Forum, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, A New Way of Life, and The Collective PAC are favorites."], "authors": ["Julie Tong"], "keywords": ["sane", "work", "kelly", "ways", "keeping", "way", "mccreary", "practice", "shop", "bath", "things", "yoga", "daily", "xi", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
