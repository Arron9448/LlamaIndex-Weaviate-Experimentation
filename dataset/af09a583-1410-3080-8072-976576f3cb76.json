A few astronomers, like Franz von Gruithuisen, an early-19th-century German, proposed asteroid impacts as the cause. But most rejected this theory based upon one simple, supremely confounding fact: The moon\u2019s craters are almost perfect circles. And, as anyone who has thrown a rock into dirt can tell you, that isn\u2019t what an impact scar should look like. Instead, the mark will be oblong, oval, and messy. (Gruithuisen probably didn\u2019t help his cause by also claiming to have seen cows grazing upon moon grass in these craters.) Further misleading any theorists, astronomers could make out little mountains in the center of each depression. Thus, for 300 years the majority of astronomers and physicists believed that (1) cows did not graze upon moon meadows, and (2) lunar volcanoes, rather than meteors, had pocked its face.", "Then, in the early 1900s, astronomers like Russia\u2019s Nikolai Morozov* began observing newly developed high explosives and made a rather startling discovery: Large explosions differ from thrown rocks in a number of ways, but most ominously\u2014at least for our species\u2019 continued existence\u2014they leave circular craters regardless of their angle of impact. As Morozov wrote in 1909 after conducting a series of experiments, asteroid impacts would \u201cdiscard the surrounding dust in all directions regardless of their translational motion in the same way as artillery grenades do when falling on the loose earth.\u201d", "*Morozov\u2019s biography reads a little like The Count of Monte Cristo if you replace revenge with science. He spent 25 years as a political prisoner in a 14th-century castle turned prison on a small island outside Saint Petersburg, during which time he taught himself 11 languages and published works on everything from the structure of the atom to the geology of the Western Caucuses. Shortly after his release, he turned his attention to astronomy.", "Before Morozov\u2019s discovery, astronomers were aware that asteroids could be devastating. \u201cThe fall of a bolide of even ten miles in diameter \u2026 would have been sufficient to destroy organic life of the earth,\u201d wrote Nathan Shaler, dean of Harvard\u2019s Lawrence Scientific School and proponent of the volcano theory, in 1903. But most believed this was an entirely theoretical exercise, partly because, as Shaler noted in his defense of the lunar volcanism theory, the very existence of humanity proved this sort of impact could not have occurred.", "Morozov\u2019s calculations changed that. Once you know the true origins of the scars on the moon, you don\u2019t have to be an astronomer\u2014or even own a telescope\u2014to arrive at the sobering conclusion that asteroids carry apocalyptic potential and that their impacts are inevitable.", "Shaler was, in a way, presciently incorrect. An asteroid of nearly the size he described did impact Earth and did wipe out the planet\u2019s dominant species. Only rather than wiping out humans it cleared the evolutionary path for a shrew-sized placental mammal to eventually crawl, walk, and consider a camping trip to the apocalypse.", "You might think the survival of your shrewlike ancestor proves that a larger-brained mammal like yourself would stand a reasonable chance. Unfortunately, the shrew had a number of apocalypse-friendly adaptations humans have since lost. The shrew could survive on insects, burrow away from the heat, and had fur to warm itself during the freezing decade that followed. You could replicate some of the shrew\u2019s survival strategies. You could burrow and expand your diet. But evolution has robbed you of others, and your opposable thumbs might not be enough to save you when that twinkling star enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere at 12.5 miles per second.", "At impacts of that speed, Earth\u2019s atmosphere behaves like water. Smaller rocks\u2014called meteors\u2014hit the atmosphere like pebbles into a pond; they decelerate rapidly at high altitudes, either burning away in their friction with the air or decelerating to their low-altitude terminal velocity of 164 mph. But the mountain-sized Chicxulub asteroid hits our atmosphere like a boulder into a puddle. It maintains its velocity until impact, plunging through the entire 60 miles of atmosphere in fewer than three seconds. The asteroid screeches over Central America, emitting a sonic boom that reverberates across the continents.", "It falls so quickly that the air itself cannot escape. Under intense compression, the air heats thousands of degrees almost instantly. Before the asteroid even arrives, compressed and superheated air vaporizes much of the shallow sea that covers the Yucat\u00e1n in the late Cretaceous. Milliseconds later, the rock plunges through what\u2019s left and slams into bedrock at more than 10 miles per second. In that instant, a few near-simultaneous processes occur.", "First, the impacting meteor applies so much pressure to the soil and rock that they neither shatter nor crumble, but instead flow like fluids. This radical effect actually makes it easier to visualize the formation of the crater, because the undulations of the earth almost exactly replicate the double-splash of a cannonballer in a backyard pool. The initial splash in all directions is followed by a delayed, vertical sploosh when the cavity created by the impactor rebounds to the surface."], "authors": ["Cody Cassidy", "Cody Cassid"], "keywords": ["impact", "air", "theory", "asteroid", "astronomers", "miles", "killer", "moon", "craters", "survive", "impacts", "atmosphere"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
