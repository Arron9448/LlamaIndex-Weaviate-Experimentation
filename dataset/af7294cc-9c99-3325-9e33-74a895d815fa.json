And if you love her, you don\u2019t need to hate me.\u201d", "I sat in stunned silence through most of the two-hour interview but this comment nearly made me yelp in recognition. Here was Meghan acknowledging, before an estimated 17 million viewers, a toxic dynamic that has raged online for years: the deeply divided \u201cteam Kate versus team Meghan\u201d camps that measure loyalty to one duchess in hatred of the other. I\u2019ve covered Meghan and the intersection of racist, sexist media narratives attacking her from their earliest days, but my Twitter mentions have nevertheless been rife with criticism from Meghan fans about how disingenuous I must be\u2026because I have also committed the cardinal sin of writing favorably about Kate in the past.", "\u201cThe polarization really is analogous to what we\u2019ve seen in politics.

But last year, after Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as senior royals, Kelley and What Meghan Wore editor Susan Courter decided to split the sites, in large part due to increasing tension and ugliness between Meghan and Kate fans. Monitoring hateful, sometimes racist comments on Facebook and Instagram became a draining daily practice for the Susans, who remain close: \u201cThere were a couple of times we were on the phone with each other in tears because we were so exhausted,\u201d Kelley said. Once, Kelley accidentally tweeted a Kate story from the Meghan account: \u201ca simple human error, but people treated it as the most cataclysmic, diabolical thing that could have happened.\u201d At What Meghan Wore, Courter began to feel she couldn\u2019t, for example, wish Kate a happy birthday \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to get destroyed and I\u2019m going to lose followers.\u201d"], "authors": ["Michelle Ruiz", "Michelle Rui"], "keywords": ["does", "markle", "middleton", "team", "susan", "kelley", "vs", "im", "meghan", "seen", "racist", "sites", "kate", "wore"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
