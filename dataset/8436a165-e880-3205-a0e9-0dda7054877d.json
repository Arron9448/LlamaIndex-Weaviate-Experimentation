Pompeo, a little-known congressman from Wichita, helped persuade Marco Rubio to make a late stand in Kansas. Like many Republicans in Congress, Pompeo believed that Rubio had the national-security knowledge and the judgment to be President, and Trump did not. Urged on by Pompeo, Rubio\u2019s team pulled money out of other states to gamble on winning the Kansas caucus. It was one of the few remaining contests in which Rubio still hoped to beat Trump, who, he said, was a \u201ccon artist\u201d about to \u201ctake over the Republican Party.\u201d On March 5th, Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, arrived in Wichita for the caucus. Rubio left his closing argument to Pompeo, who told the crowd at the Century II arena, \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to you from the heart about what I believe is the best path forward for America.\u201d An Army veteran who finished first in his class at West Point, Pompeo cited Trump\u2019s boast that if he ordered a soldier to commit a war crime the soldier would \u201cgo do it.\u201d As the audience booed, Pompeo warned that Trump\u2014like Barack Obama\u2014would be \u201can authoritarian President who ignored our Constitution.\u201d American soldiers \u201cdon\u2019t swear an allegiance to President Trump or any other President,\u201d Pompeo declared. \u201cThey take an oath to defend our Constitution, as Kansans, as conservatives, as Republicans, as Americans. Marco Rubio will never demean our soldiers by saying that he will order them to do things that are inconsistent with our Constitution.\u201d Listening backstage, Trump demanded to know the identity of the congressman trashing him. A few minutes later, Pompeo concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn down the lights on the circus.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s stinging rebuke of Trump got barely a mention in the local press, and Rubio finished third in Kansas. \u201cWe got smoked,\u201d a former top Rubio campaign aide told me. Days later, Rubio\u2019s campaign was over. In May, Trump secured the delegates needed for the nomination, and Pompeo reluctantly joined the rest of Kansas\u2019s congressional delegation in endorsing him. Still, Pompeo had told the Topeka Capital-Journal, in April, that Trump was \u201cnot a conservative believer,\u201d and, a few weeks later, he said, on CNN, \u201cA lot of his policies don\u2019t comport with my vision for how I represent Kansas.\u201d At that point, Pompeo had never met Trump. Like many Republicans who called Trump a \u201ckook,\u201d a \u201ccancer,\u201d and a threat to democracy before ultimately supporting him, Pompeo disagreed with much of Trump\u2019s platform. He took issue in particular with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d skepticism about the United States\u2019 role in the world. Pompeo was a conservative internationalist who had been shaped by his Cold War-era military service, and he remained a believer in American power as the guarantor of global stability. Yet, after Trump won the Presidency, Pompeo sought a post in his Administration and did not hesitate to serve as his C.I.A. director. In 2018, after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by tweet, Pompeo happily replaced him as America\u2019s top diplomat. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who keeps an open Bible on his desk, now says it\u2019s possible that God raised up Trump as a modern Queen Esther, the Biblical figure who convinced the King of Persia to spare the Jewish people. He defines his own job as serving the President, whatever the President asks of him. \u201cA Secretary of State has to know what the President wants,\u201d he said, at a recent appearance in Washington. \u201cTo the extent you get out of synch with that leader, then you\u2019re just out shooting the breeze.\u201d No matter what Trump has said or done, Pompeo has stood by him. As a former senior White House official told me, \u201cThere will never be any daylight publicly between him and Trump.\u201d The former official said that, in private, too, Pompeo is \u201camong the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump.\u201d Even more bluntly, a former American ambassador told me, \u201cHe\u2019s like a heat-seeking missile for Trump\u2019s ass.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s transformation reflects the larger story of how the Republican Party went from disdaining Trump to embracing him with barely a murmur of dissent. This account of how Pompeo became the last survivor of the President\u2019s original national-security team and his most influential adviser on international affairs is based on dozens of interviews in recent months with current and former Administration officials, U.S. and foreign diplomats, and friends and colleagues of Pompeo\u2019s; the Secretary did not answer repeated requests for comment. Thirty-one months into the Administration, the relationship between Trump and Pompeo, born in derision and remade in flattery, has proved to be surprisingly durable. Trump often gushes about Pompeo, even as he has berated his hawkish national-security adviser, John Bolton, for taking similar positions. \u201cI argue with everyone,\u201d Trump told a reporter. \u201cExcept Pompeo.\u201d", "Fifty-five, burly, and barrel-chested, Pompeo lives with his second wife, Susan, and their golden retriever, Sherman, in a rented house on the grounds of a military base across the street from the State Department. A film buff and an AC/DC fan, he seems modest and approachable in settings where he\u2019s comfortable. When challenged, especially about the President, he gets testy and red in the face. He favors baggy gray suits and close-cropped gray hair. Trump, who often talks about whether someone \u201clooks the part,\u201d has made a point of calling out Pompeo\u2019s unglamorous presence. At a recent appearance in South Korea, he summoned Pompeo to the stage with his daughter Ivanka, referring to them as \u201cbeauty and the beast.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s background bears little resemblance to that of recent Secretaries of State, all of whom came to the job after long careers in public life and with extensive international experience. Pompeo, in contrast, has had a \u201cmeteoric rise,\u201d as his friend Steve Scalise, the House Republican Whip, told me. A little more than a decade ago, he was unknown not only in Washington but also in his adopted home state, where he had just lost his first campaign, placing third in a three-way race to become chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. Trump often touts Pompeo\u2019s credentials as a top student at West Point and at Harvard Law School, but in six years as a member of Congress he never chaired a subcommittee or faced a genuinely competitive election, and he served just over a year at the C.I.A. He spent much of his career running a struggling Wichita aviation company. Pompeo\u2019s disclosure forms reveal that he is the poorest member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, listing family assets worth roughly, in 2018, between two hundred thousand and seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Watch \u201cThe Backstory\u201d: Susan B. Glasser reports on how Mike Pompeo reinvented himself and went from an obscure congressman to Trump's most influential adviser on international affairs. Born in 1963, Pompeo was one of three children in a working-class family in Southern California. His father, Wayne, was a Navy radioman in the Korean War. His mother, Dorothy Mercer, was one of ten children of small-town Kansas pool-hall owners. In conservative Orange County, Wayne was a passionate liberal, according to two sources who heard this from the future Secretary. Pompeo does not speak publicly about his political disagreements with his father, but they began early on: he has said that, as a teen-ager, he read Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d and became a staunch conservative. The valedictorian of his public high school, he was nominated for West Point by his congressman, Bob Dornan, a fiery hard-right favorite of the defense industry. \u201cThat should give you a good idea of where I am coming from politically if \u2018B-1 Bob\u2019 chose me for West Point,\u201d Pompeo told the conservative magazine Human Events, in 2011. Pompeo thrived at West Point, where he majored in engineering management. \u201cMan, it\u2019s hard to be No. 1,\u201d a classmate told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not just being the smartest person. It\u2019s being the person who shines your shoes the best and also has the most athletic skills.\u201d After marrying his college sweetheart, Leslie Libert, the weekend he graduated, Pompeo took a prestigious posting as a tank commander in the U.S. Army\u2019s 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which patrolled the border between East and West in Germany. Five years later, with the end of the Cold War, the border was gone and Pompeo left the military, having risen to the rank of captain. He went to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Law Review, then moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the blue-chip firm Williams & Connolly. In the late nineties, however, Pompeo radically changed his life. He quit the law firm after two years and divorced his wife. (He kept the dog, Byron; she got the cat, Keats.) He moved to Kansas, his late mother\u2019s home state, where, in early 1997, he and \u201cthree of my best friends in the whole world\u201d from West Point, as he put it recently, started a company, Thayer Aerospace. Their aim was to acquire firms that manufactured specialized machinery for aviation companies clustered in Wichita, a city known as \u201cthe air capital of the world.\u201d Pompeo became Thayer\u2019s C.E.O. While buying one of the companies for the new firm, he met Susan Justice Mostrous, a former Wichita State University homecoming queen. As the vice-president of a local bank, she was sitting on the other side of the negotiating table. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Pompeo told an interviewer, jokingly. \u201cShe took my money twice.\u201d In 2000, he and Susan married and he adopted her son from her second marriage. Pompeo became a deacon of Wichita\u2019s Eastminster Church, an evangelical congregation that eventually quit the mainstream Presbyterian Church because of its support for gay clergy. Over time, Pompeo got to know some of the city\u2019s wealthiest benefactors, including David Murfin, one of the largest independent oil producers in Kansas, and Charles and David Koch, the billionaire Republican donors and skeptics of environmental regulation, whose company is headquartered in Wichita. In 1998, the Kochs\u2019 venture-capital fund made a key early investment in Thayer. Within a few years, Pompeo was a trustee of the Flint Hills Center for Public Policy, which also has ties to the Kochs, and he was an early recruit for the Kochs\u2019 national political organization, Americans for Prosperity. In 2010, amid the Tea Party backlash to President Obama, Pompeo made another career switch, running for an open Congress seat in the state\u2019s Fourth District. The establishment climber from California had become a heartland evangelical. Pompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle, who, unlike Pompeo, had grown up in Wichita. Pompeo\u2019s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a \u201cturban topper,\u201d and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to \u201cVote American\u2014Vote Pompeo.\u201d In the heavily Republican district in a heavily Republican year, he won easily. \u201cPompeo\u2019s singular ability is in navigating power,\u201d Goyle told me. \u201cOn that I give him massive respect, the way he mapped Wichita power, the way he mapped D.C. power, the way he mapped Trump.\u201d", "The narrative of Pompeo\u2019s transformation has been rewritten over the years, or never told at all. Most notably, the Kochs were far more significant backers of his business than he has publicly acknowledged. In 2011, the Washington Post reported that, according to Pompeo and his aides, the investment by the Kochs\u2019 venture-capital fund \u201camounted to less than 2 percent\u201d of Thayer\u2019s total. Their statement was highly misleading. Corporate documents for 2003 filed with the Kansas secretary of state but not previously reported show that the Kochs\u2019 fund had a nearly twenty-per-cent interest in Thayer. The Kochs were also involved in the firm\u2019s management. Both the president and the chief financial officer of the Kochs\u2019 venture fund sat, at various times, on Thayer\u2019s board of directors, and in 2000 the fund helped secure loans of up to four million dollars for the firm to buy property. The Kochs\u2019 extensive involvement was not a secret: their fund announced on its Web site that it was part of Thayer\u2019s \u201cequity sponsor group,\u201d adding that it had given Pompeo\u2019s firm wide-ranging support, including \u201cacquisition capital, strategic input at the board level, and guidance in environmental risk issues.\u201d The environmental risk turned out to be significant. Air Capitol Plating, an aircraft-parts processing company that Thayer took over in 1999, had for years been the subject of environmental complaints because of its use of the toxic chemical trichloroethylene, or TCE, dangerous traces of which had leaked into the local groundwater. In 2000, Thayer entered into a legal consent order with Kansas authorities, in which it admitted to the pollution and agreed to clean it up. To address the problem, Thayer had brought in another Koch-backed firm, Cherokee, which specialized in \u201crisk management services\u201d for firms \u201cthat face environmental challenges.\u201d A new entity, Cherokee Thayer, assumed liability for the cleanup, although it appears that little if any cleanup was carried out. Instead, the company and the authorities spent years arguing over the extent of the contamination and what to do about it. Meanwhile, the firm continued to pollute, failed to file required reports in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and was fined more than a hundred thousand dollars by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2005, the state found high levels of TCE in nearby residential wells, resulting in a \u201cthreat to human health,\u201d and the E.P.A. named it a High Priority Violator. According to the State of Kansas, this month, twenty years after Thayer purchased A.C.P., a permeable barrier will finally be installed to insure that no additional TCE flows from the site into the water supply. In speeches, Pompeo often describes Thayer as a \u201csmall\u201d company and himself as a \u201csmall businessman.\u201d He has reminisced about Thayer as \u201ca small, dirty, smelly, beautiful machine shop.\u201d In fact, by 2000, according to a press release that year, the Kochs and other wealthy backers had invested ninety million dollars in the firm. Despite that funding, Thayer struggled financially when Pompeo ran it\u2014another aspect of his past that Pompeo has publicly sought to revise. During his first run for Congress, in 2010, one of his Republican-primary rivals, a local millionaire named Wink Hartman, claimed that Pompeo was \u201cforced out\u201d of Thayer after having mismanaged the company into financial trouble, the Wichita Eagle reported. Pompeo denied the accusation, saying that he left Thayer on \u201cexcellent terms,\u201d while acknowledging some difficulties, which he blamed on a downturn in the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks. But the company\u2019s problems began before 9/11 and continued well beyond. In 1999, the Thayer subsidiary Air Capitol Plating started going downhill. According to testimony from Randy Birchfield, a West Point classmate whom Pompeo recruited to run A.C.P., business had slowed and there were layoffs, cutbacks in bonuses and health-care benefits, and rumors of imminent bankruptcy. \u201cClearly, the trend lines were moving in a direction that wasn\u2019t comforting for anyone,\u201d Birchfield said, in a deposition in a lawsuit between Thayer and A.C.P.\u2019s former owners. The firm\u2019s difficulties persisted. Thayer\u2019s former human-resources manager, Kenneth Bollinger, said that he \u201cdirected the systematic layoff of nearly half the employees after 9/11.\u201d A company balance sheet showed that, as of May, 2004, Thayer had just thirty-one thousand dollars in cash on hand and a negative \u201cnet worth\u201d of almost thirty-three million dollars. In 2005 and 2006, venders sued Thayer for more than three hundred thousand dollars in unpaid bills. In both years, Thayer authorized new shares to be issued, which would raise needed capital but could also dilute the stakes of early shareholders such as the Kochs\u2019 fund. By April of 2006, Pompeo was no longer leading the company. The firm\u2019s post-Pompeo president lists on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 today the \u201csuccessful turnaround\u201d of Thayer, which was renamed Nex-Tech Aerospace and sold to the private-equity firm Highland Capital, in April, 2007, with the assistance of a company that advertised expertise in the \u201cwind-down\u201d of \u201coverleveraged and underperforming companies.\u201d The same month as the sale, the Wichita Business Journal reported that the new C.E.O. described his job as being to \u201crebuild a reputation damaged by an era of missed deliveries and slow supplier payments.\u201d Pompeo personally held a ten-per-cent interest in the firm as of 2003, but his financial-disclosure forms and his modest net worth suggest that he did not make much money from selling it. Pompeo, however, soon landed with one of his Wichita contacts, David Murfin, the Kansas oil tycoon. Murfin named Pompeo president of Sentry International, an oil-services firm that manufactured parts in China and elsewhere and sold them in the U.S. One Sentry joint venture was with a subsidiary of the Chinese national oil firm Sinopec, although Pompeo later told the Senate that he had no business ties to foreign government-owned entities. Like the Kochs, Murfin was a major player in Kansas Republican politics. Kelly Arnold, at that time the Sedgwick County G.O.P. chairman, told me that Murfin was \u201ca key person for anybody running for office.\u201d In January, 2007, Pompeo ran for the chairmanship of the Kansas Republican Party, against Tim Huelskamp, a future congressman, and Kris Kobach, a firebrand who represented the Party\u2019s anti-immigrant right wing. \u201cPompeo\u2019s pitch to the Party was: I\u2019m going to run this thing like a business,\u201d Dan Rasure, who helped Pompeo in that race, told me. \u201cTo the rest of the world this may sound crazy, given how much Pompeo has catered to the ultra-conservatives once he became elected, but, in Kansas terms, Pompeo is just straight-up what would be considered a moderate.\u201d Coming into the state G.O.P. convention, Pompeo believed that he \u201chad the race sewn up,\u201d Rasure said, but Kobach flipped a bloc of votes, and won. Rasure stayed in touch with Pompeo, and persuaded him to become the first investor in his new alternative-energy startup, Sunflower Wind, which planned to make wind turbines. Pompeo, who personally invested as much as a hundred thousand dollars, served on the board and was a key adviser to the young C.E.O., who considered his advice invaluable. \u201cI would never bet against Pompeo,\u201d Rasure told me. But the firm went bust after one of its turbine blades cracked, and everyone involved lost money. Pompeo had better luck in politics. By 2010, Wichita\u2019s U.S. representative, Todd Tiahrt, had decided to run for the Senate. In the crowded Republican primary to succeed him, Pompeo was again backed by the city\u2019s business \u00e9lite. Murfin became his campaign co-chairman. Pompeo won the primary with thirty-nine per cent of the vote. \u201cLet\u2019s make a pact\u2014if neither of us is married by thirty, we read an article about how many people are getting married later these days anyway.\u201d Cartoon by Will McPhail Soon after arriving on Capitol Hill, in 2011, he was the subject of articles in both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, in which he was portrayed, as one Kansas professor told the Post, as the new \u201ccongressman from Koch.\u201d That Post article is where Pompeo and his aides misrepresented the Kochs\u2019 investment in Thayer as an almost negligible two per cent. Pompeo would never again be directly challenged about Thayer. When he ran for re\u00eblection in 2014, he aired a campaign ad touting his \u201cremarkable success\u201d leading the company. His positions evolved along with the story of his past. When Pompeo got to Congress, he argued that wind power was an expensive boondoggle and campaigned to end a production tax credit for wind technology, even though, not long before, he had personally invested in Sunflower Wind. By the time Pompeo joined the Trump Administration, he had written Sunflower out of his history, omitting from his Senate confirmation questionnaire his position as a member of its board.", "In Washington, Pompeo found a way onto the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the critical panel for the business interests of his Kansas patrons. He appointed a former Koch lawyer as his chief of staff and acquired a reputation as a fierce defender of the Kochs. \u201cStop Harassing the Koch Brothers\u201d was the title of an op-ed that he wrote in 2012, in which he dismissed attacks on them as \u201cevidence of a truly Nixonian approach to politics.\u201d Two years later, he called the Kochs \u201cgreat men.\u201d His loyalty was rewarded: according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 he received more campaign funds from the Kochs\u2019 network than any other candidate in the country. But Pompeo hoped to make his mark in Congress on national security, and the Intelligence Committee was the panel that he most wanted to serve on. He got there in part by aiding the committee\u2019s chairman, Mike Rogers, who sought Pompeo\u2019s help in quelling an incipient rebellion by his fellow Tea Party members over the renewal of the wide-ranging surveillance authorized in the U.S.A. Patriot Act after 9/11. On the committee, Pompeo was regarded by his colleagues as smart and hardworking, \u201cvery bright, very politically shrewd,\u201d as Adam Schiff, a Democrat, put it, \u201cwith a certain pugnacious quality to his persona.\u201d Pompeo gained attention as one of the most partisan promoters of conspiracy theories about the killing of the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans at a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. For years, Pompeo criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of the incident, and, when the select committee that was created to investigate it issued a bipartisan report clearing her, Pompeo and Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, were the only dissenters, arguing that Clinton knew Benghazi was a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d but, with the 2012 Presidential election only two months away, she covered it up. Pompeo confronted Clinton when she testified before the panel on October 22, 2015. He badgered her about why she had given her private e-mail address to her outside political adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, but not to the Ambassador to Libya. Their encounter was widely seen as a disaster for Pompeo, and he later told a local Republican club in Kansas that even his wife, Susan, had given him an F for his performance. \u201cHe was a Benghazi crazy,\u201d a former senior intelligence official who dealt with Pompeo told me. Although his allegations were discredited, the investigation revealed that Clinton had deleted thirty thousand e-mails from a private server that she used while she was Secretary of State. Given that a subsequent F.B.I. investigation into Clinton\u2019s e-mails hung over her 2016 campaign, the former official said of Pompeo, \u201cat the end of the day, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.\u201d Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran was another obsession. Pompeo befriended the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a younger fellow Harvard graduate and Army veteran, and they argued that not only would the deal fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; it was also an appeasement of the world\u2019s worst sponsor of terrorism. In 2015, they travelled together to Vienna and then revealed what they said were \u201csecret side deals\u201d that the Obama team had agreed to with the Iranians. Pompeo\u2019s pronouncements on Benghazi and on the Iran deal led to new media prominence on Fox News and other right-wing outlets, where he became one of the fiercest critics of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. He trafficked in outlandish theories and engaged in slashing personal attacks. On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Pompeo called Clinton\u2019s role in Benghazi \u201cworse, in some ways, than Watergate.\u201d But Pompeo grew restless in the House. In 2014, according to a Kansas Republican he consulted, Pompeo briefly considered challenging Kansas\u2019s senior senator, Pat Roberts, in that year\u2019s primary. In the spring of 2016, he publicly flirted with a challenge to the state\u2019s other Republican senator, before dropping that, too.", "By the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pompeo had, at least in public, changed his mind about Trump. \u201cI am excited for a commander in chief who fearlessly puts America out in front,\u201d he told the Wichita Eagle while in Cleveland as Trump accepted the nomination. He expressed even more excitement about Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, whom Pompeo considered a \u201cfriend and mentor\u201d from their time together in Congress. Pence, too, had strong ties to the Kochs, and Pompeo found a connection to Pence\u2019s campaign in Marc Short, a veteran operative for the Kochs\u2019 organization. Although the Kochs had opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, Short signed on as an adviser to Pence and is now his chief of staff. \u201cMarc knows Mike well,\u201d a Republican friend of Pompeo\u2019s told me, and Short got Pompeo to help Pence with debate preparation that fall. When Trump won, Pence repaid the favor by recommending Pompeo. The weekend after the election, Pompeo called a Kansas Republican who had worked for Trump and told him that he hoped to become either C.I.A. director or Secretary of the Army. The two decided that he should work his ties to Pence and to a West Point classmate, David Urban, who had run Trump\u2019s campaign in Pennsylvania. Urban was also hearing from Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s ultranationalist chief strategist, who called Urban to suggest that he urge \u201cthe old man\u201d to name Pompeo to the C.I.A. post. Urban did so. On Wednesday, November 16th, Pompeo was summoned to Trump Tower for an interview with the President-elect. The men had never met, and still disagreed about key issues, such as Russia. Trump wanted to lift sanctions on Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and disdained the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s finding that Russia had intervened on his behalf in the election. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about Putin,\u201d Trump told Pompeo, according to an account that Pompeo later offered to Republican insiders. \u201cNo,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Two days later, Trump announced that Pompeo was his nominee for the C.I.A. job. Trump seemed to know little about him, and Representative Devin Nunes, a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, later said that he didn\u2019t think Pompeo had even filled out a vetting questionnaire. After the announcement, Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz\u2019s former campaign manager, called Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and reminded him of Trump\u2019s fury at Pompeo\u2019s Kansas caucus speech. As Tim Alberta recounts in his book, \u201cAmerican Carnage,\u201d Kushner put the call on speaker, so that Trump could hear. \u201cNo! That was him? We\u2019ve got to take it back,\u201d the President-elect roared. \u201cThis is what I get for letting Pence pick everyone.\u201d But the appointment stood. Two weeks later, Pompeo was hanging out with Trump in Urban\u2019s box at the Army-Navy football game. Pompeo reminded other Republicans that he and Trump had a common enemy: Barack Obama. \u201cHe just made his political peace with reality\u2014this is our President,\u201d a former official in the George W. Bush Administration told me. Just months earlier, Pompeo had compared the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d Obama to Trump, but Pompeo now saw joining Trump\u2019s Cabinet as \u201can opportunity to kind of right the wrongs,\u201d the former Bush official said. On January 23rd, Pompeo was confirmed, in a 66\u201332 vote. By then, he had deleted his entire congressional Twitter account, including a plea to the President-elect, days before Trump named him C.I.A. director, to \u201cmake the undemocratic practice of executive orders a thing of the past.\u201d Trump, of course, did no such thing.", "When Pompeo arrived at the C.I.A., he faced a political furor generated by the new President. Days before his swearing-in, Trump had compared the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany for its handling of a secret dossier on Trump\u2019s Russia ties. Then, at a welcoming ceremony in the lobby of C.I.A. headquarters, the President had attacked the agency again and made false claims about the size of the crowd at his Inauguration. Still, Pompeo managed to soothe the C.I.A. bureaucracy. He promised members of the Directorate of Operations that they would no longer be micromanaged, as they were under Obama. He vowed \u201cto serve as an important bridge, if not a heat shield, not just from the White House but from any sort of political attacks,\u201d Juan Zarate, a former U.S. official whom Pompeo asked to lead his transition to the C.I.A., told me. Pompeo also personally delivered the President\u2019s Daily Brief to Trump, giving the C.I.A. valuable access to a skeptical President. \u201cMike got them in the room every day, and that is the most important thing the agency expects to have with its director,\u201d the former senior intelligence official said. Pompeo used the sessions to establish a friendly relationship with the President, a contrast to Trump\u2019s friction-filled dealings with other top national-security advisers. \u201cHe clicked with Mike early on, and Mike has had the benefit of that. Mike gets the President,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump\u2019s, told me. Steve Scalise said that he remembers White House meetings in which \u201cthe President would look to Mike Pompeo before he even looked to Tillerson to get his assessment on different hot spots. That told me the President had incredible trust for Mike\u2019s judgment, and it\u2019s well founded.\u201d Pompeo and his wife, who played an active role both in his office on the Hill and at the C.I.A., cultivated relationships not only with Trump but inside Trumpworld. One of these was with the Cabinet\u2019s glitziest couple, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton. They made a seemingly odd foursome\u2014the poorest member of Trump\u2019s inner circle and one of its richest, an evangelical Kansan and an actress who got in trouble for vamping in opera-length black leather gloves at the U.S. Mint. Yet Linton recently told Los Angeles magazine that her favorite thing in Washington was dinner with the Pompeos. When the interviewer seemed incredulous, she replied, \u201cBut Pompeo is fun! He\u2019s warm; he\u2019s gregarious; he\u2019s a great storyteller. He\u2019s a lovely man. I love his wife, Susan.\u201d Pompeo seemed to relish the C.I.A. job. He told a friend that, while flying around the world to meetings on a U.S. government plane, he would read the agency\u2019s secret histories of wars in places like Afghanistan and Central America. Still, the former senior intelligence official said, \u201che wasn\u2019t satisfied with being C.I.A. director. He wanted to be national-security adviser or Secretary of State.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to get the man who has everything. So we burned down your house first.\u201d Cartoon by Liana Finck By the fall of 2017, Rex Tillerson was in trouble with the President. That summer, he had called Trump a \u201cfucking moron,\u201d and he often disagreed with Trump on policy decisions, such as withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. When Trump demanded an immediate withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Tillerson pushed for more time. Most other advisers agreed with Tillerson, but Pompeo, a former senior official told me, twice sat in the White House Situation Room and supported leaving the Iran deal, sidelining his agency\u2019s concerns about doing so. The Iran deal was one subject on which Trump and Pompeo were closely aligned before 2016. Another former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo gave \u201cstrong brushback\u201d to experts on the Iran desk at the C.I.A. after they concluded that Iran was complying with the terms of the deal\u2014a sore point, since Trump was claiming that Iran was not doing so. The first former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo challenged the agency\u2019s Iran analysts: \u201cHe would ask, \u2018What evidence? Are the Iranians cheating?\u2019 \u201d At the White House, Pompeo waged what the former senior official saw as a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to replace Tillerson. The escalating internal fight over Iran played into it. \u201cPompeo was working it hard. He saw and heard from the President how much he was souring on Tillerson,\u201d the former official told me. \u201cHe was making the case to Trump: You\u2019ve got a whole lot of people around you who don\u2019t agree with you. I\u2019m your guy.\u201d An important proponent of Pompeo was Jared Kushner, who repeatedly clashed with Tillerson after Trump assigned his son-in-law an expansive portfolio that included everything from China to Mexico to Mideast peace. At a Washington social event in late 2017, a guest commented to Kushner on Tillerson\u2019s troubles with Trump. \u201cThe problem will be solved very quickly if I have my way,\u201d Kushner responded. When another guest suggested that Pompeo, who was present, should get the job, Kushner replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d Several months later, in March, 2018, Tillerson was returning home from a trip to Africa when Trump fired him and announced Pompeo as his replacement. \u201cWe\u2019re always on the same wavelength,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe relationship has been very good, and that\u2019s what I need.\u201d", "In the spring of 2018, on his first day as Secretary of State, Pompeo invoked the bluster of the Second World War general George Patton, vowing that the U.S. would \u201cget its swagger back.\u201d The reference to such an undiplomatic figure was odd, unless you knew that Patton is Trump\u2019s most admired general and that the hagiographic movie about Patton\u2019s life is one of his favorites. Pompeo followed up with a social-media campaign that featured photos of himself and Patton, and a State Department logo with a new motto: the \u201cDepartment of Swagger.\u201d Diplomats quickly surmised, as a former senior department official put it, that Pompeo\u2019s opening pitch was to a \u201cconstituency of one.\u201d Managing Trump as Secretary of State, however, would prove harder for Pompeo than it had been. As C.I.A. director, Pompeo spent many hours with the President, and he could punt difficult questions by saying that it was not his role to offer policy advice. Now he would often be away travelling, while Bolton, the new national-security adviser and a veteran bureaucratic infighter, had daily Trump time. The State Department was also in disarray from Tillerson\u2019s tenure. Waves of experienced Foreign Service officers quit or were forced out, as Tillerson insisted on an extensive reorganization plan, instituted a hiring freeze, and accepted crippling budget cuts. The White House also blocked State from hiring any of the hundred and forty-nine G.O.P. national-security officials who signed \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters during the campaign. With State in crisis, Pompeo reached out to some veteran diplomats who had quit or been pushed aside, promoted a career Foreign Service official to serve as the department\u2019s No. 3, lifted Tillerson\u2019s hiring freeze, and consulted all the living former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton, who took his call even though he had savaged her over Benghazi. The gestures helped smooth his Senate confirmation. In the end, Pompeo received even more Democratic votes, seven, than Tillerson had. Pompeo used his standing with the President as a selling point for a department in need of White House clout and a semblance of stability. \u201cThe department appreciates the fact that they have a Secretary who the President trusts,\u201d Fred Fleitz, who served as Bolton\u2019s chief of staff at the National Security Council, told me. Democrats noticed, too. \u201cMorale is better at the State Department. It\u2019s still at a historic low watermark, but people feel better,\u201d Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator who has vehemently opposed Pompeo on issues such as U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, told me. \u201cThere are some silver linings to Pompeo\u2019s time at State that even critics like me can\u2019t ignore.\u201d Yet Trump\u2019s impulsive style created constant complications for Pompeo, as it did for other officials. Trump undercut Pompeo with his abrupt decision, last December, to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria (which led to the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis); his unilateral recognition of Israel\u2019s post-1967 annexation of the Golan Heights (a day after Pompeo, who was in Israel at the time, publicly said that he knew of no such plans); and his spur-of-the-moment decision to cut U.S. foreign aid to Central America. On North Korea, Pompeo was \u201cvery skeptical,\u201d according to a former senior U.S. official, that Trump\u2019s talks with Kim Jong Un would produce a breakthrough on denuclearization\u2014a problem, since Trump\u2019s first assignment to Pompeo was to oversee those negotiations. Trump has made a practice of alarming longtime allies, musing aloud about cancelling the mutual-defense treaty with Japan, threatening to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea, deriding Europe\u2019s largest powers as NATO deadbeats, and dismissing the European Union as a \u201cfoe.\u201d All of this has made for tense Pompeo visits in normally friendly precincts. In Washington, though, Pompeo has managed to maintain Trump\u2019s confidence while remaining on speaking terms with a foreign-policy establishment that is deeply unsettled by the President. \u201cHe\u2019s in a sense become the real adult in the room,\u201d Ian Bremmer, the founder of the geopolitical advisory firm the Eurasia Group, told me. \u201cIt is less the case than he would like, but vastly more the case than anyone else.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s Republican friend told me, \u201cHe\u2019s not an enabler of Trump. He does a lot to try to manage him.\u201d Others believe that Pompeo is merely posturing. He is a politician who knows his audience; he wants to give the impression that \u201che generally agrees but he\u2019s working with this wild man,\u201d another former senior State Department official, who has met with Pompeo privately, told me. \u201cHe always has this sheepish \u2018I know,\u2019 but won\u2019t show his hand.\u201d He suggests, without being specific, the former official added, that he\u2019s got \u201chis finger in the dike.\u201d When it comes to personnel, Pompeo has sent the right signals to the G.O.P. establishment by hiring a few Republican opponents of the President. He tapped Elliott Abrams, who wrote an anti-Trump op-ed in 2016, to be his special envoy to Venezuela. (Trump blocked Tillerson\u2019s attempt to hire Abrams.) He asked Jim Jeffrey, George W. Bush\u2019s deputy national-security adviser, to serve as the special envoy for Syria, even though he signed a Never Trump letter. This spring, Pompeo appointed the Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus to be his spokesperson, although she, like Pompeo, had publicly opposed Trump in 2016, prompting the conservative magazine The National Interest to observe that \u201cMike Pompeo\u2019s house has become a hall of NeverTrump.\u201d In each case, Pompeo carefully managed the President. \u201cHe\u2019ll be meeting with Trump about something else and then, like, at the end of the meeting he\u2019ll be, like, \u2018Oh, by the way, I\u2019m bringing on Jim Jeffrey,\u2019 \u2018Oh, by the way, I\u2019m bringing on Elliott Abrams,\u2019 \u201d the Republican close to Pompeo told me. Trump agreed to the moves, but only because the jobs did not require Senate confirmation. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear he has a deal with the President where if there\u2019s no confirmation hearing, where people can talk about the 2016 race, then he can hire whoever he wants,\u201d a senior Administration official told me. Fifteen months after Pompeo took over the State Department, the question is not whether he has stayed in Trump\u2019s good favor but to what ends Pompeo is using the relationship. He \u201cagrees certain things the President has mandated don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d a third former senior department official told me. When Trump unilaterally cut two hundred and thirty million dollars that was meant to help stabilize parts of Syria where U.S. forces were present, Pompeo \u201cwent to the President several times to fix it. He just lost,\u201d the former official said. He concluded that this typified Pompeo\u2019s approach. \u201cHe will go at Trump to try to change his mind, but if he can\u2019t he\u2019ll go, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re doing what the President has said.\u2019 \u201d Pompeo\u2019s own ideological agenda is also becoming clearer, as indicated by recent controversies over orders to U.S. diplomatic missions not to fly the gay-pride flag; the creation of a new State Department commission stocked with conservatives to review human-rights policy based on \u201cnatural\u201d rights; and comments by the Secretary that were skeptical of climate change at an international climate-change conference. In the end, Pompeo may be remembered as the most conservative, ideologically driven Secretary of State ever to serve. He is certainly no sentimentalist about the world, and, while he does not share Trump\u2019s affinity for dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un, he has remained notably silent on human-rights abuses in places such as North Korea. In Saudi Arabia, he smiled during a photo op with the Crown Prince soon after the gruesome killing of the dissident columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and angered many members of Congress, including some in his own Party, by appearing to dismiss concerns about it. Pompeo and his advisers had thought that the episode would be a repeat of China\u2019s 1989 massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square: a controversy that produced outrage in Congress but then passed. Instead, Pompeo was \u201cstruck and frustrated by how it hasn\u2019t blown over,\u201d the Republican friend told me. Pompeo is also more political than any other recent Secretary, with the exception, perhaps, of Hillary Clinton. In some ways, he\u2019s approached the job like a future Presidential candidate, hosting Republican strategists such as Karl Rove and wealthy patrons such as the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein at regular \u201cMadison Dinners,\u201d named for the fifth Secretary of State (and fourth President). The dinners are orchestrated by Pompeo\u2019s wife, Susan, who travels frequently with him and whose unusual requests are now being investigated by congressional Democrats after a whistle-blower complained that the couple was inappropriately using government resources and treating Pompeo\u2019s security detail as \u201cUberEats with guns,\u201d CNN reported. \u201cOh, yeah, Thrag spoiled the ending of this one at work today.\u201d Cartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian Boothby At times, Pompeo\u2019s concern for his political image can seem to shape policy decisions. Last September, he ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra, despite objections from some State Department officials. \u201cHe did not want Basra to be his Benghazi,\u201d a former senior U.S. official who discussed the decision with Pompeo said. Another former senior U.S. official, with experience in Iraq, told me, \u201cAbsolutely, it was an overreaction. He wears Benghazi around his neck.\u201d", "In a recent speech at the Claremont Institute, in California, Pompeo outlined his version of the Trump doctrine, claiming that \u201crealism\u201d \u201crestraint,\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d guided the President\u2019s approach to the world. It was his most ambitious explanation yet of the Administration\u2019s foreign policy, asserting that renewed nationalism is necessary as the U.S. faces a new era of great-power competition with China and Russia. It sounded plausible, Republican, and entirely unlike the President. \u201cThe problem with the speech is that it doesn\u2019t reflect Trump\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Brett McGurk, a former State Department official who oversaw the anti-Islamic State coalition, until he quit in protest over Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s not based on realism. It\u2019s not based on restraint. It\u2019s based on declaring grand objectives, few of which the Administration is willing or able to meet.\u201d This gets at a central challenge of Pompeo\u2019s tenure: turning Trump\u2019s tweets and \u201cinstincts\u201d into a coherent foreign policy, as his policy-planning chief often put it. Pompeo insists on that goal, though doing so often involves essentially ignoring the President himself. On Syria, for example, Pompeo, Bolton, and other officials disagreed with Trump\u2019s order to immediately withdraw U.S. forces, but they sought to manage him rather than confront him, as Mattis did, while enlisting other allies, such as the Israelis and members of Congress, to lobby Trump for a reversal. In public, Pompeo defended the decision, arguing, in defiance of the facts, that it constituted a continuation of Trump\u2019s policy. Eventually, Trump agreed to keep some troops in Syria. The episode was one of many in which Pompeo has struggled to avoid coming into public conflict with the President. In recent months, Pompeo has repeatedly tangled with members of Congress and journalists who ask about the President\u2019s policies and his inflammatory statements. Such questions, he has said, are \u201csilly,\u201d \u201cbizarre,\u201d \u201cticky-tack,\u201d \u201cinsulting and ridiculous and frankly ludicrous.\u201d Yet none of the people I spoke with thought Pompeo harbored any illusions about the President. In private, Pompeo\u2019s gripes sometimes echo those expressed by fired predecessors, among them H. R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s second national-security adviser. One of the former senior officials told me that he had heard identical complaints from Pompeo and McMaster: \u201c \u2018We put together carefully crafted policies on things and the President blows it up with a tweet, and I have to go in and put Humpty Dumpty back together.\u2019 \u201d Until now, Pompeo has derived his power by being better than anyone else at anticipating where Trump is going to end up and managing to get himself there. As Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, put it, Pompeo has cultivated a \u201cspecial skill,\u201d figuring out \u201chow to get Trump moving in the direction he wants.\u201d The risks of getting publicly out of synch with Trump, however, have gone up for Pompeo this summer, as tensions with Iran rise. The President, a self-styled grand global dealmaker, has said that his goal after withdrawing from the nuclear deal is to bring Iran back to the negotiating table for a better deal. Pompeo, an Iran hawk far longer than he has been a Trump supporter, has been driving the Administration\u2019s hard-line \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy. The possibility of a real divide with Trump emerged in June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Pompeo and his internal rival Bolton, a longtime advocate of Iranian \u201cregime change,\u201d initially backed a retaliatory military strike, and Trump agreed, only to reverse himself when planes were already in the air. Even before that incident, Fred Fleitz, Bolton\u2019s former chief of staff at the N.S.C., had told me that Bolton and Pompeo are closely aligned on Iran, at least. \u201cHe and John are on the same sheet of music,\u201d Fleitz said. Whatever their ideological convergence on Iran, relations between the two seem to have worsened in recent months, to the extent that the former White House official was told recently that they are \u201cnot even on speaking terms\u201d and communicate largely through intermediaries. Pompeo, asked last month about his relationship with Bolton, noted, \u201cThere\u2019s always tension among leaders of different organizations.\u201d But for now it\u2019s Bolton, not Pompeo, who appears to be the odd man out. In a sign of Pompeo\u2019s ability to remain in Trump\u2019s good graces, the President publicly bristled at Bolton, not him, after the aborted Iran strike. Then, with Pompeo by his side, Trump made an unprecedented, hastily arranged visit with Kim Jong Un to the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, while Bolton went off on a previously scheduled trip to Mongolia."], "pubDate": null, "id": "8436a165-e880-3205-a0e9-0dda7054877d", "keywords": ["told", "president", "official", "trumps", "pompeo", "republican", "trump", "secretary", "pompeos", "thayer", "state", "mike"], "title": "Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of Trump", "summary": "In the winter of 2016, Donald Trump was roaring through the primaries, and Mike Pompeo was determined to stop him.\nIn 2018, after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by tweet, Pompeo happily replaced him as America\u2019s top diplomat.\n\u201cMarc knows Mike well,\u201d a Republican friend of Pompeo\u2019s told me, and Short got Pompeo to help Pence with debate preparation that fall.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about Putin,\u201d Trump told Pompeo, according to an account that Pompeo later offered to Republican insiders.\nThe first former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo challenged the agency\u2019s Iran analysts: \u201cHe would ask, \u2018What evidence?", "authors": ["Susan B.
