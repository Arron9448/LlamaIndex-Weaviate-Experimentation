He has drive, and opinion, and courage, and humor robust enough for Mississippi riverboats or the Royal Navy.\u201d", "The prince was born on June 10 in 1921 on the kitchen table of Mon Repos, his family\u2019s estate on Corfu. He made his debut in Vogue in 1947 when the magazine heralded the engagement of then-H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth to then-Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, R.N., the former Prince Philip of Greece. The couple, who shared a great-great-grandmother in Queen Victoria, had been brought together by the prince\u2019s wily uncle Lord Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India and his nephew\u2019s guardian since the boy was eight, when the young prince\u2019s parents had been driven into exile from Greece.", "The prince\u2019s father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg, was the seventh child and fourth son of King George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia. His mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, a fascinating and troubled woman who in later life founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns (and was posthumously honored by Israel for having sheltered a Jewish family in Athens during the Second World War). \u201cIf anything, I've thought of myself as Scandinavian,\u201d Prince Philip told Fiammetta Rocco, one of several biographers of his complicated family tree. \u201cParticularly Danish. We spoke English at home. The others learned Greek. I could understand a certain amount of it. But then the [conversation] would go into French. Then it went into German, on occasion, because we had German cousins. If you couldn't think of a word in one language, you tended to go off in another.\u201d Communication with his mother was primarily in sign language, as she became almost completely deaf after contracting German measles at the age of four.", "Prince Philip\u2019s royal parents had been forced to leave Greece when Prince Andrew\u2019s elder brother King Constantine\u2014whose wife, Sophia of Prussia, was a sister of Germany\u2019s Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2014had followed an unpopular policy of neutrality during the First World War."], "authors": ["Hamish Bowles", "Hamish Bowle"], "keywords": ["edinburgh", "99", "elizabeths", "vogue", "duke", "prince", "husband", "war", "royal", "princes", "greece", "died", "philip", "family", "german", "queen", "world"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
