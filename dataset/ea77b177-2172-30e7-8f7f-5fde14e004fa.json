Instead of making lemonade, I squeezed them over all the liquor in my bar cart, thinking \u201chaving so much fun!\u201d in swanky social settings would dull my mistakes, numb the pain of hard truths, and make me forget a person who I cared for that didn\u2019t care back. It worked for a time. But after a night gone awry, I found myself in an empty train on 4th of July weekend, fleeing what was supposed to be an \u201camazing\u201d weekend with my friends for the respite of an empty city. As I stared at a wall of street garbage on an empty block, I realized I didn\u2019t like myself. Judging by my blank phone screen, at that moment, no one else did either.", "That\u2019s how I ended up, a week later, in Jackson, Wyoming, for my first-ever wellness retreat, seeking the elusive idea of a \u201cfresh start.\u201d I\u2019ve always been skittish at these health-boosting getaways. I get claustrophobic in spas. And while yoga and meditation quiet some minds, mine goes haywire in the stillness. (\u201cIt feels like a million tiny miners are trapped inside my brain, excavating it with a million tiny pickaxes!\u201d I once explained to an exasperated instructor.)", "But this one was different. Because the host, boutique hotel Caldera House, had no formal spa, and no official yoga studio. Located at the foot of Jackson Hole Mountain and on the cusp of Grand Teton National Park, its primary offering was the great outdoors.", "Since the age of Walden Pond and transcendentalism, nature has been romanticized as a path to self-healing. (\u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived,\u201d wrote Thoreau.) Science backs that up. In 2009, Dutch researchers found a lower rate of 15 diseases\u2014such as depression, anxiety, and migraines\u2014in people who lived within .5 miles of a green space. A 2015 study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that those who walked in a natural setting for an hour and a half showed lower depression levels than those walking in an urban one. These revelations coincide with a time when we\u2019ve never been more isolated from nature : as of 2018, 82 percent of North America\u2019s population lives in a metropolitan area, and 30 percent of those with social media accounts (linked to their own mental health stressors) spend more than 15 hours online a week. So perhaps it comes as no surprise that, in their 2019 report, the Global Wellness Summit touted eco-therapy as a top trend.", "It was a trend that I was excited to try. As a kid, the outdoors were a constant part of my life\u2014I loved to run, to ski, to hike. And I\u2019d actually spent a set of summers in Jackson, splashing around with my brother and sister in the Snake River. In the winters, we\u2019d shoot into the glades on skis, stumbling down the steep slopes surrounded by snowy evergreens. But then I got older. There was sports, and school. There was college and required courses. There was the city and my career. And suddenly, a place I once felt close to felt very far away."], "summary": "As I stared at a wall of street garbage on an empty block, I realized I didn\u2019t like myself.\nThat\u2019s how I ended up, a week later, in Jackson, Wyoming, for my first-ever wellness retreat, seeking the elusive idea of a \u201cfresh start.\u201d I\u2019ve always been skittish at these health-boosting getaways.\nSo perhaps it comes as no surprise that, in their 2019 report, the Global Wellness Summit touted eco-therapy as a top trend.\nAnd I\u2019d actually spent a set of summers in Jackson, splashing around with my brother and sister in the Snake River.\nIn the winters, we\u2019d shoot into the glades on skis, stumbling down the steep slopes surrounded by snowy evergreens.", "id": "ea77b177-2172-30e7-8f7f-5fde14e004fa", "title": "Want a Wellness Retreat?
