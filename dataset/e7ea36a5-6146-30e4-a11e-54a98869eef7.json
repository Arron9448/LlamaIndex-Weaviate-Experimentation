The eponymous studio of British architect and designer Thomas Heatherwick submitted a glass-and-maple-wood structure with undulating legs from which plants sprouted. \u201cExposure to natural environments...has very tangible improvements to brain functioning,\u201d he said at the time.

Browning, co\u00ad\u00adauthor of Nature Inside: A Biophilic Design Guide, published in late 2020. The naming of the philosophy can be traced back to 1964, when German-\u200bborn thinker Erich Fromm coined the term bio (life) philia (lover) to describe mankind\u2019s innate attraction to all things organic. \u201cEven just a picture of nature, like a Hudson Valley landscape, will lower blood pressure and heart rate,\u201d Browning says. In October 2019, Browning and his co\u00adauthor Catie Ryan Balagtas helped publish a striking study: In a sixth-grade Baltimore classroom, they installed a carpet resembling prairie grass, wallpapered the ceiling with a palm-leaf print, and dressed the windows with silkscreened shades.
