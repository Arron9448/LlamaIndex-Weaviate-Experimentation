Organisers of the nationwide demonstrations, drawn from a coalition of groups including Indivisible, MoveOn and Greenpeace, recorded 617 events nationwide.", "The protests ranged from tiny to thousands strong. In Concord, Massachusetts, a small crowd gathered at the historically poignant spot of the Battle of Lexington and Concord that sparked the revolutionary war.", "They waved placards that quoted one of the founding fathers, John Adams, who said: \u201cFacts Are Stubborn Things\u201d. That paean to truth was poignant too. At the very moment the Concord protesters were braving the sleet, Trump was delivering a six-page letter full of insults and ranting to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, denouncing the impeachment process.", "Play Video 1:14 Trump impeachment: protesters gather in Times Square on eve of vote \u2013 video", "According to the chief fact-checker of the Washington Post, the letter contained at least \u201ca couple dozen\u201d factual errors or misleading statements.", "In New York City, the historical theme was echoed in Times Square where a crowd of more than a thousand unfurled a giant banner bearing the words of Article II, section four of the US constitution which lays out the terms of impeachment. Shannon Stagman of Empire State Indivisible, an organizer of the New York rally, told Reuters that the event marked a crucial moment for American citizens.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to come out and say we recognize that crimes were committed here, that this president has abused his power and we\u2019re not OK with letting that slide,\u201d she said.", "Big cities and small towns brought local flavors to bear on the demonstrations.

Photograph: Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images", "Wednesday\u2019s vote is expected to go almost entirely along party lines, with Democrats appearing united enough to push impeachment through. Trump faces two articles \u2013 effective charges from Congress \u2013 that he abused his power by trying to force Ukraine to investigate his potential political rival Joe Biden, and that he then obstructed Congress by blocking the testimony of key witnesses before the impeachment hearings.", "Should the articles be approved by the House, as expected, on Wednesday evening, they then pass to the Senate for a trial likely to be held in the New Year. The Republicans control that upper house, ensuring that Trump is all but certain to be acquitted and therefore not removed from office.", "Q&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.", "The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the House. The chief justice of the US Supreme Court then presides over proceedings in the Senate. The president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam", "Given the highly partisan nature of Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 especially the response of the Republican party that has shown no willingness to engage in a process laid down unambiguously in the US constitution \u2013 its political ramifications are all important. That gave Tuesday night\u2019s nationwide protests an extra urgency.", "Opinion polls show the American people sharply divided on the subject, closely mimicking the rift in Congress.
