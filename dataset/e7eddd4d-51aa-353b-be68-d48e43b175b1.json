We\u2019ve officially been granted two more years of useful life. According to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the reproductive years for women in the United States increased from age 35 to 37.1. The study looked at 60-year trends in reproductive life spans and found that the average of menopause had gone up, while the average of the first period had gone down.", "This study obviously doesn\u2019t mean that having a kid after the age of 35 is a breeze. However, I really hope it prompts us to stop treating 35 like it\u2019s some kind of fertility cliff. Hit that magic number and you\u2019re officially described as being of \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d or a \u201cgeriatric mother\u201d. You\u2019re given dire warnings about how hard it will be to get pregnant and all the problems you and your baby might face if you do. Your pregnancy is immediately labelled \u201chigh-risk\u201d and subject to extra monitoring. Trying to get pregnant after 35 is a process that is often shrouded in stress and judgment.", "The quality of your eggs declines over time, that\u2019s very clear, but the current obsession with the age 35 as a fertility threshold is outdated and unscientific. Take, for example, the often-cited statistic that one in three women aged 35-39 will not be pregnant after a year of trying. Want to know where that statistic from? Data from 1700s France. Researchers looked a bunch of church birth records from people whose life expectancy at the time was around 30, and came up with these statistics. One imagines the researchers would have been ridiculed in any other scenario. However, since this statistic serves the very useful purpose of shaming and scaring women it was parroted endlessly. There is, by the way, more modern \u2013 and significantly more cheering \u2013 data to hand. One study published in 2004 that looked at 770 European women found that, with sex at least twice a week, 78% of women aged 35 to 40 conceived within a year, compared with 84% of women aged 20 to 34. The Atlantic notes that these encouraging figures were left out of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine\u2019s (ASRM) 2008 committee opinion on female age and fertility, which instead relied on \u201cthe most-ominous historical data\u201d. A few years later the ASRM also launched a controversial ad campaign reminding people that \u201cwomen in their twenties and early thirties are most likely to conceive.\u201d", "Our current obsession with the age 35 being a fertility cliff isn\u2019t just unscientific, it\u2019s unhelpful. As an obstetrician-gynecologist recently wrote in Slate: \u201cthis monolithic thinking creates stress and a stigma.\u201d Because doctors use this cut-off point to guide the care of patients, you get a barrage of sometimes unnecessary extra testing and treatment once you\u2019re over 35. This often results in a \u201ccare cascade\u201d that can do more harm than good.", "You know who isn\u2019t treated as over-the-hill the moment they reach 35? Men. There still seems to be a pervasive idea that men don\u2019t have biological clocks and can become a dad at any age. However, I\u2019m afraid sperm doesn\u2019t exactly age like a fine wine; sperm quality declines as men get older. Studies have shown that babies born to older fathers have been found to have an increased likelihood of health issues, psychiatric problems and cognitive disorders. Men can be solely responsibe for 20-30% of infertility cases and contribute to 50% cases overall according to one study. You don\u2019t get many men in their 30s stressing about freezing their sperm to preserve its quality though, do you?", "I\u2019m not trying to suggest we shame men for waiting \u201ctoo long\u201d to have a kid, by the way. It\u2019s just time we stop shaming women. If organizations like the ASRM want women to have kids earlier in life, then the focus should be on making parenthood more affordable, not on fearmongering ad campaigns. And instead of making women the culprits for infertility, we ought to be shaming the plastics industry. It\u2019s been posited that one reason infertility rates are rising is the fact that we\u2019re all consuming the equivalent of a credit card\u2019s worth of plastic every week. Fertility is complicated; it\u2019s affected by multiple things and is different for every individual. But let\u2019s just fixate on the age 35 shall we?", "Utah is making men pay half of the pregnancy costs", "Dads-to-be now have to pay half the cost of a mother\u2019s medical care related to pregnancy and delivery.
