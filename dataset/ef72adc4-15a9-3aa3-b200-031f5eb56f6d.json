The sculptor is in a forest near Abidjan in his native Ivory Coast, convening a biennale based on his preferred medium \u2013 wood. But Koko Bi\u2019s presence in Dakar\u2019s Museum of Black Civilisations is hard to miss. His imposing Cedar Men \u2013 four statues of black men made of burnt cedar wood \u2013 sits at the heart of Pr\u00eate-moi Ton R\u00eave (Lend Me Your Dream), one of the most important exhibitions of contemporary African artists ever to tour the continent.", "What his limbless monoliths mean to Africa\u2019s modern art scene \u2013 their sombre heads echoing Easter Island and Mount Rushmore \u2013 was perhaps best illustrated when guests from various countries spontaneously gathered amid them on the show\u2019s opening night. Silently authoritative, they felt like a natural meeting ground for different cultures, the figures symbolising, in Koko Bi\u2019s words, \u201cthe dignity of people who believe in maintaining their native soil and contributing to its development and wellness\u201d.", "This is central to curator Yacouba Konat\u00e9\u2019s vision as he steers Pr\u00eate-moi Ton R\u00eave through the second leg of a two-year tour of Africa. The travelling exhibition takes in seven cities \u2013 Casablanca, Dakar, Abidjan, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Cape Town and Marrakech \u2013 all of which have exciting new art markets. In a chosen gallery in each city, audiences will see work by 30 of Africa\u2019s biggest artists.", "While not all African nations are represented \u2013 Kenya and Ethiopia are notable absences \u2013 the scope is broad, including South African sculptor Jane Alexander, Malian weaver Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9, Algeria\u2019s Zoulikha Bouabdellah pushing the envelope of emergent Arab feminism, Burkina Faso\u2019s Ky Siriki critiquing the economic relationship with Europe, and Ch\u00e9ri Samba injecting the eccentricity of Kinshasa\u2019s streets into paintings filled with irreverent social comment.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Somber monoliths \u2026 Jems Robert Koko Bi and his Cedar Men. Photograph: Fouad Maazouz", "Africa has produced world-famous names in music, but many of its star artists remain obscure \u2013 particularly on the continent itself, where talent leaves to study abroad, sometimes never to return.", "\u201cAll too often the careers of African artists are built on exhibitions in Paris, Berlin, London and New York \u2026 but go by without anybody in Africa actually noticing them,\u201d writes Konat\u00e9 in his programme notes. \u201cWe are haunted by these ghost-like events that create the nagging feeling that Africa\u2019s art scene has been completely ignored.\u201d", "Speaking from his home in Ivory Coast, Konat\u00e9 says he believes \u201cin the power of art [to heal]. But this force is more symbolic than practical. How can one forget that art, especially music, has sometimes been used as instruments of torture in concentration camps and prisons? Artists collaborated with dictators while producing songs that filled hearts with joy. My idea is that artists work for values above money and politics.\u201d", "While on the surface the show feels like a celebration unburdened by politics, you don\u2019t need to dig too far to hit hard ground. Its venue in the Senegalese capital invites debate about foreign imperialism both new and old: the museum, which opened last December, was built with Chinese money, and its directors have joined the voices calling for the repatriation of African art from former colonial powers.", "The show\u2019s title, Lend Me Your Dream, matches the seeming tranquillity of its curation. But there are monsters lurking in the reverie. You may feel like resting your head on the velvet cushion cradling Siriki\u2019s melted bronze Precious Heads. But from these warped, cracked craniums, griot knowledge is leaking out. Siriki\u2019s anxiety is that oral histories are, generation by generation, ebbing away.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The stories they tell \u2026 Precious Heads by Ky Siriki. Photograph: Joshua Surtees", "Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9\u2019s giant woven masterpiece, Touareg Rouge No 1, may look like a lovingly made blanket to warm you from a Saharan winter. But it is a study of the aesthetic, colours and motifs of Tuareg culture \u2013 and potentially a cry for peace. After all, it was Tuareg rebel groups who sparked the Mali conflict that was seized upon by Islamists and has destabilised the Sahel region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.", "Koko Bi\u2019s Two Similar Worlds \u2013 a wooden canoe cut in half with a chainsaw and burnt with a blow torch \u2013 speaks to the dangers of the exodus of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean. \u201cThe young jobless Moroccan man who helped me create it told me he wanted to leave for Europe for a better life,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him Europe isn\u2019t easy and I cut the boat in two and he was so disappointed. I told him to sit in one of the chairs and he felt powerful. I said, \u2018That is how you will feel staying in Morocco and looking for a job.\u2019 We live in two similar worlds and neither one is better or worse than the other.\u201d", "The impact of European contact with Africa is similarly present in at least two other works. In Siriki\u2019s Africa Faces Its Destiny, young Africans approach white Europeans with begging bowls made from empty tins that once contained rich minerals. But the smiling European bankers have come with two objectives \u2013 to dole out wads of cash and simultaneously set up Africa\u2019s debt repayment plan at extortionate rates of interest. They do not appear to notice that one young man who has made it across the sea now lies dead at their feet.", "Mansour Ciss Kanakassy\u2019s installation, Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation, explores how African nations ended up in economic and social turmoil thanks to European incursions. Two giant matchboxes feature a logo of the map of Africa, divided and imprisoned by the columns of the Reichstag. On the sandy beach are matchsticks \u2013 some burned, some yet to be ignited. It is a metaphor for the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, where Europe\u2019s governments, invited by German chancellor Otto van Bismarck, met to carve up African territory and resources among themselves. It won the Senegalese artist, now based in Berlin, the 2008 Dakar Biennale grand prize.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Catching fire \u2026 Le Laboratoire Deberlinisation by Mansour Ciss Kanakassy. Photograph: Joshua Surtees", "Art is one way of invigorating African societies that are now emerging economies in their own right, and the foundation hopes to develop connoisseurship among collectors with newfound wealth. Egyptian painter Adel El Siwi, who presented an eye-catching triptych, believes the exhibition is the most important ever seen in Africa. \u201cIt is an unprecedented event,\u201d he says, \u201cin that it is fully organised and curated by Africans and does not focus on the African diaspora as a central theme.\u201d", "\ufeffBouabdellah, meanwhile, sees it as \u201cpart of a process of emancipation\u201d from privately foreign-funded projects conceptualised abroad, \u201cdemonstrating that south-south cooperation is possible\u201d.", "\ufeffBut as well as optimism about the current scene, there is caution, too. \u201cThe side effect of these trends is that a great deal of pressure is placed particularly on young artists, to produce for the market, in order to sustain their visibility,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cWhich can erode the distinct creative value that brought attention to their work in the first place.\u201d", "Nigerian Nnenna Okore\u2019s ceramic and jute pieces, Earthbound and Bride Price, examine the repetitive nature of women\u2019s craft and domestic work culture. \u201cI am aware,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I am one of only five women in a group of 30 artists chosen to represent the continent. I feel privileged, but not without recognising that there is still much work to be done in elevating the voice of African female artists.\u201d", "Interestingly, two of the five women, Bouabdellah and Alexander, both reference masterworks by men. The former has reinvented Cabanel\u2019s The Birth of Venus in dripping blood-red nail varnish \u2013 an antidote to the male-gaze representation of women in western art. \u201cWhile the French painter shows us a naked body lying prey to desire, I prefer a less virile version, which gives back her status as a woman who is mistress of her own passions,\u201d Bouabdellah explains.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo at work. Photograph: Fouad Maazouz", "International visibility is of course vital for African art to thrive. London\u2019s 1:54 art fair has joined Paris\u2019s Pompidou Centre as a regular platform for African artists, and MoMA recently acquired 45 major African artworks donated by Jean Pigozzi to its reopened permanent collection. It is rare, though, to see African art displayed as it is here, without any trace of ethnocentricity or the normally obligatory accompanying texts about the origins of primitivism and early naive work.", "Painter Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Toguo wants more. \u201cWe don\u2019t see major European or American galleries coming here,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like the Guggenheim or Pompidou to settle in an African country!\u201d", "Looking at the cosmopolitanism and affluence growing out of the dust and bustle of Dakar, this feels like an achievable dream. But does Africa need a Tate gallery? Why should western museums continue to reap the benefits? All over Dakar, small contemporary galleries such as C\u00e9cile Fakhoury, Raw and Trames are thriving. On the opening night of local artist Fally Sene Sow\u2019s show at Trames last week, Senegal\u2019s hipsters assembled in a stark industrial space, reminiscent of Hoxton or Williamsburg, with a DJ spinning electro tunes to an excitable, well-dressed crowd.", "Where once such an event would prompt stares of astonishment, outside on the busy thoroughfare off Place de l\u2019Independence, taxi drivers in their yellow cabs barely batted an eyelid.", "\u2022 Pr\u00eate-moi Ton R\u00eave is at the Museum of Black Civilisations, Dakar, Senegal, until 28 January.
