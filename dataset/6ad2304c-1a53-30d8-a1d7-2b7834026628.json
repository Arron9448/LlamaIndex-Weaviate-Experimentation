Some of these fundraisers netted large amounts of money in a short period.", "After the Proud Boys chairman, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested on 4 January on charges related to firearms and the vandalism of a black church at a previous rally, a fundraiser billed as a \u201cdefense fund\u201d made $113,000 in just four days.", "A large proportion of that money came from a number of high-dollar donors who elected to be anonymous on the website, but whose identifying details were nevertheless preserved by GiveSendGo.", "The anonymous donations included $1,000 from an email address associated with Gabe Carrera, a Florida-based personal injury lawyer who bills himself as the attorney who rides. Another $1,000 which came to Tarrio was associated with an email address belonging to Paul C Gill, a Honolulu-based Hawaiian Airlines employee and former pilot who has previously made donations to Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns and to the Republican party, and who has offered public political commentary in the form of letters to the editor in local newspapers.", "Of Tarrio\u2019s donors, none immediately responded to requests for comment except for Gerardo G Gonzalez, who anonymously donated $1,000 to Tarrio on 7 January.", "Public records show that Florida-based Gonzalez is a former pharmacist who owns at least six properties in Miami Beach and Homestead, Florida. His apartments, apartment buildings and an acreage lot have an assessed value in excess of $2.4m, and in prior decades has sold other properties worth millions more.", "In a telephone conversation, Gonzalez said that his support of the Proud Boys was motivated by his belief that \u201cthere is no systemic racism in this country\u201d, and his opposition to \u201cBLM and Antifa\u201d who he said represented \u201cthe real extremism\u201d in the United States. He also used derogatory terms for Latinos and Democrats.", "Other Proud Boy fundraisers raised large amounts, and attracted a similar range of high-value anonymous donations.", "Following the Capitol riots, a fundraiser in the name of \u201cMedical Assistance to DC Proud Boy victims\u201d made $106,107 on just 6 and 7 January. One anonymous donation for $5,000 was associated with an email address belonging to Ou Yin Lu, a Hacienda Heights, California, resident and businesswoman who had previously donated $14,640 to Trump\u2019s campaign funds, the Republican National Committee and a former California state representative Bob Huff during the 2020 campaign funding cycle.", "Also, after charges were laid on the Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs for his alleged role in the Capitol attack, an anonymous donation for $1,000 came from an email address belonging to a New York woman whose social media accounts list her as a state-employed special education teacher. Overall, Biggs raised over $6,000 on the site.", "Other Proud Boy-related fundraisers included one for North Carolina Proud Boy, Jeremy Bertino, also known as Noble Beard, who was stabbed at a contentious rally in Washington DC on 12 December. Between 16 and 19 December, the effort netted $61,355.", "Several parallel fundraisers sought to finance travel and equipment for Proud Boys who sought to attend the 6 January rally in person.", "Two separate fundraisers asked patrons to fund protective gear and communications equipment for regional Proud Boys chapters, raising $4,876 and $12,900 respectively.", "Later, fundraisers were mounted in the name of individual activists who are now facing serious charges arising from the events of 6 January.", "One that netted $6,475 in just one day was for the benefit of the Washington state Proud Boy and national elder Ethan Nordean also known as Rufio Panman. Another for Nick Ochs, the self-described leader of the Proud Boys\u2019 Hawaiian chapter, brought in $19,687 between 8 and 13 January.", "Candyce Kelshall, the president of the Canadian Association for Security and Intelligence Studies-Vancouver, who at at Simon Fraser University researches violent transnational social movements, said that far-right crowdfunding on GiveSendGo was just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, and similar efforts were happening across up to 54 other crowdfunding sites that her research had revealed.", "She said, however, that GiveSendGo was \u201cparticularly insidious\u201d due to its presentation of such crowdfunding in the guise of religion-based charity."], "authors": ["Jason Wilson"], "keywords": ["groups", "fundraisers", "site", "raised", "anonymous", "christian", "charges", "millions", "farright", "boys", "raise", "email", "boy", "funding", "crowdfunding", "proud"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
