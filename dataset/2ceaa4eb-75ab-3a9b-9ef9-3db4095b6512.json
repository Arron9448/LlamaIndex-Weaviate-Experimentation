bit that balances a sword at the end,", "when they put that on,", "[hammer clanks]", "they just plop it on.", "Well, the tang, that should come through the pommel,", "so there's a little bit sticking up.", "And then you hammer that over and splay it out,", "peen it out, rivet it out.", "And that's what holds everything secure and together.", "This pommel would have fallen off", "as soon as they picked it up.", "So little details are wrong", "but the feel of the thing is great.", "It's magnificent.", "One-handed versus two-handed use of the sword.", "Dark Souls.", "[Gamer] If you tap Y when you're in a situation like this,", "when you have a one-handed sword and a shield,", "you switched to two-handed.", "But blocking with a sword, doesn't really block.", "They kind of completely misunderstand how swords are used.", "[Gamer] It doesn't block 100% of the damage.", "That's just wrong.", "Putting two hands on will give you a more powerful stroke.", "It does not, in any way,",

tight enough,", "the sword won't move.", "And if it doesn't move, it won't cut you.", "So this person is not able to pull it", "through this person's hand", "because this person has taken it", "and

a sword on your back.", "The Witcher 3.", "So here we see a really familiar trope,", "which is the sword being carried on the back", "in a European medieval setting.", "It did not happen.", "The type of sword they're using here looks similar", "to what we would call a medieval longsword,", "which it a sword that you use with two hands,", "would stand about that height.", "You just can't actually get it out,", "a sword of that length over the shoulder.", "Swords are worn in scabbards at the hip", "and outsize swords,", "very, very very long swords,", "are carried over the shoulder.", "It's just that simple.", "Parry's, For Honor.", "So for this one, we actually pushed", "as much as we can, to cover all the parts.", "It all starts by getting the armor wrong.", "By trying to give a sense of bulk", "and therefore, presumably, menace,", "they're amplifying the size of the armor.", "Look at those shoulders", "And making these creatures", "into these great sort of automatons", "who move in a very awkward and lumbering way.", "This idea of wide swings", "and opening yourself up", "and then, 15 minutes later, landing the blow;", "It has nothing to do with reality.", "The art of sword fighting is", "constantly keeping yourself covered.", "They weren't lumbering, slow fools.", "They were martial artists, athletes,", "lightning fast reflexes,", "who had a system, a fighting style", "that was immensely sophisticated.", "Next, let's take a look at axes.", "Throwing an ax, Mordhau.", "What we see here is two types of ax.", "A larger ax that he's using with two hands.", "He takes out a smaller ax,", "which he uses to throw.", "Looking at the armor and the clothing,", "it looks to be more kind of late medieval,", "and both of those axes shown are", "from a much, much, much earlier medieval period.", "From the sort of Frankish/Saxon/Viking period.", "The axes of the later medieval period,", "what are known as battle axes,", "were predominantly a Horseman's weapon.", "They're not for throwing.", "The pollaxe, For Honor.", "[Narrator] They carry the most versatile weapon", "ever invented;", "the pollaxe.", "First thing, the narrator is calling it a pole ax", "instead of a pollaxe.", "The were such things as pole arms", "and a whole family of weapons that are on long poles,", "But the pollaxe, P-O-double L-ax,", "is what knights called this slightly shorter pole arm.", "The pollaxe was between four and five foot in height.", "Not a super long pole arm.", "It's very much a weapon that Knights,", "when they were fighting on foot,", "this was their favorite weapon.", "It was substantial.", "And the top end, it had an ax-head and a hammerhead.", "You know, this was a great chunk of metal,", "so that could land a fearsome blow.", "On top of that was a spike", "and most importantly, at the bottom,", "was this steel spike.", "[Narrator] A secret of their order.", "The beak, and it was that end", "that you did most of your fighting with.", "[Narrator] When they arrived, pray that you...", "One of the great advantages of the pollaxe is", "it has reach and you can really work", "at close distance, at long distance.", "And when you get in there,", "you can use that shaft as a lever.", "They're doing it here and that is right.", "That is straight out of the manuals,", "that you'd get that in there,", "you'd get it behind that legs.", "It's the right spirit of the thing.", "Let's see how bows and arrows are portrayed in video games.", "The crossbow, Mount & Blade.", "One of the cunning things about this clip is", "they don't show you how the crossbow is being loaded.", "So we have this really rather unrealistic rate of shooting.", "There was a thing called a belt and claw,", "where a claw hung from a belt", "and you bent down and hooked that under the thing,", "and you had your foot in the thing", "and you used your whole back to strain,", "and your legs and your thighs were straining", "to pull that string back", "and hook it behind the trigger.", "It certainly couldn't be done as quickly", "as in this clip.", "Loading and aiming, Chivalry.", "There are two stages to preparing that longbow to shoot.", "The first one is what we call knocking,", "and that's the little notch at the end of the arrow", "and getting that fitted to the string.", "In this clip,", "the speed of getting the arrow", "onto the string was credible.", "That...", "I could shoot that fast.", "Maybe even a little faster.", "What takes longer is the second stage,", "the drawing back.", "You're drawing a longbow from your feet to your neck.", "Every muscle is engaged in pulling that string back", "and you pull it back here,", "behind the ear.", "A longbow is a powerful weapon.", "180 pounds, maybe even 200 pounds draw weight.", "The amount it takes to pull that string back.", "This is a massive athletic endeavor", "that has to be repeated over and over again,", "so there are questions of stamina.", "Although, we don't see very much of him,", "we can see part of his archer's equipment,", "which is a leather bracer", "on the inside of his left forearm.", "And what it's for is it's for string slap.", "As the string comes through,", "it just can catch that arm, just get a [indistinct].", "Now, if you've got 150, 180, 200 pound longbow,", "I can assure you that string slap,", "you'll never want to pull that bow back again.", "Flaming arrows, Chivalry 2.", "So it looks great, doesn't it?", "We see these incendiary arrows,", "like the lightning strikes, streaming across the sky.", "My experience with flaming arrows is", "they don't stay alight in the sky,", "looking quite so wonderful as that.", "But they do work and they did exist.", "Does it have any practical military function", "and is it real?", "Well, you certainly wouldn't use them", "in an open battlefield like that", "because it's pointless.", "What are you gonna do?", "Set individual people alight as a bonus", "'cause you've already killed them with your arrow.", "You would use them in sieges", "and in terror raids.", "Fire has always been a dreadful,", "awful, terror weapon.", "Let's look at some other medieval weapons", "that are popular in video games.", "Spears, Mordhau.", "The advantage of a spear is its reach.", "If you've got cavalry coming towards you,", "you can extend it.", "You could go for the horse.", "The disadvantage of a spear is its reach.", "There's that much of weapon on the end of a stick.", "Once you've extended and thrust", "that if the person gets inside that point", "it's easy to either cleave your thin, wooden shaft", "with their sword or their ax,", "or to get hold of that spear", "and wrench it out of your hand.", "Once he's inside the point, the spear is useless.", "Mace, Chivalry.", "Maces, as a general blunt force weapon,", "were widespread on the medieval battlefield.", "What we see here, when they call it a mace,", "it's more like a morning star,", "which is a kind of a two-handed mace with spikes on,", "which came in a little bit later.", "Something that all armor had in common is", "it deflected blows.", "It gave a skidding surface.", "It's very difficult to get that energy", "into the man underneath,", "unless you can get a microsecond of bite.", "So that's really what the spikes were for.", "They look really grizzly and play into our idea", "of medieval brutality,", "but all their for is for grabbing hold of the target", "in order to deliver the energy through the armor.", "Flail, For Honor.", "Their flail is as dangerous to the wielder", "as it is to the enemy.", "I mean, the idea is it's the same as a mace,", "it's a blunt force trauma weapon.", "But its disadvantage is having struck,", "the chain goes limp and comes down.", "You have to prepare it with relatively wide strokes.", "We really have no strong evidence", "that it was ever a real thing.", "We do have evidence, however,", "that it was thought of.", "Throughout the medieval period,", "military engineers and artists", "and designers produced military manuals.", "[Narrator] Sometimes, however, you find", "a diamond in the rough.", "Leonardo da Vinci was one of a long line of designers", "of military machines.", "A lot of the machines and ideas in here never happened.", "Daggers, Dark Souls.", "The dagger uses very little stamina.", "So you can attack many times over", "before depleting your stamina,", "even if you have a low endurance.", "So daggers were pretty much a universal weapon", "on the medieval battlefield.", "Everybody carried a dagger.", "Clearly, a weapon of last resort.", "It's a weapon of close hand-to-hand fighting.", "What I found extraordinary on this clip is", "where the narration said...", "[Narrator] Do note that the range is short.", "I just wanted to shout in his ear,", "Well, let go of one hand", "and you'll double your reach", "because obviously you've got limited reach", "if you're working like that.", "But I've now got double the extension.", "[Narrator] It's about how you use what you have.", "It's one handed weapon.", "It's not a two handed weapon.", "Now we're gonna talk about tactics.", "Taking over a village, Kingdom Come: Deliverance.", "[horn blowing]", "This clip had the element of surprise", "and for any attack on a village to be successful,", "it needs an element of surprise.", "Of course, if you're attacking with an army of that size,", "there's not gonna be any surprise.", "You would hear them from miles away.", "You would see the clouds of dust from miles away.", "So raiding parties would be small.", "You wouldn't need more than 20-30 men", "to raid a village like that.", "They'd use incendiary arrows.", "They would gallop through with flaming torches", "and drop them in the buildings.", "You don't need a big army to attack a small village.", "You do need surprise.", "Firebomb weapons, For Honor.", "[Gamer] Can we get 12 of these bombs?", "Like, that's pretty excessive.", "They had clay pots which they filled with,", "what was really, Greek fire,", "which was a secret recipe developed in 670 or so", "by a man named, Callinicus.", "And this was an incredible flammable substance", "that just kept on burning.", "It could even burn on water.", "[Gamer] Here, take that, sir.", "But running around the battlefield", "with a flammable pot's a pretty dangerous business.", "It's not like pulling the pin on a grenade", "when you know exactly the moment", "you're gonna throw it.", "They really need to be deployed from a fixed position", "and best used in a range weapon,", "like [indistinct] or with a great siege engine", "like a trebuchet.", "Circle formation, Mount & Blade: Bannerlord.", "In certain cavalry situations,", "a circle formation is exactly what you need,", "especially if you're outnumbered.", "The Scots called it the schiltron.", "In fact, they pioneered that technique.", "Not so much, I would suggest against an artillery attack", "with an arrow storm.", "The bowmen only have to range slightly differently", "and they've got the backs of", "the people undefended with their shields", "at the other side of the circle.", "[indistinct]", "Come and get me, shoot me in the back.", "I wouldn't choose a circle that size", "because there's so much room in the middle.", "You could get quite a lot of horsemen smashing", "through the line of two that you've got there", "and they could wreak havoc round the backs", "of the other troops.", "Don't periodically keep breaking your formation.", "Otherwise, there's no point in having it.", "Fighting on horseback,", "Mount and Blade: Bannerlord.", "[upbeat music]", "Cavalry can be used in two main ways.", "You have heavy cavalry,", "smashing into a massive troops for the impact charge,", "and you have light cavalry,", "with swords or bows, or even light lances,", "skirmishing or raiding or just harrying troops", "on the battlefield.", "Here, we're seeing versatile light cavalry skirmishing.", "The weapon of first strike,", "for the horseman, is the lance.", "The long lance over your back.", "That's the cavalry charge,", "but it's a one strike weapon.", "One kebabs each and you're done.", "Its greatest benefit is not just", "the speed of delivering attacks,", "it's the ability to pull back and come again.", "It's that ability on a horse,", "that you couldn't even begin to match", "with a man on foot.", "The stamina of a horse to do those repeated attacks,", "that's really where it gives you the age.", "Let's look at defensive weapons.", "Shield shapes, Mordhau.", "[Narrator] Today, I wanted to talk", "about shields in Mordhau.", "The earliest type shown in this clip is the kite shield.", "[Narrator] You can easily block pretty much anything", "in front of you.", "A sort of Norman-style shield from the 11th century.", "By the 12th, it had already gone out.", "So it has a very limited time period", "to a very specific culture.", "[Narrator] The kite shield is a much larger shields", "that pretty much envelops the entire body", "from head to your shins.", "Gradually, that shield gets shorter and more compact,", "as armor for the lower leg gets better", "and you end up with what's called the heater shield.", "Very good for protecting the upper torso,", "especially when you're on horseback.", "And you need that extra layer of protection", "to withstand the extraordinary force", "of being struck with a lance by a man on a horseback.", "[Narrator] Moving on to the parry shields,", "we have the targe and the buckler.", "The targe, a round shield.", "This one is specifically a kind of Scot's weapon.", "It's smaller than the Viking round shield.", "It had more maneuverability.", "[Narrator] Rather than just blocking with your weapon,", "you simply block with your shield.", "The Highland Scots were famous for their charge,", "running in their kilts across the heather.", "You don't want something clumsy,", "you want something light.", "But they're facing arrows.", "That's what shields are for.", "They're for facing arrow storms.", "[Narrator] The buckler and the targe have", "very minor differences between them", "but function exactly the same.", "In terms of size,", "they have the exact same block radius.", "The type of shield that is used,", "almost exclusively for hand-to-hand fighting,", "is the buckler.", "This was a specialist, little shield.", "Little round shield, completely faced with steel,", "a little steel fist.", "You use it like a fist.", "You punch the enemies' weapons away.", "Swords coming in here, you punch it away.", "Very skillful, but very fast,", "flowing way of fighting.", "[Narrator] The final shield in Mordhau is the pavise.", "The pavise.", "The complete polar opposite of the buckler.", "The pavise is a static shield.", "It just sits there.", "[Narrator] It can be placed down pretty much anywhere", "on a flat surface or even rough terrain.", "It's what crossbowmen carried on their backs,", "set up on the battlefield,", "because they had to shelter behind something", "to work the claw mechanism of loading their bows.", "And it was a question of different shields", "for different fields,",
