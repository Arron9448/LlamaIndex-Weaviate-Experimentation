Now he, like thousands of other Rams fans, felt as if they had been duped. Despite Mr. Kroenke being born and bred in Missouri, he seemed to have more allegiance to his bank account than to St. Louis.", "So Mr. Crouppen decided to pay thousands of dollars out of his own pocket to run an advertisement during the Super Bowl\u2019s half time to tell Mr. Kroenke exactly what he thought of him. He hoped the owner would see it and reflect on \u201cthe bad things he had done\u201d to the Rams, and to his city.", "Judging by what had happened to the Rams, Mr. Crouppen was sure that Mr. Kroenke\u2019s foray in English soccer would follow the same path: the pursuit of profit above all else, especially the fans. \u201cHow much money does this guy need?\u201d he said.", "European soccer fans now have the same sinking feeling Mr. Crouppen did. While they haven\u2019t booked any ad time on TV, protests have been taking place outside stadiums. Everyone is furious. But the roots of the problem can be found at the turn of the century, when European soccer opened their doors to virtually anyone with large amounts of money. And the English Premier League was perhaps the easiest league for anyone to buy a club in.", "In 2003 Roman Abramovich, a virtually unknown oligarch with close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, bought Chelsea FC and sank hundreds of millions of dollars into the squad. They won the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League. That sparked something of an arms race. To compete, clubs needed their own billionaires, leading to a flurry of sales and acquisitions from a motley assortment of characters: a former prime minister of Thailand who had recently been deposed in a coup, a Hong Kong hairdresser turned investor who would end up in jail for money laundering, a Saudi tycoon whom club officials weren\u2019t even sure existed.", "Today almost every English Premier League club is controlled or co-owned by as many as 19 billionaires from 10 countries. In Italy, AC Milan is controlled by Elliot Management, a U.S. hedge fund best known for buying distressed sovereign debt. In France, Paris Saint-Germain is controlled by an investment vehicle owned by Qatar. Each has his own reason to buy a club, whether that\u2019s reputation laundering or, in the case of soccer\u2019s American billionaire owners, the pursuit of profit.", "Whichever country an owner comes from, all now agree that an American-style rationalization of the business \u2014 and the European Super League is the biggest manifestation of their approach so far \u2014 would yield the best returns."], "authors": ["James Montague"], "keywords": ["club", "premier", "football", "americanstyle", "crouppen", "league", "thousands", "rams", "soccer", "ruining", "european", "mr", "super", "english", "york", "times", "money"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
