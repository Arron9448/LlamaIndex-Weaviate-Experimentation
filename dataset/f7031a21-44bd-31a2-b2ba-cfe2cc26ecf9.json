So when the interior designer and founder of Jungalow moved into a 1926 Spanish Bungalow in Frogtown, she knew she had to do something with its empty garage. So she added some shelving. Painted the walls a cheery cream. Threw a fuzzy blue shag rug on the floor and, on top of that, a bright orange couch. She even took on more laborious renovations: adding windows to bathe the room in soft California sunshine, and installing a bar with her favorite liquors. The result? Her \u201ccasita.\u201d", "It may only be 300 square feet, but the casita is truly a room of many purposes. It\u2019s where Blakeney does her virtual workouts, where her daughter paints, and where her husband organizes his record collection. During better times, they used to entertain here. (The casita even hosted Blakeney\u2019s 40th birthday bash\u2014\u201cWe made drinks at the bar inside the casita and passed them through the big window to folks sitting on the other side of the bar in the backyard,\u201d she recalls.) Now, however, she uses it as a home office. Her latest project? A new book with Abrams, Jungalow: Decorate Wild, on sale April 6.", "During the pandemic, Blakeney converted a corner in her \u201ccasita\u201d into a home office.

She loves \u201clots of bold color, pattern, and plants,\u201d as well as an \u201ceclectic mix of vintage and newer items that all have a handmade feel.\u201d Dotting the shelves are vintage ceramics and objets d\u2019art she\u2019s collected during her travels: a terracotta bowl from Santa Fe\u2019s annual Indian Market, a reproduction of Brancusi\u2019s \u201cThe Kiss\u201d sculpture from the Guggenheim gift shop. The bar is overlaid with moody blue tiles adorned with egrets, a nod to her home\u2019s waterfront surroundings. \u201cSince we live near the L.A. river, and see birds like this soaring over our home frequently, I wanted to incorporate them into the casita,\u201d she says.", "The bar area.

She used reclaimed woods when possible, and installed a skylight and french doors.
