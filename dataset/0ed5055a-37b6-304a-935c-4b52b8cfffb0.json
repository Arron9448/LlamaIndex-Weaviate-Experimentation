In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story.", "Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show\u2019s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air\u2019s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed to the Daily Beast. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work \u2013 he told Gross as much in a previous interview \u2013 and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,\u201d Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015.", "\u201cI\u2019ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then wish I could change it, but you can\u2019t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.\u201d", "A New Yorker piece from October touched on what they called Driver\u2019s \u201cphobia\u201d as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling.", "\u201cThat\u2019s when I was, like, I can\u2019t watch myself in things. I certainly can\u2019t watch this if we\u2019re going to continue doing it,\u201d he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d", "\u201cI just went totally cold,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.\u201d", "Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie and others, so Driver\u2019s reaction is not out of the ordinary.", "Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The reasons for this are complicated ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it\u2019s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why he left,\u201d Fresh Air\u2019s Miller told the Daily Beast. \u201cWe were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he\u2019s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn\u2019t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.\u201d", "Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Driver said: \u2018\u2018I just go into a room and wait with a guy in silence, and then I got to go back and sneak in and pretend like I was there the whole time. It always seems like a better alternative than watching all the mistakes that you\u2019re making that are now immortalised on film.\u2019\u2019", "Driver is not alone in avoiding watching his own films. Julianne Moore once has said that \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of my movies\u201d. Reese Witherspoon says watching her own movies would make her \u201cspiral into a state of self-hate\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know who feels good looking at themselves. Nobody, right?\u201d Witherspoon said on Chelsea Lately. \u201cIt\u2019s torture. Why would you want to watch yourself being stupid and pretending to be somebody else?\u201d"], "authors": ["Luke O'Neil"], "keywords": ["watch", "told", "wrong", "watching", "dont", "cant", "gross", "things", "interview", "walk", "driver", "fresh", "adam"]}
