This was fuel to the already-blazing fire of doubt around how meritocratic elite higher education in the US really is.", "The problem isn\u2019t just that the briberies made for an unfair enrolment system. Rather, it\u2019s that we think the trajectories of two people \u2013 one who enrolled in a prestigious school and one who didn\u2019t \u2013 are likely to deviate considerably after that point.", "The other factor at the heart of the Varsity Blues scandal is social justice. It\u2019s not just that some students received an unfair advantage. It\u2019s that they were predominantly white and universally wealthy. By contrast, those from non-white or working-class backgrounds struggle to access the highest-rated universities, for reasons that have more to do with systemic issues than the personal quality of the potential applicants.", "Teachers as 'guides': inside the UK\u2019s first Montessori secondary school Read more", "For these reasons, the outrage following the Varsity Blues scandal makes complete sense. What makes less sense to me is why we don\u2019t extend that same criticism to other education pathways.", "We\u2019ve recently been enrolling our three-year-old into a preschool. After some failed experiences at a local daycare, we opted for an extremely expensive Montessori-style school. The program is incredible, and within a term we\u2019ve started seeing results. Our son\u2019s teachers are nurturing his independence, developing his creativity, treating him with empathy and respect as well as communicating basic literacy, numeracy and all the other stuff he needs to know.", "We\u2019ve got him there in part because we think it\u2019s the right place for him to be right now, given his current needs, but also because we\u2019re confident it\u2019s the kind of environment that will help him grow into a capable, independent person. The kind of person who will succeed in life.", "And we\u2019re paying an arm and a leg for the opportunity. The education doesn\u2019t come cheap. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll be able to continue it once we\u2019re no longer eligible for childcare subsidies.", "I can\u2019t see any way the child of a low-income family would be able to attend without some kind of scholarship. Not only are the fees considerable, there are once-off enrolment fees that cost a few thousand dollars, compulsory working bees for families of the school (there\u2019s a small fee if you don\u2019t rock up) and a range of other bells and whistles. The place is full of compassion and support for kids and families, but it\u2019s also catering to a very wealthy audience, to the point where it feels slightly uncomfortable at times.", "Of course, some might suggest \u2013 rightly \u2013 that you don\u2019t need to be enrolled in a Montessori school to practice the methods. You can do it at home, and there are plenty of excellent resources online to get you started. However, unless you\u2019re a parent who can be (and wants to be) at home most of the time, that horse has bolted before it\u2019s gotten out the gate.", "But for those who do have the time and resources, the approach seems to get results. Not only have we experienced a notable change in our son, tentative research suggests Montessori style education does indeed give kids a leg up in life. A 2017 literature review suggests that the Montessori philosophy, when taught faithfully, benefits children both cognitively and socially.", "What\u2019s more, Montessori education has been shown to actually break down class barriers in education. A 2017 study found that \u201cMontessori preschool also equalised outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes.\u201d", "Do we have to choose between being a good parent and good at our job? | Matthew Beard Read more", "If the research is to be believed, we\u2019ve got an education offering that could actually reduce the advantage gap between rich and poor that is, in effect, only available to the rich. Why?", "The sad reality is it appears to be intellectual laziness as much as anything else. Angeline Liddard argues that the conventional \u201cgrammar\u201d of education is so allergic to the Montessori approach that it relegates it to the fringes, despite the documented benefits both for individual students and societies.", "We can\u2019t conceive of remodelling the education system to make it better, so we tinker around the edges of the system. Those who want to tip the apple cart entirely are left to do it on their own \u2013 privately, and only if they can afford it. And this happens more than a decade before anybody is thinking about university admissions.", "It\u2019s a measure of our attitudes to education that we\u2019re most upset about unfairness in education when it seems to effect job prospects. Inequality in early childhood education \u2013 particularly the kind of education that\u2019s centred on building genuinely human virtues, skills and abilities like creativity and empathy \u2013 doesn\u2019t just promise to make better job candidates. It offers more resilient, curious and imaginative people. It doesn\u2019t just set them up for better jobs, but better lives. At least, that\u2019s the promise (and in our case, the hope).", "But if the promise comes true, then we\u2019ve got the same social disparity, the same beneficial outcomes for students as in the Varsity Blues scandal. What\u2019s less obvious is the unfairness.", "I don\u2019t believe parents are behaving impoperly by sending their kids to schools like this. Nor are the schools necessarily in the wrong if cost-effectiveness means they can\u2019t accommodate every income level. Still, the structures of privilege remain. I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit guilty, knowing our son benefits from an education method that might benefit so many more.", "Maria Montessori wrote that \u201cEducation is the best weapon for peace,\u201d adding that \u201ctrue peace suggests the triumph of justice and love among men; it reveals the existence of a better world where harmony reigns.\u201d This model of peace and social justice can\u2019t be served where education reflects and entrenches disadvantage.", "Obviously, this isn\u2019t to say that those not enrolled in Montessori education are doomed to failure or mediocrity. Really, it\u2019s not about Montessori at all. It\u2019s about the principle. If we have reason to believe a product, a pedagogy or any other resource that\u2019s necessary for individual or communal flourishing is better-than-average, then we have an obligation to make it accessible to everyone.", "Parents have every right to pursue what they think is going to help their kids to live well. In fact, I\u2019d argue they\u2019re obliged to do so.", "But setting your child up for success in ways less advantaged kids can\u2019t access is uncomfortable and can feel morally sketchy. So I\u2019m gonna send my kids to Montessori, the least I can do is demand others have the ability to do so, regardless of what\u2019s sitting in their bank account.", "Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher, fellow at the Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics", "", ""], "authors": ["Matt Beard"], "keywords": ["beard", "available", "cant", "enrolled", "advantage", "kind", "dont", "rich", "montessori", "school", "reduce", "better", "poor", "kids", "matt", "scandal", "gap", "education"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
