Where Posh was about minimalism, Scary was about maximalism. Still, Beckham\u2019s interpretation was a little more refined and updated: Scary often wore leopard jumpsuits or tight dresses in the print, but Beckham\u2019s current design has black lace panels at the waist, as well as thin spaghetti straps. \u201cThis is the perfect summer dress,\u201d Beckham says. \u201cIt\u2019s light, it\u2019s easy.\u201d No word on whether Scary actually inspired her to design this dress, but regardless, we\u2019ll take a Spice Girls collaboration in any form."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["girls", "victoria", "spice", "beckhams", "little", "dresses", "dress", "scary", "channels", "beckham", "posh", "style"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
