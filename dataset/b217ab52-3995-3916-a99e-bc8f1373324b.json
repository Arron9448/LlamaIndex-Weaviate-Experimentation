After his plight made headlines around the country, the VA office in Jackson said it would settle the dispute and is willing to make him a new set of prosthetic legs free of charge.", "\"We have reached out to Mr. Holliman and let him know that we would like to see him again,\" said Dr. David Walker, the medical center director at the Jackson VA, to Fox News. \"We certainly are willing to evaluate him and make him a new set of prosthetic legs.\"", "ARMY VETERAN SAYS HIS PROSTHETIC LEGS WERE REPOSSESSED AND VA WON'T PAY FOR THEM", "Holliman, who is considering taking legal action against the VA, told Fox News this week the government agency had refused to pay for a set of prosthetic legs he needed after a case of gangrene forced doctors to amputate both his legs below the knee.", "\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m thinking about doing. It\u2019s like a roadblock that they don\u2019t want to budge,\u201d Holliman said at the time. \u201cThey won\u2019t address my legs and they won\u2019t do prothesis on them and they not paying me for loss of limb.\u201d", "Medical records show that Holliman has had several ailments over the years. He\u2019s survived three forms of cancer, kidney failure, and diabetes--most of which he attributes to being exposed to Agent Orange, a tactical herbicide used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1975.", "Last August, two months after doctors amputated his left leg, Holliman received a pair of prosthetic legs from Hanger.

Instead, he said he was told to use Medicare to pay for them. He refused that option because he said using Medicare would have required him to pay a co-pay.", "Krisita Burkey, the vice president of public relations and communications at Hanger, told Fox News in a statement that patient privacy laws prevented the company from talking about Holliman\u2019s case specifically.

Instead, he said Holliman went to a private clinic and then to Hanger to obtain prosthetic legs.", "\u201cWe want veterans to use us,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIf a veteran chooses to go outside of our system, we cannot, unfortunately, take on the responsibilities for private purchases and that's the case.\u201d", "Holliman denied that he had gone to Hanger on his own to get prosthetic legs.
