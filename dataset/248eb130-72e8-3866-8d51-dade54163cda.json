You will never have a better chance for drinking it,\u201d she promises.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Simon Hopkinson says goug\u00e8res \u2018provide \u201cmuch-needed ballast\u201d to a festive champagne cocktail\u2019. (Thumbnails by Felicity Cloake)", "For Simon Hopkinson, they provide \u201cmuch-needed ballast\u201d to a festive champagne cocktail, while Anne Willan recommends them for later in the meal, too. \u201cAs one wine connoisseur put it,\u201d she writes in French Regional Cooking, \u201c\u2018goug\u00e8re is not a cheese, though it has that savour; nor a pastry, though it has that appearance. It is the ideal bridge between main course and dessert, allowing the last glass of wine to be enjoyed with delight.\u2019\u201d", "American chef Thomas Keller nails it for me, however, when he calls goug\u00e8res \u201cbasic and delicious\u201d \u2013 because, despite the fancy name, they are indeed pretty basic: a simple choux pastry that can be made weeks in advance, and baked to featherlight perfection straight from the freezer. Perfect Christmas fare, whenever you eat them.", "The pastry", "Choux pastry, the same one that\u2019s used to make profiteroles, sounds more complicated than it is: in fact, it requires very little in the way of skill, though an understanding of the process is helpful. Water is heated with butter until the latter has melted, then flour is beaten in to create a paste. This beating not only brings the mixture together, but activates the gluten in the flour, making the dough stronger and stretchier (helpful for rising), while the heat dries it out and denatures the proteins, so they\u2019re not so elastic that they immediately snap back into shape. Eggs are beaten in to emulsify the dough, the yolks adding softness, the whites strength, followed by cheese or other flavourings, before the choux is piped or spooned on to trays and put into a hot oven, where the remaining moisture evaporates and expands, causing the buns to rise and dry out, until eventually you\u2019re left with a crisp shell of savoury dough. That\u2019s the theory as I understand it, anyway.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest According to the New York Times, Nicole Kaplan\u2019s goug\u00e8res leave behind \u2018a child-like impatience for more\u2019.", "Nicole Kaplan\u2019s goug\u00e8res at New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park were described by Jonathan Reynolds in the New York Times as: \u201ca gossamer of gruyere so light that it can be brought to your table by a butterfly and evaporates on your tongue seconds after making contact \u2013 leaving behind only the sound and memory of a thin crunch, the nutty aroma of milk\u2019s leap toward immortality, and a child-like impatience for more.\u201d Kaplan uses strong bread flour to achieve this, which, according to Segnit\u2019s Lateral Cooking, will help make the dough stretch further. But we find, in amateur hands at least, that it also makes it slightly tougher, putting us in mind of cheesy dough balls, rather than featherlight goug\u00e8res.", "Judy Joo uses a mixture of milk and water in Korean Food Made Simple which gives a better flavour, but a softer finish. Given the amount of cheese that goes in, I don\u2019t think this dough needs much help on the flavour front, but a little crispness is very welcome, so I\u2019m going to stick with the plain water variety. Bear in mind that you want the dough to be as dry as possible, so don\u2019t be afraid of overcooking it once you put it back on the heat. It\u2019s also wise to let it cool a little before adding the egg, to reduce the risk of the latter scrambling.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Judy Joo adds chilli flakes to her goug\u00e8res.", "The cheese", "Gruyere is the classic choice: in his book, Egg, Michael Ruhlman says there is a feeling that, \u201cbecause they are a French preparation, one should use only a French cheese \u2026 I say it\u2019s fine to add a little parmesan to the mix, and cheddar would surely work as well\u201d. I try grana padano and mature cheddar, and can confirm that both work well, as indeed would just about any hard cheese (mimolette, red leicester or Scottish red cheddar would give good colour). But for that distinctive, sweet-salty flavour, gruyere or another mountain cheese would be my pick every time \u2013 and, as Hopkinson observes in Simon Hopkinson Cooks, \u201cthe better quality the cheese, the more delicious the goug\u00e8res\u201d.", "The seasoning", "You don\u2019t need anything more than salt, but a goug\u00e8re is improved immeasurably by a good pinch of mustard powder, which Segnit calls the \u201cunsurpassable flavour enhancer\u201d when it comes to cheese. Joo also adds Korean chilli flakes, which is a good call if you\u2019re looking for a touch of spice (Kaplan\u2019s cayenne pepper does much the same job), while Hopkinson and Willan go big on the nutmeg, which I always think pairs particularly well with gruyere and its ilk.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Eric Lanlard\u2019s goug\u00e8res with blue-cheese sauce.", "Eric Lanlard fills the goug\u00e8res in his Afternoon Tea book with a blue-cheese sauce, which really tips us over the edge; I never turn my nose up at more cheese, of course, but this is quite daringly rich, and would certainly end up down my front after a glass of fizz, so is perhaps better as a starter with a green salad. (Note that recipes for larger goug\u00e8res can be found in Delia Smith\u2019s Complete Cookery Course and Luard\u2019s European Peasant Cookery, among others.)", "Finishing with a quick brush of egg and a sprinkle of cheese will give your goug\u00e8res a glorious tan: if you run out of either, however, it\u2019s not the end of the world.", "The shaping and the baking", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thomas Keller\u2019s \u2018basic and delicious\u2019 goug\u00e8res.", "Though it\u2019s not necessary to wield a piping bag \u2013 you\u2019ll be pleased to know Hopkinson deploys two wetted spoons \u2013 it will yield more even results. Keller\u2019s Bouchon Bakery book calls for the goug\u00e8res to be frozen in silicone moulds, \u201cto ensure they are uniform\u201d; if you have them, use them, but they\u2019re certainly not necessary for anyone but the most serious control freaks. (Joo\u2019s batter is so very wet that I have to put hers into them, so they do come in useful, after all, turning out delicious, almost quiche-like results \u2013 not classic goug\u00e8res, perhaps, but that doesn\u2019t stop us all scoffing them.)", "Kaplan gives three tips for success to the New York Times: refrigerate or freeze the dough after piping, because \u201cit will rise better in the oven\u201d, eat them immediately \u2013 \u201clike topical plays, they lose value every couple of minutes\u201d \u2013 and, most importantly, \u201cif you\u2019re serving them to friends, make millions\u201d. Having baked a batch of the same dough immediately, after refrigeration and straight from the freezer, I don\u2019t notice a great deal of difference, though the frozen ones are perhaps slightly puffier. So \u2026 up to you, but Kaplan\u2019s right on the millions thing: people can really put these things away. (For this reason, I prefer them bite-sized, though you can make them larger, if you wish; just adjust the cooking time accordingly.)", "As the moisture evaporates, the little buns will rise, creating a cavity in the middle; if there\u2019s too much liquid in there, however, they\u2019ll collapse (which is only a disaster for your pride; they\u2019ll still taste fabulous). To facilitate this process, like Keller, I\u2019d advise starting them off in a hot oven to drive off as much water as possible, and then turning the heat down so the outsides don\u2019t overcook before the middle has dried out, taking a tip from David Lebovitz and cutting a hole in the shell to let the steam out in the final five minutes. That said, I rather like a bit of squish in the centre, so you might want to play around with the timings until you find your own sweet spot.", "To reheat ready-cooked ones (hey, you might have leftovers, you never know), put them into an 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for five minutes.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect goug\u00e8res.", "Perfect goug\u00e8res", "Prep 20 min", "Cook 25 min", "Makes About 30", "250ml water", "80g butter, cubed", "\u00bd-1 tsp fine salt", "5 large eggs", "150g plain flour, whisked", "\u00bc tsp freshly ground nutmeg (optional)", "2 tsp mustard powder (optional)", "175g gruyere or other hard cheese, grated", "Line two baking sheets and, if you\u2019re cooking immediately, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.
