Photographed by Annie Leibovitz, Vogue, January 2021", "ON PAPER, THE IDEA of fashion insiders hitting up the local pumpkin patch seems utterly absurd, but on a chilly weekend in October, Paloma Elsesser and her friends find themselves amid an expanse of Dutchess County farmland nestled deep in the Hudson Valley of upstate New York, the stuff of grade school field trips and pastoral postcards. The birthday celebrations for Elsesser\u2019s friend Camille Okhio, a Nigerian American writer and fine- and decorative-arts historian, are in full swing.", "For many in the group\u2014which also includes designer Emily Adams Bode and mixed-media artist Theresa Chromati\u2014this is a welcome opportunity for some fresh air while discussing anything that is not work. Talk centers on the upcoming election, the prospect of apple-cider doughnuts, and the task at hand. Weeks after the farm\u2019s first harvest, it seems that the best specimens are already halfway to becoming either jack-o\u2019-lanterns or pie, so the band of arrestingly dressed creatives sifts through what remains, occasionally tripping over vines and pausing only to film Instagram stories among the foliage.", "Then again, the spoils of the trip aren\u2019t as important as its sense of normality. Months of isolation brought on by the COVID-19 crisis take their toll, and camaraderie can be hard to come by in a pandemic. Elsesser, 28, serves as a kind of den mother, trekking through the patch to check in on everybody. In her black leather cutout blazer from Lourdes and custom Khaite leather pants, she\u2019s at odds with the setting, but the look feels unpretentious, more the result of a hastily packed weekender. Three weeks earlier she\u2019d been jetting through Europe, tackling a most unusual runway season. Some top models opted to sit things out, but for Elsesser the positive effects actually outweighed the risks. \u201cMy nerves were quieted because everything else going on in the world felt so uncertain,\u201d she says. \u201cWith a global pandemic, a movement for Black lives, fiscal shifts, emotional and physical changes, anyone will go through emotional transformations\u2014I certainly did. After five months in quarantine, I wanted to feel centered in my purpose. Modeling is my livelihood and my career, not my passion, but that passion is cloaked within what I do.\u201d", "Elsesser\u2019s passion can be summed up in one word: community. Spend five minutes with her and you\u2019re likely to hear it more than once; the term is at the center of her life, both personally and professionally. Online, her clique of industry friends and fans has united over a shared belief in inclusion, forming a welcoming group that includes designers, filmmakers, influencers, and anyone else willing to participate. As the glue holding things together, Elsesser is keenly aware of what her visibility means\u2014for herself and for others. \u201cWhen a size 14 person like myself says no to doing a show, they may not put anyone larger in that show\u2014therefore that sample doesn\u2019t go into the editorial season; other girls my size don\u2019t get shot in looks that aren\u2019t lingerie or a jacket; there\u2019s a whole cycle happening. My participation isn\u2019t just about me.\u201d", "\u201cNot every part of fashion needs to focus on politics and reality\u2014this isn\u2019t CNN\u2014but ultimately, we all have a level of responsibility\u201d", "Though she identifies as a Black multiracial woman, it\u2019s impossible to categorize her beauty. In one photograph, her combination of curves and composure renders her coolly sensual; in another image, she\u2019s a freckle-faced girl next door brimming with cheer. Her background is a me\u0301lange of cultures and experiences\u2014Black, Latinx, European. More than any other model in recent memory, Elsesser embodies a new and unique American aesthetic\u2014she\u2019s an Everywoman capable of representing multitudes. \u201cWhen she started, there was no one else like her\u2014especially among curve models,\u201d says IMG\u2019s director Mina White. As the woman who helped make Ashley Graham a household name, White knows the hurdles faced by models whose bodies deviate from the industry norm. \u201cEverything was an uphill battle. There wasn\u2019t a \u2018cool\u2019 girl\u2014Paloma had to come in and create her own category.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod", "Annie Leibovit", "Gabriella Karefa-Johnso"], "keywords": ["role", "fashion", "passion", "size", "changing", "better", "white", "weeks", "model", "paloma", "models", "things", "black", "elsesser", "shes", "woman"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
