But what did the result mean for the right? In an essay published shortly before the election, Gerard Baker, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor-at-large, said that, if Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cnew national populist party wins on Thursday, it will be a model that will be studied by ambitious conservatives across the West.\u201d On Monday, Walter Russell Mead, a historian at Bard College, also writing in the Journal, hailed Johnson\u2019s effort to create \u201cwhat we might call National Conservatism,\u201d a \u201cpro-enterprise political approach that is nevertheless grounded in the traditional sentiments and loyalties of the people.\u201d", "Baker and Mead were both grappling with the fact that Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, which was long dominated by affluent residents of suburban and rural areas, now has a big working-class contingent. In the election, it picked up dozens of seats in the north of England that have voted Labour for decades. This development has been attributed to Johnson\u2019s promise of a rapid Brexit and the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. But it also represented the continuation of a deeper trend. Labour\u2019s share of the working-class vote has been falling for decades. Last Thursday, according to a survey of voters by the polling firm YouGov, only a third of the British working class\u2014defined in terms of occupational categories\u2014voted for Labour. The Conservatives\u2019 share of the working-class vote, meanwhile, hit a new high of forty-eight per cent. (The rest was split among other parties.)", "To some extent, the result of the British election mimicked that of the 2016 U.S. election, when many white working-class Americans warmed to Donald Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric, and also to his promises to reduce immigration and protect U.S. jobs\u2014a program that Steve Bannon, his former campaign chief, has referred to as \u201ceconomic nationalism.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian that was published on Tuesday, Bannon hailed the British-election result, and, turning his attention closer to home, boasted, \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party.\u201d", "Despite the U.S. election result in 2016, that blanket statement was misleading: the G.O.P. still has the support of many affluent people, including religious conservatives, small-business owners, and conservative plutocrats. It would be equally misleading to refer to the Conservative Party as a working-class party. The reality is that it now represents an awkward coalition of traditional shire Tories, free-enterprise conservatives, and working-class voters. But, on both sides of the Atlantic, politics is in flux. Amid a continuing dealignment of traditional voting patterns, based on income and class, the major political parties are trying to put together new electoral coalitions and new messaging architectures. The terms \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d \u201cNational Conservatism,\u201d and \u201cnational populist\u201d represent right-wing entries in the messaging contest. But what do they really amount to? And do they provide a long-term basis for holding together the new Republican and Conservative coalitions? The answers aren\u2019t yet clear.", "After Trump\u2019s election, his economic nationalism turned out to encompass a feed-the-plutocrats tax cut, a still-to-be-constructed border wall, and a series of tariffs on Chinese goods which have failed to reverse decades of globalization and deindustrialization. In the past couple of years, the trade deficit with China has risen, whilst job growth in manufacturing and agriculture, two sectors particularly sensitive to trade, have stagnated. As an article in the Times pointed out on Monday, employment growth has been particularly slow in some of the Midwestern states that are key to Trump\u2019s re\u00eblection strategy. Not entirely coincidentally, he has just called a truce in his trade war.", "In my opinion, the President\u2019s continuing popularity with Republican voters\u2014working-class and non-working-class\u2014has less to do with protectionism and economic nationalism than it does with the continued strength of the broader economy, his assiduous cultivation of social and racial resentments, and his unceasing depiction of himself as a foe and victim of the Washington establishment. In this sense, demagoguery and the cult of personality seem at least as important as economics.", "Although Johnson is often compared to Trump, he is more of a mainstream Conservative politician\u2014albeit a very slippery one. In last week\u2019s election, his appeal appears to have been largely transactional and situational: he promised to put an end to the Brexit paralysis, and he wasn\u2019t Corbyn. Going forward, though, what sort of economic panacea can he offer the gritty northern towns that voted Conservative\u2014places like Bishop Auckland, Blyth Valley, Burnley, Leigh, and Scunthorpe, all of which have suffered decades of deindustrialization?", "Some of Johnson\u2019s allies hold up a post-Brexit vision of the United Kingdom as a North Atlantic version of Singapore: an entrepreneurial trading powerhouse. With the country\u2019s access to the vast European market about to be restricted, that is a fantasy. Far from moving into Britain, many multinational companies may well reconsider their existing investments there. (Some of them already are.) By ending freedom of movement into the United Kingdom from other countries in the the European Union, Brexit may well stem the inflow of Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians and other Europeans seeking work, which will please some of Johnson\u2019s supporters. But, on its own, Brexit certainly won\u2019t revive the struggling post-industrial towns that voted Conservative; it is far more likely to hurt them.", "Some observers are suggesting that, to counter the negative effects of Brexit and maintain the support of these towns, Johnson and the Conservatives will eventually abandon their commitment to a balanced budget, borrowing large sums to finance increases in government spending and instituting new tax cuts. Trump abandoned fiscal rectitude long ago, of course. (It\u2019s not clear that he even knows what it means.) In fiscal year 2019, which ended in September, the budget deficit was almost a trillion dollars, and in October and November it rose even further on a monthly basis.", "If Johnson went in this direction, he could conceivably fund substantial increases in spending on the National Health Service and other public programs and combine it with some get-tough policies on immigration and crime. (He\u2019s already proposed hiring more police, enabling stop-and-frisk, and introducing tougher custodial sentences for criminals.) This type of left-right combo might prove popular with many ex-Labour voters. However, it would amount to abandoning the identity of the Conservatives as the guardians of sound finance and the enemies of profligate spending. The Party\u2019s election manifesto, far from hinting at such a shift, pledged that \u201cdebt will be lower at the end of the parliament\u2014rather than spiraling out of control under Labour.\u201d", "To be sure, working-class conservatism (or conservative populism, or economic nationalism, or whatever you want to call it) is now a powerful force on both sides of the Atlantic. But in Britain it is still very much a work in progress, and in the United States it is closely connected to one man, and his appeal. How durable it proves to be remains to be seen."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-future-of-working-class-conservatism-in-the-uk-and-the-us", "id": "b114dd93-674b-3847-a3d7-b3612abf531c", "title": "The Future of Working-Class Conservatism in the U.K. and the U.S.", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["John Cassidy", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino", "Sam Knight"], "summary": "This development has been attributed to Johnson\u2019s promise of a rapid Brexit and the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader.\nThe Conservatives\u2019 share of the working-class vote, meanwhile, hit a new high of forty-eight per cent.\nIt would be equally misleading to refer to the Conservative Party as a working-class party.\nThe reality is that it now represents an awkward coalition of traditional shire Tories, free-enterprise conservatives, and working-class voters.\nThe terms \u201ceconomic nationalism,\u201d \u201cNational Conservatism,\u201d and \u201cnational populist\u201d represent right-wing entries in the messaging contest.", "pubDate": null}
