A quote from Mario Savio\u2019s iconic speech was by then hanging on the wall at the Free Speech Movement Caf\u00e9, more decorative than anti-establishment. These days, at Amherst College, where I am a faculty member, there is a palpable tension on campus. The murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the racism of the Trump Presidency are still fresh. Yet, with the pandemic forcing students to interact mainly through Zoom, the protests are digital and activism is muted. Menand\u2019s article reminds us, however, that student-led movements for systemic change will be ignored at our peril. Rest assured, my students are putting their bodies upon the virtual gears.", "Sara J. Brenneis", "Northampton, Mass.", "I read with interest Menand\u2019s reflection on the legacy of the New Left, but was disappointed to see this nuanced essay about politics in higher education echo a pernicious myth about late-sixties activism: that \u201cAmerican politics descended into chaos\u201d with the rise of the Black Power movement, the women\u2019s movement, and the gay-liberation movement. Such language seems to dismiss the significant gains made by these movements and to cast any violence committed by their members as somehow less pure or less effective than the utopian nonviolence of many New Left participants. In addition, this myth allows one to gloss over the power dynamics at play when some activists are portrayed as dreamers and others\u2014depending on their class, gender, race, and profession\u2014are portrayed as miscreants.", "Hannah Leffingwell", "Brooklyn, N.Y.", "As a student at Berkeley from 1964 to 1967, I witnessed the arrests of the eight hundred students who occupied Sproul Hall. I will never forget seeing a woman dragged down the stone steps by her hair. Although visibly pregnant, she was willing, in the words of Mario Savio, to put her body \u201cupon the gears and upon the wheels.\u201d", "Janet Abramson", "East Lansing, Mich.", "Family Ties", "Andrew Solomon, in his piece about the growing acceptance of polygamous and polyamorous unions, provides an intriguing look into family structures that depart from those of the mainstream (\u201cThe Shape of Love,\u201d March 22nd). He identifies the Uniform Parentage Act of 2017 as a statutory measure that reflects emerging trends. As a member of the Uniform Law Commission and the U.P.A.\u2019s drafting committee, I would add that, though the U.P.A. does permit the recognition of more than two legal parents, the substantive hurdle is high. A court must find that a failure to recognize more than two parents would be detrimental to a child\u2014a more demanding standard than that of the child\u2019s best interest. During the drafting process, our committee\u2019s work centered on cases of de-facto parental figures (such as stepparents) and on the need to recognize legal parentage in order to avoid harming the child. Polygamous and polyamorous families were not our focus. Even so, as Solomon implies, the U.P.A. may benefit the children in such families by protecting their bonds with multiple parental figures.", "Barbara A.
