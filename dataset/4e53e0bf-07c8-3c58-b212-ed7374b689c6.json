A bank of photographers and videographers walked backward before him. A small entourage of aides trailed behind. Fans, lined up for New York\u2019s first professional baseball game with live spectators since Covid shut down the city, called out, \u201cThere\u2019s the next mayor of New York!\u201d and \u201cGood luck!\u201d People milled around to have their photos taken with him. Yang bumped elbows and gave high fives; it was the most casual human contact I\u2019d seen in a year.", "When I asked Yang supporters why they want him to be mayor, I heard, over and over, variations on the words \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cenergy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s energetic, he\u2019s a new face,\u201d said Laivi Freundlich, a businessman and synagogue cantor from Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the old guard.\u201d Some associated Yang, in an undefined way, with technological dynamism. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling,\u201d said Thomas Dixon, a 61-year-old from the Bronx, about how Yang would \u201cbring about necessary changes. Because like the country, New York City needs to move into the 21st century.\u201d", "With about 10 weeks until New York\u2019s mayoral primaries, both public and private polling show Yang ahead in a crowded field, though up to half of voters remain undecided. In a survey released by Fontas Advisors and Core Decision Analytics in March, Yang was the top choice of 16 percent of respondents, followed by 10 percent for Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. (Everyone else was in the single digits.) The Yang campaign\u2019s private polling shows him with 25 percent of the vote and Adams with 15 percent.", "The essence of Yang\u2019s campaign is this: He wants to make New York fun again. He has a hip-hop theme track by MC Jin and a platform plank calling for to-go cocktails \u2014 a pandemic accommodation for struggling bars and restaurants \u2014 to become a regular fixture of city life. He\u2019s constantly out and about, cheerleading each facet of New York\u2019s post-Covid rebirth. He was there the first day movie theaters reopened, taking his wife, Evelyn, to see Eddie Huang\u2019s coming-of-age basketball drama, \u201cBoogie.\u201d But for a kidney stone that landed him in the hospital, he and Evelyn would have gone to an off-Broadway concert on April 2, the day indoor shows restarted."], "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "keywords": ["polling", "day", "city", "yorks", "andrew", "really", "times", "yang", "york", "shows", "private", "hes", "mayor"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
