The problem sounds like a party trick. Pick a number, any number. If it\u2019s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. If it\u2019s even, divide it by 2. Now you have a new number. Apply the same rules to the new number. The conjecture is about what happens as you keep repeating the process.", "Intuition might suggest that the number you start with affects the number you end up with. Maybe some numbers eventually spiral all the way down to 1. Maybe others go marching off to infinity.", "But Collatz predicted that\u2019s not the case. He conjectured that if you start with a positive whole number and run this process long enough, all starting values will lead to 1. And once you hit 1, the rules of the Collatz conjecture confine you to a loop: 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, on and on forever.", "Over the years, many problem solvers have been drawn to the beguiling simplicity of the Collatz conjecture, or the \u201c3x + 1 problem,\u201d as it\u2019s also known. Mathematicians have tested quintillions of examples (that\u2019s 18 zeros) without finding a single exception to Collatz\u2019s prediction. You can even try a few examples yourself with any of the many \u201cCollatz calculators\u201d online.
