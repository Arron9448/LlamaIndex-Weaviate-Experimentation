Chan\u2019s inspired new show, \u201cThe Bather\u2019s Dilemma\u201d (at the Greene Naftali gallery, in Chelsea), riffs on a more joyful Frenchman: the painter Henri Matisse.

In that spirit, a few D.I.Y. experimentalists are joining forces, Sunday night at Baby\u2019s All Right, to continue fighting injustice. This benefit concert for New York\u2019s Immigrant Defense Project includes Active Bird Community, a local trio known for its stirring indie rock; Nick Hakim, a D.C.-bred artist who makes otherworldly R. & B.; Sad13, the solo project of Speedy Ortiz\u2019s Sadie Dupuis; and the wry and whip-smart singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, from Boston.\u2014Julyssa Lopez", "For more night-life listings, click here.", "Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker", "Hospitality takes many forms. At Lokanta, a Turkish restaurant that opened in April, it manifests, counterintuitively, in the blustery bearing of the chef and owner, Orhan Yegen. There are very few people who can make slightly grumpy, brusque confidence come across as alluring and even charming. Yegen, a veteran restaurateur who also owns Sip Sak, in Manhattan (the menus overlap significantly), is one of them, with a reputation that precedes him; the thrill of hearing his dramatic proclamations is one of the draws of his establishments. \u201cIf I was a normal person, I wouldn\u2019t have come to this country,\u201d he declared one evening in May, as he surfed around Lokanta\u2019s dining room. \u201cI\u2019m not normal\u2014I\u2019m an artist.\u201d\u2014Hannah Goldfield", "For more restaurant reviews, click here.", "Photograph by Joan Marcus", "\u201cRunboyrun\u201d and \u201cIn Old Age,\u201d at New York Theatre Workshop, are the third and the eighth installments in the playwright Mfoniso Udofia\u2019s \u201cUfot Cycle,\u201d an ambitious series of nine interlinked plays that build a family mythology. In \u201crunboyrun,\u201d an exquisite work of theatre, Disciple Ufot (Chik\u00e9 Johnson) is haunted by memories of Nigeria\u2019s civil war while his wife, Abasiama (Patrice Johnson Chevannes), struggles to connect with him. Udofia\u2019s script is effortlessly lyrical and rhythmic, but it\u2019s Loretta Greco\u2019s graceful direction and the superb performances that coalesce to form a heartrending story about individual and national trauma. \u201cIn Old Age\u201d (directed by Awoye Timpo) also features Abasiama, now older and haunted by the ghost of Disciple. Though capably performed, this work is more bold-faced but less effective in its sentimentality.\u2014Maya Phillips", "For more theatre reviews, click here.", "Photograph by Vlad Cioplea / Courtesy Magnolia Pictures", "The second weekend of the New York Film Festival, taking place at Lincoln Center, includes \u201cThe Whistlers\u201d (screening Sunday and Monday), the new film by Corneliu Porumboiu, who\u2019s the most original of the new generation of Romanian directors. Throughout his career, Porumboiu has taken wry comedic looks at his country\u2019s legacy of dictatorship and its effect on culture, language, and memory. In his new film, he ingeniously develops these themes in the genre framework of a police story, set amid an international network of drug dealers who use a secret local language to evade the law.\u2014Richard Brody", "For more movie reviews, click here.", "Photograph Courtesy ENSEMBLE / PARALLAX", "Salvatore Sciarrino\u2019s music can be unnervingly quiet\u2014the violin bows scrape the strings, producing rasp as much as tone, and the percussion thumps at uneven intervals like something out of Edgar Allan Poe. Friday evening, at National Sawdust, Ensemble/Parallax and the mezzo-soprano Kathleen Roland present two of his pieces: \u201cInfinito Nero\u201d (\u201cBlack Infinity\u201d), which draws on the medieval mysticism of the sixteenth-century nun St. Maria Maddalena de\u2019 Pazzi, and \u201cLe Voci Sottovetro\u201d (\u201cThe Voices Under Glass\u201d), a more melodic work that reimagines the fractured beauty of Gesualdo\u2019s madrigals.

The piece, created in 1983, was only De Keersmaeker\u2019s third, but its mix of formal rigor, coiled energy, and pugnacity instantly struck a nerve.
