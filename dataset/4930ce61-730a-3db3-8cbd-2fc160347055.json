They are really anchored to the earth but they don't have any negative impact on the environment -- they part of it,\" said Ferdinand Ludvig, professor for green technologies in landscape architecture at the Technical University of Munich and one of the authors of the first systematic study of these \"living bridges.\"", "The bridges stretch across rivers and ravines in India's mountainous Meghalaya plateau, connecting villages and allowing farmers to access their land.

They've also proven more durable than bridges made from modern steel structures that quickly rust and decay in the damp climate, said Ludwig.", "\"It's an ongoing process of growth, decay and regrowth, and it's a very inspiring example of regenerative architecture,\" he said.", "The bridges are made and maintained by individuals, families and communities from the indigenous Khasi and Jaintia people.", "\"In many cases it's a collaboration of all the inhabitants of two villages.

Once aerial roots -- those that grow above the ground -- sprout they are wound around a framework of bamboo or palm stems and are directed toward the opposite bank. Once they reach the other side, they are implanted in the soil.", "The Wah Thyllong living bridge in northeastern India.

The roots can also grow together and fuse -- a process called inosculation.", "An example of inosculation when two roots grow together.
