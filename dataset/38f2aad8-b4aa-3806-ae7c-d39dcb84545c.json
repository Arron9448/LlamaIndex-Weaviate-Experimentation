U.S. District Judge Roger T. Benitez issued a preliminary order halting use of the law known as AB5 to regulate trucking employment, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes, ruling that the state law \u201cruns off the road and into the preemption ditch\u201d by violating the federal government\u2019s primary role in regulating trucking. The judge\u2019s ruling was only over an injunction, and legal challenges to AB5 still have to play out in court. But the judge\u2019s finding that the trucking-industry critics of the law are likely to prevail on the merits includes detailed arguments over federal law and previous cases, adding pressure on the state to show how California\u2019s regulatory effort could be different. The ruling may have national implications since lawmakers in other states are considering similar actions.", "COMMODITIES", "Troubles in U.S. commodities markets are starting to hit the sector\u2019s supply-chain providers. Domestic waterways heavyweight American Commercial Barge Line Co. is in talks with lenders to restructure its more than $1 billion of debt, the WSJ\u2019s Alexander Gladstone and Aisha Al-Muslim report, as the company seeks to steer away from a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The barge operator has been hurt on multiple fronts by events cutting into its core business moving industrial commodities, grain and liquid bulk, mostly along the Mississippi River. Much of the industrial traffic on the corridor has dimmed under global trade tensions that have cut into U.S. manufacturing demand. Rough weather in the Midwest over the past year has also crushed a big share of the grain trade, with floods depressing farm yields and disrupting river traffic during the key shipping season. The company is owned by Platinum Equity.", "SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES", "Food companies are facing big hurdles in their bid to cut plastic waste in their supply chains. Nestl\u00e9 SA is joining the effort with a promise to put nearly $2.1 billion toward cutting its use of plastic made from fossil fuels by a third over the next five years. The WSJ\u2019s Saabira Chaudhuri reports the company is joining several big consumer-goods suppliers that are trying to replace plastics used in packaging with recyclable material. That\u2019s proving to be a challenge because suppliers need high-quality material that is safe for direct contact with food, and much of that packaging now is made from several materials more costly and difficult to recycle. Separately, Microsoft Corp. pledged that it will be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030, the WSJ reports, taking more carbon from the air than its supply chain produces. Microsoft isn\u2019t a major manufacturer, providing an easier path to tackle emissions.", "QUOTABLE", "\u201c They\u2019re going to help create an industry by procurement. \u201d \u2014Julio Friedmann of Columbia University\u2019s Center for Global Energy Policy, on Microsoft\u2019s environmental pledge.", "Number of the Day 20.3% Year-over-year decline in loaded container imports into the Port of Los Angeles in December.", "IN OTHER NEWS", "China\u2019s economy grew 6% in the fourth quarter, slowing to a nearly three-decade low.
