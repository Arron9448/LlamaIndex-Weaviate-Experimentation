I was 16 when I started, but the competition in Los Angeles was intense. My agent right away told me, \u201cNicole, you\u2019re too curvy. You need to lose weight.\u201d I was playing volleyball at the time and she told me to stop playing because apparently it was making my hips too wide. There was already a lot of pressure to lose weight, but I really wanted to make it work.", "That\u2019s when I started dieting and exercising. But no matter how hard I tried, my agent kept saying, \u201cYou\u2019re still too curvy. You can never work on the runway.\u201d So it was her idea to have me pursue swimsuit and lingerie modeling. At first, I was very hesitant. But she insisted my body was a better fit for it.", "Fox News: What was it like working for Victoria\u2019s Secret?", "Weider: It was a dream come true. It was 2006 and I was 20-21 years old. Of course, I was excited. But then I remember feeling so insecure.

I was just stunned. She looked incredible already in person. And if these models aren\u2019t already perfect, then no one is. It was a big wake-up call for me. I realized the modeling industry just wasn\u2019t real and I wanted so much more from my life. There was this constant pressure to be a certain weight, and it was never enough. I was really mad. I fell into a depression.", "Fox News: How much did that moment impact you?", "Weider: It became a period in my life where I felt really lost. I was searching for a purpose. Not too long after, a friend of mine started talking to me about God. I then started praying and reading my Bible. All of a sudden, my life just turned around. I felt like God was showing up in miraculous ways, unexpected ways. Ever since I welcomed God, my life was transformed. I felt like I found my purpose -- and it wasn\u2019t modeling. There was so much more to life than my physical appearance. I don\u2019t think I would have realized that if I didn\u2019t give my life to God.", "Fox News: In 2006, you also appeared in Maxim magazine -- before you turned to your faith. What was it like seeing your photo for the first time?", "Weider: To be honest, I felt really embarrassed. I didn\u2019t know how my family was going to react. My boyfriend liked it, but I didn\u2019t have that fulfilling feeling I thought I would get from that experience. I just felt embarrassed. That\u2019s when I knew I really didn\u2019t want to do this anymore.

You would think being in lingerie on a shoot would make you feel empowered. But for me, it was just making me feel worse.", "Fox News: When did you realize Christianity was the right path for you?", "Weider: I was 24 when my friend first told me about Jesus. At first, I was a little hesitant because I was like, \u201cIf I give my life to God, is my life going to be boring? Will I not be allowed to have my passions anymore?\u201d I just started praying for God to give me guidance\u2026 And I just felt like I needed to try this.

Do you believe things are changing or do we still have a long way to go?", "Weider: I absolutely think things are changing for the good. I think now is a good time to be part of faith-based films. And the opportunities are endless. I think America wants to see more wholesome movies and messages. There\u2019s a lot of really negative movies and TV shows out there. I want to be part of inspiring content that the whole family can watch together. I want to create films that my own son can watch and not be embarrassed by it. I absolutely believe America is embracing more faith-based movies in a big way.", "Fox News: There are some in Hollywood who may be hesitant to participate in a faith-based project out of fear that it will isolate a certain market or turn off some of their fans.

I think being a model really opened my eyes to realizing we are worth so more than our appearance or body. God has something in store for everyone and you will discover your purpose if you have faith. When you place your trust in God, all things are possible. God can open doors that sometimes we can\u2019t open on our own.
