In 2019, The Snow Lodge transformed a vacant space at the bottom of Silver Queen gondola into an apr\u00e8s-ski hotspot: they had the Chainsmokers perform for the X-Games, and Diplo for Presidents\u2019 Day weekend, among many buzzy musical performances. But in the COVID-19 age, crowded concerts are no longer. So The Snow Lodge invested in bringing in a critically acclaimed culinary tour de force rather than leaving the space empty for the season. The standard pandemic protocols are in place: socially-distant tables, temperature checks, a contract tracing log as well as contactless pickup and delivery. Most of their seating is outdoors\u2014Colorado\u2019s indoor dining is still at 25 percent. Yet, they still want to create a safe ambiance of joie de vivre: they are using the aforementioned winter greenery to create pod-friendly nooks on the deck, as well as gilded dividers embossed with playful sayings, like \u201cI started with a coffee and ended with a martini.\u201d", "They see their outside deck seating as an asset, thanks to Aspen\u2019s many bluebird days. Come January, they will have domes on the deck. They\u2019ll also offer pre-bottled cocktails to enjoy in case people would prefer to handle their own service or bring the drinks home instead. \u201cWe wanted to create a more sophisticated environment, where it\u2019s not some big party,\u201d says Pride. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where you can enjoy an elegant cocktail and some excellent food, without it being too crowded.\u201d", "Hot Mulled Apple Cider, one of the many cozy cocktails served by Dante at The Snow Lodge.

They opted for the heavy and hearty: think pappardelle pasta with wild boar ragu, a flatbread with spicy lamb sausage, and chicken parmesan. Paired with a smoked hot toddy or mulled cider, it\u2019s the perfect way to warm up in an alpine atmosphere. (For early-bird skiers, they also serve quite the breakfast, offering homemade banana bread and a breakfast burrito with salsa verde.) \u201cWe\u2019re keeping it safe,\u201d says Pride, \u201cbut also delicious and jovial.\u201d"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["americas", "best", "sets", "space", "winter", "mulled", "seating", "create", "snow", "pride", "wonderland", "bar", "lodge", "deck", "place", "aspen", "safe"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
