It isn\u2019t simply that the canon teems with early birds: Thomas Mann, who published \u201cBuddenbrooks\u201d at twenty-six; F. Scott Fitzgerald, who published \u201cThis Side of Paradise\u201d at twenty-three. There is also the competitive incitement of one\u2019s contemporaries. To look on as others your own age, or younger, launch brilliant careers while you remain unpublished and at large can do lasting damage to the nascent literary ego. The longer it goes on, the easier it gets for the apprentice to view his obscurity as a sign, in Mark Twain\u2019s words, \u201cthat sawing wood is what he was intended for.\u201d", "Few writers have borne witness to the slow-healing bruises of early neglect more memorably than Cynthia Ozick, whose own first novel, \u201cTrust\u201d (1966), didn\u2019t appear until she\u2019d reached the practically geriatric age of thirty-seven. \u201cThere one sits, reading and writing, month after month, year after year,\u201d Ozick has said of her long pre-print limbo. \u201cThere one sits, envying other young writers who have achieved a grain more than oneself. Without the rush and brush and crush of the world, one becomes hollowed out. The cavity fills with envy.\u201d As it happened, \u201cTrust,\u201d a six-hundred-and-fifty-page homage to Henry James, Ozick\u2019s once and future inspirator, did little to enhance her name recognition. (\u201cNobody has ever read it,\u201d she said several decades later, only mildly overstating the case.) In the end, it was envy itself that became the means of her literary ascent.", "In the years after \u201cTrust,\u201d Ozick took a hiatus from the novel form, producing a sequence of ferocious stories and novellas in which her most memorable characters\u2014typically Jewish-American writers, like their creator\u2014are inflamed by \u201cthe anguish of exclusion\u201d from mainstream literary culture. Ozick has been a fervent critic of identity politics since the nineteen-seventies (see, for example, her diatribe against second-wave feminism, \u201cLiterature and the Politics of Sex: A Dissent\u201d), and yet few have written so well about the inconstant self-esteem of the socially marginalized. In \u201cEnvy; or, Yiddish in America,\u201d from \u201cThe Pagan Rabbi and Other Stories\u201d (1971), an untranslated Yiddish-language poet named Herschel Edelshtein wants what his contemporary the short-story writer Yankel Ostrover has: namely, a large American audience. Ostrover, too, writes in Yiddish (a \u201clost, murdered\u201d language), but with the help of a translator he has escaped from the \u201cprison\u201d of his native tongue. \u201cOut, out\u2014he had burst out, he was in the world of reality,\u201d as Edelshtein, who positively vibrates with resentment, sees it. Edelshtein\u2019s psychology, like that of all Ozick\u2019s outsiders, is dense with humiliating paradox. On the one hand, Yiddish and the obliterated culture of European Jewry it evokes are what give meaning to his life; on the other, they are a ghetto from which he yearns to break free into a wider American reality. He despises Ostrover for being a sellout even as he yearns to become him.", "Ozick\u2019s stories from this period\u2014there were also those collected in \u201cBloodshed and Three Novellas\u201d (1976) and \u201cLevitation: Five Fictions\u201d (1982)\u2014didn\u2019t win her an Ostrover-sized readership, but they marked an artistic coming of age. The influence of James was still apparent in her sumptuous phrase-making and labyrinthine syntax, but now it was tempered by more vernacular rhythms. (\u201cI would like to make a good strong b.m. on your friend Ostrover\u201d is not the kind of remark you would find in a story by the Master.) Thematically, too, Ozick was staking out her own distinctive terrain. She\u2019d come to recognize her youthful worship of James as a form of idolatry, a sin under Jewish law. For Ozick, this wasn\u2019t a matter of theological nitpicking but one of pressing moral concern. \u201cWhen we see a little girl who is dressed up too carefully in starched flounces and ribbons and is admonished not to run in the dirt, we often say, \u2018She looks like a little doll,\u2019 \u201d Ozick wrote in an essay from the late seventies, explaining her investment in the subject. \u201cAnd that is what she has been made into: the inert doll has become the model for the human child, dead matter rules the quick. That dead matter will rule the quick is the single law of idolatry.\u201d From Edelshtein, whose devotion to Yiddish induces a paralyzing contempt for the uninitiated, to Rosa Lublin in \u201cThe Shawl\u201d (1989), a semi-lucid Holocaust survivor who persists in writing letters to her daughter, long since murdered by the Nazis, Ozick\u2019s characters make idols of their passions, and in the process transform themselves into living dolls.", "Ozick has avoided this fate. Five and a half decades after her belated d\u00e9but, she has established herself as one of our era\u2019s central writers, with an ample supply of exquisite fiction and belles-lettres; and she is still going. To publish a novel in your early twenties is impressive; to publish one at the age of ninety-three is something else altogether. That is the age that Ozick turns on April 17th, a few days after the publication date of her latest book, which bears the self-ironic title \u201cAntiquities\u201d (Knopf). A brisk work of some thirty thousand words, it explores her favorite subjects\u2014envy and ambition, the moral peril of idolatry\u2014in her favorite form. As you might expect, it also has much to say about last things, and the long perspectives open to the human mind as it approaches its terminus.", "\u201cThe limitless void that awaits us\u201d is much on the mind of Ozick\u2019s narrator, as well it might be. Lloyd Wilkinson Petrie, a retired lawyer, is getting on in years. It is 1949, and Petrie has come to live at Temple Academy, the esteemed Westchester boarding school he attended in his youth. The school, long defunct, has lately been converted into a retirement home for its trustees, all former pupils. Each has agreed to write a short memoir of his school days as part of a sort of institutional history. What sounds like a harmless exercise in group nostalgia soon takes on an air of the macabre as Petrie\u2019s recollections bring into the light things better left in darkness.", "A person \u201cof lineage,\u201d Petrie likes to dwell on his gentle ancestry, though not all of it makes for happy contemplation. In 1880, before Petrie\u2019s birth, his father, a man \u201cenamored\u201d of the ancient world, abandoned his young wife and his position at the family law firm to go in search of a distant relative, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, a renowned archeologist, who at the time was excavating the Great Pyramid of Giza. Although he came home after several months and lived out his days as a conventional family man, his \u201cmad episode\u201d\u2014which was \u201crarely alluded to and never defined\u201d\u2014dealt a psychic blow to his wife and son. Decades later, Petrie still recalls how his father would gaze at the glass cabinet that housed the artifacts he\u2019d brought back with him from Egypt: \u201cI was always a little afraid of him during these motionless scenes, when he seemed as wooden and lifeless as one of my toy soldiers.\u201d Upon his father\u2019s early death, Petrie inherited these ancient idols.", "As a member of the tight-lipped, politely anti-Semitic Wasp establishment, Petrie is hardly your standard Ozick protagonist. What he offers her, it seems, is a way of tackling Judeophobia from the other side. Temple Academy, Petrie explains, was constructed on a plot of land that had previously belonged to the illustrious Temple family, cousins of Henry James, and was, in Petrie\u2019s smugly euphemistic terms, \u201cpremised on English religious and scholarly principles.\u201d But try telling that to the local riffraff, who suspected \u201cthat \u2018Temple\u2019 signified something unpleasantly synagogical, so that on many a Sunday morning the chapel\u2019s windows (those precious panels of stained glass depicting the Jerusalem of Jesus\u2019 time) were discovered to have been smashed overnight.\u201d", "Petrie\u2019s narrative turns on his relationship with a quiet, elusive classmate, Ben-Zion Elefantin, one of a handful of Jewish students who were admitted in the eighteen-nineties under the auspices of a liberal headmaster. Petrie, in spite of his well-bred bigotry, is drawn to Elefantin, whose olive skin tone and unusual accent make him an object of suspicion and ridicule. A wary friendship blossoms, even though this means that Petrie himself becomes a pariah by association. Mostly the two boys just direct silences at each other from across a chessboard, until one afternoon, following an argument about the artifacts Petrie inherited from his father (\u201cYou know nothing of Egypt,\u201d his friend exclaims in a sudden fit of pique), Elefantin reveals an astonishing secret: he is, he says, descended from a little-known colony of Jews who lived on Elephantine Island, in the Nile, sometime in the fifth century B.C.E.", "\u201cThe store was out of eggs, so we\u2019re dyeing my roots instead.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Ali Solomon", "It\u2019s here, around the halfway point, that Ozick begins to move through the gears of her formidable imagination, introducing a tincture of magic to what has so far been a piece of fairly standard realism. In a bravura monologue, which Petrie cautions is an imperfect reconstruction, Elefantin recounts the story of his people\u2014a story that, he claims, official Jewish sources have distorted and obscured. Far from being the wayward band of polytheist mercenaries that scholars have described, the Elephantine Jews, alone among the tribes of Israel, \u201cwere unyieldingly faithful\u201d to the teachings of Moses. Elefantin\u2019s parents, who pass themselves off as traders in antiquities, are really \u201cpilgrims in search of a certain relic of our heritage.\u201d Their peripatetic life style is the reason Elefantin has been enrolled at Temple Academy, which is only the latest in a series of makeshift homes he\u2019s had to put up with during his young life.", "Divided by ethnicity, Petrie and Elefantin are thus really secret sharers, the neglected children of parents who, in different ways, have made an idol of the past. Petrie wonders whether the relic his friend\u2019s parents have been searching for might be among his father\u2019s heirlooms, but Elefantin refuses to examine them. At length, the two classmates drift apart. Looking back on this time from the other end of his life, Petrie wonders what became of Elefantin. \u201cToday he is no more than an illusion, and perhaps he was an illusion then.\u201d", "Is Elefantin\u2019s story true? Although the Elephantine Jews, like Sir Flinders Petrie, belong to the historical record, his claims about their willful misrepresentation by \u201cfalsifying scholars\u201d belong solely to Ozick\u2019s novella. Those claims, set forth in mesmeric detail, certainly have a ring of credibility; at the same time, the book supplies enough internal evidence to suggest they may be little more than a lonely child\u2019s precocious daydream. Elefantin wouldn\u2019t be the first of Ozick\u2019s characters to channel a desire for belonging and identity into personal mythmaking. In \u201cThe Messiah of Stockholm\u201d (1987), another short work that deftly fuses fable and psychology, Lars Andemening, an isolated, middle-aged book reviewer in the Swedish capital, believes himself to be the son of the Polish-Jewish writer Bruno Schulz, who perished in the Holocaust. This makes Andemening an easy mark for quacks and grifters, and yet the book also accords his fantasy a certain tender respect.", "In \u201cAntiquities,\u201d there seems to be as much at stake for Petrie in the legend of the Elephantines as there is for Elefantin himself. A friendless widower with an estranged adult son who tells himself stories about his past accomplishments in a desperate effort to evade self-knowledge, Petrie is the descendant of a long line of unreliable narrators which includes Ford Madox Ford\u2019s John Dowell and Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Mr. Stevens. \u201cI am not a jealous man,\u201d Petrie insists at one point. \u201cAs the heir and partner of a highly reputable law firm, I have never had a reason to envy. Rather, throughout my career, others have envied me.\u201d Or so he likes to think. Petrie boasts of the \u201cconsiderable esteem\u201d he has earned \u201cin the civic arena,\u201d but by 1949 this civic arena is starting to look very different from the way it had in his youth. F.D.R., that traitor to his class, whom Petrie says he voted against four times, and the transformative impact of the Second World War, have begun to chip away at Wasp hegemony; American Jews are rising through the professional ranks. Another of Petrie\u2019s Jewish schoolmates, Ned Greenhill, is now a district-court judge in New York. Greenhill\u2019s son is a wealthy property developer who ends up buying Temple Academy when it runs into financial trouble, forcing Petrie to find another home. Normally, in Ozick\u2019s work, it is the Jewish characters who envy their more assimilated brethren, or even Gentiles themselves; for Petrie, this dynamic has been stingingly inverted.", "More obliquely, Petrie also envies Elefantin, whose origin story seems to connect him to something eternal and transcendent, an escape hatch from history\u2019s humiliating reversals. Confronted by his failings as a human being and the impending expiration of the patrician values by which he\u2019s lived, Petrie can at least say that he was \u201cElefantin\u2019s Boswell,\u201d a man who, if not himself remarkable, encountered someone who was and is leaving a record of it for future generations. Of course, if it transpired that Elefantin\u2019s story was false, then Petrie would be deprived of even that consolation. This appears to be the reason he has waited so long to record his memories of his schoolmate and subject them to scrutiny, and why finally doing so causes him such grief. \u201cI am, if I may express it so, in a state of suffering of the soul as I write,\u201d he says, somewhat histrionically, even as he deplores what he sees as the Jewish tendency toward \u201coverflowing sentimentalism\u201d and a \u201cmotion picture style of exaggerated feeling.\u201d"], "authors": ["Giles Harvey", "Giles Harve"], "keywords": ["ozicks", "idols", "jewish", "petrie", "little", "smasher", "temple", "long", "envy", "age", "elefantin", "ozick", "cynthia"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
