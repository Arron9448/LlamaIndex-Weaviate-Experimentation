Biden has selected William J. Burns, a career State Department official who led the U.S. delegation in secret talks with Iran, to run the Central Intelligence Agency.", "In selecting Mr. Burns, Mr. Biden is turning to an experienced diplomat with whom he has a long relationship. The two men have worked together on various foreign policy issues, not just during the Obama administration, but also while Mr. Biden led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.", "Mr. Biden\u2019s choice sends a message that American intelligence will not be influenced by politics.", "In a statement early Monday, the president-elect said that Mr. Burns \u201cshares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect.\u201d", "Still, Mr. Burns\u2019 experience is as a consumer of intelligence, not as a producer. C.I.A. directors are expected to put aside their policy recommendations and focus on information and prediction. But former agency officials have asserted the most important quality in a director is not expertise in intelligence, but a relationship with the president, which Mr. Burns has.", "During his presidency, President Trump has undermined and dismissed intelligence officials and has called them \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cna\u00efve\u201d in their analysis of national security threats posed by Iran.", "Currently Mr. Burns is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

In 2002, Mr. Burns wrote a memo called the \u201cPerfect Storm,\u201d that highlighted the dangers of American intervention in Iraq.", "Mr. Burns retired from the State Department in 2014.", "For a time Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the agency, was considered the leading candidate for the C.I.A. post. But some Democratic senators voiced public and private reservations. Senate liberals, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, opposed Mr. Morell, a former deputy director of the agency, accusing him of defending torture. Mr. Morell\u2019s representatives said Mr. Wyden had inaccurately portrayed his record and comments about the C.I.A. interrogation program. Earlier, Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser to President Barack Obama, withdrew his name from consideration for the post. David Cohen, a former deputy director of the C.I.A., had also been considered.", "A key question will be how Mr. Burns works with Avril D.
