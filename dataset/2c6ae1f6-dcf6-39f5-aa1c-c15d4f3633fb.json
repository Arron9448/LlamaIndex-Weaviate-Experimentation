Hi, how are you Dan?", "Good, to see you guys.", "So, okay,", "so I'll just to sort of bring", "our listeners up to speed here.", "I got interested in this topic a couple of years ago,", "when, after the horrific fires in 2018,", "and I had about that time to go to the mountains a lot,", "I had noticed that about 150 million trees had died", "and from Sierra,", "and I got thinking what happens when all 150 million trees", "we're going to see some really big fires", "and that led me into kind of discovering", "that the world that you guys live in full time,", "[indistinct voice]", "or have been aware for quite a long time", "that we are already have the stain of finally getting", "[indistinct voice]", "into the worse.", "And so one of the things I was sort", "of most delighted to discover,", "when I connect with a lot", "of there's very little work already been done,", "both make sense of kinds of fires", "[indistinct voice]", "to figure out how to monitor and", "to make potentially useful predictions for the future", "about the kind of the kind we might see.", "And so to that end, David,", "why don't you start a little by just telling us", "about the the genesis", "of pyregence.", "So the California Energy Commission,", "put out a call", "to help identify,", "how to build the next generation", "of wildfire models.", "The state itself,", "California itself is dealing with wildfires on an ongoing", "basis,", "you see it in the news,", "it's a major problem.", "And it's a major problem,", "not only for the utilities,", "but for people in the environment.", "And so what we ended up doing,", "there was a large scientific community,", "wildfire scientific community,", "we decided to band together and go after this proposal", "as a large consortium in a way that's open and transparent.", "And we're co learning could occur not only", "within the scientific community itself,", "but within specific stakeholders starting with the state", "that I use and the general public.", "Very exciting.", "It's building a huge table,", "that we're able to bring a bunch", "of scientists around in a transparent and open way", "to have the hard conversations that are needed in", "this time of great change time of great change", "in terms of climate,", "in terms of policies,", "and in terms of the environment itself.", "And Leroy,", "about telling me about you so you run one of", "one of several working groups within this consortium,", "sort of research working groups", "within the pyregence Consortium.", "Tell me about your working group and some", "of the sort of big and difficult unexplained questions", "about", "or I'm sorry, unanswered questions,", "some of the the questions that you,", "you've been working to answer", "about the wildfire predicament in California.", "Sure.", "So I lead working group for and working group for", "is basically responsible for the long term projections.", "So pyregence as a whole is looking at everything", "from analysis of historical extreme fires, and then,", "hourly to multi day outlooks, seasonal forecasts,", "and then long term projections out to the end", "of the 21st century.", "And we are really tasked with trying to understand how,", "to resolve some of the uncertainties and allow the state", "and communities across California,", "to manage risks around wildfire going forward.", "And some of the biggest constraints", "have been when we're doing these models.", "We're putting them together based on what we understand", "about fires in the recent past especially,", "because that's when we have the most data,", "but then we're projecting forward into a time", "where the climate extremes can far exceed what's been", "observed in the recent past.", "So we have to understand not just", "how well our models work,", "reproducing the past that we've observed recently,", "but how they behave in the future in novel climates", "and interaction between those novel climates", "and say how we manage the landscape,", "and future development footprint.", "And so some of the biggest challenges have been how", "to incorporate things like those lightning strikes,", "so we had this year.", "[laughs]", "You don't we don't predict where lightning", "is going to strike.", "But we have to understand how that adds to that", "variability in that risk.", "Or there are tens of millions of dead trees", "in the Sierra Nevada from the beetle outbreaks", "and severe drought that we had", "in the last decade.", "And so we're trying to understand how to incorporate", "that into our modeling as well,", "so that we can see what future fires would look like.", "And these really altered fuels from tens of millions.", "So one of the things", "that I think,", "has perhaps not been,", "in my view,", "quite enough of the public conversation around wildfire in", "California is that,", "we tend to look toward", "in the media,", "we tend to look toward fairly easy metrics to measure", "how bad wildfires are like by saying,", "the easiest one, of course,", "is sheer acres burned.", "And yes, are wildfires in California", "are getting bigger, very quickly,", "year after year in terms", "of sheer acres burned.", "But really, they don't.", "In terms of the", "total acreage burned across the state every year,", "we're still pretty far behind where California was", "as a natural system 100 years ago,", "in terms of annual acres burned.", "And it seems it seems to me that in some ways,", "the really more astonishing metric,", "and the one that tells us more", "about why wildfire has become so incredibly disruptive", "in our lives in recent years,", "is the sheer severity", "of the fires,", "that we're seeing the the extreme rate", "of fire spread the extreme rate of energy release some", "sort of strange weather phenomenon around fire.", "And so, David,", "why don't why don't you talk", "to me a little bit about how those questions about,", "how that aspect of fire change in California plays", "into the research that pyregence is doing.", "And the sort of insights?", "Yeah,", "That's a great question.", "So like, I mean,", "you hit the nail", "on the head, it's,", "the size and severity of fire is important,", "but the nature of fire itself,", "how these large wildfires are changing and evolving", "on the landscape is also important.", "And so the royalty to the fact", "that he's the lead", "in our working group for which is focused", "on our long term projections.", "Chris lon burgers in charge", "of our work group three,", "which is in charge", "of our short term projection for the nature", "of fire itself,", "we have broken up", "into two separate working groups, right,", "we have one, Janice Cohen,", "that's leading extreme fire weather, right,", "plume draw driven events,", "what creates that what causes them?", "What are the atmospheric climatological conditions that are", "important to understand,", "and we look at wildfire and the interactions,", "with the weather now,", "and with the changing climate", "in the future.", "We also have another Working Group.", "That's led by Scott Stevens,", "John Battles and Mark Finney,", "that's looking at fuel loading, right.", "So the fuel loading conditions", "are also changing over time.", "And we're seeing that,", "back to A.LeRoy is talking about the loads", "and the forests are at a level that are,", "outside of our historic norms.", "And we don't have any points in history", "where we could look to see examples of it.", "So folks like Finney are looking at examples", "of like dressed in our hair Shima,", "to look at firestorms that occurred in those environments", "to see if they can capture some of the physics", "involved in that and see how we can integrate that", "into our existing understanding", "of wildfire models.", "You switch over to where Janice is looking at things", "and her group.", "It's not,", "wildfires not ubiquitous across the state,", "you could kind of think of it", "in the most general terms", "as different fire types,", "but I like to call fire nature that", "are sprinkled across the different state,", "some of our models", "are really good at nailing them down.", "And the surface weather surface wind driven events,", "or rathmell based models", "are pretty good at capturing them.", "In the simplest terms,", "if you want to call plume driven events,", "we don't have models that can capture", "that we need to understand the basic physics we need", "to build the models right now to be able", "to scale up and capture", "Sorry.", "[indistinct voice]", "LeRoy let me just step into it.", "Let me just step into clarify", "one thing for our for our listeners", "that the what we mean by plume Driven events are", "these are these wildfires that become big enough", "that they're they generate a big enough convective column,", "big enough sort of column of heat", "and smoke rising up from the fire,", "that that column begins", "to generate its own weather.", "And it began, most importantly,", "it begins to drive,", "the sort of core phenomenon is this way", "in which it can drive a sort", "of 360 degree radial wind field,", "into the fire itself.", "So that as if the fire is found a way", "to stoke itself,", "and to dry,", "hotter and faster.", "And Leroy the and so,", "let's be sure to touch", "on two things.", "One is, we were you've spent a lot of time studying", "how climate change interacts,", "with our sort of forest management practices", "and wildfire behavior.", "So and I think one of the questions", "that's been really getting wrestled with a lot", "in the last few weeks is precisely that one.", "So how about airing out for us the relationship", "between things like forest management practices,", "which is to say, logging, not logging,", "thinning, prescribed burns,", "and climate change?", "And then ultimately,", "the kinds of fire behaviors", "that we're seeing?", "Yeah, and I also want", "to address quickly,", "one thing you just said,", "when you're asking the question to David,", "and that was saying,", "comparing what we currently are looking at", "to what you call the natural fire regime.", "And I think it's important to keep in mind", "that that was a fire regime that", "was also managed by people. Yeah.", "And so a lot of the area additional area burned", "in the state was fires that were set", "to manage the landscape for different objectives.", "And very different from the fires we're seeing today,", "which are enhanced in some places by the interaction", "between some of the impacts of climate change,", "and the legacy of increased fuels", "on the landscape,", "from past fire suppression,", "but also changes in land use,", "like grazing or fragmentation", "of the landscape.", "And so people often will point", "to that fuels management issue,", "because it's a very graphically obvious thing.", "If you look at photographs of 100 years ago versus today,", "you can see really characteristic changes in the", "in the structure of forests throughout the middle of Asians", "and Sierra Nevada.", "And those increased fuels", "or have made those forests more susceptible", "to climate change.", "So as you warm up the planet, right,", "you're evaporating more moisture,", "this is an arid region.", "So there's not like an excess reservoir of moisture", "that can compensate for that.", "And we're not changing precipitation that much, so far, so.", "So that's drawing more moisture out", "of those ecosystems out", "of those fuels.", "And in places where the forest has gotten really", "overcrowded,", "shall we say,", "you have that exacerbated by competition for moisture", "between the trees.", "In addition, we have increased a fraction of the", "precipitation that we get comes", "as rain unless it's snow.", "And the snow melts out earlier,", "because there's less of it often.", "And because of temperatures in spring and warmer,", "so that can make the fire season at higher elevations come", "earlier.", "And then one of the factors has been really important at", "lower elevations", "where most people in California live and typically not", "forested", "is increased variability in precipitation.", "So as you warm up the planet,", "you're changing the temperature difference between the", "higher latitudes and the equator,", "that changes the atmospheric circulation patterns.", "And we often see in projections,", "and now in some observations is increased frequencies,", "or slower weather patterns set up,", "wet or dry,", "cold or hot for a longer period of time.", "And that just increases the extremes.", "And in particular,", "we've seen in recent years,", "a lot of bottoms", "where the typical timing for fall precipitation changes,", "and instead of getting a big storm that comes", "in northern Southern California and sort", "of shuts down the fire season,", "in terms of big severe fires,", "the fire season can extend weeks or months later", "into the fall", "and even the winter.", "And as that's happening,", "that probability of a big wind event is", "increasing the later you get in the year just because", "of the change in the seasons.", "And so we get these big wind driven events", "in the fall in addition to", "this more plume driven events like", "we were seeing this summer.", "And so all of these things are interacting on landscape", "in different places.", "And basically, you have these fuels that", "are much drier for much longer interacting with the timing", "of precipitation and winds in the fall.", "And producing, actually a fairly complex situation.", "It's not like one factor dominates.", "Yeah.", "And hey, we have a question. Yeah.", "We have one question.", "Bring it in.", "[laughs]", "One question from Michael.", "Mike Arent asks,", "What major economic and human migration shifts,", "do you see in the next 10 years", "due to global climate change?", "And feel free to apply that", "to the wildfire situation?", "It's in California, of course.", "Not globally,", "just specifically in California.", "Well wherever you wanna go with.", "Well, I think,", "for useful this focus on California,", "because that's our topic here.", "But it's not clear to me that people", "are going to abandon to the wild land urban interface", "or more rural areas of California just because of fire.", "It might be because of a combination of say", "insecure water supply and", "increase fire risks.", "It playing out in", "some rural communities, for example.", "But California is a big state got a housing crisis,", "a shortage of housing,", "it's expensive to live", "in the coastal cities.", "And then things like COVID are putting pressure on people", "to sort of spread out more instead of consolidated", "in already urbanized areas.", "So it's hard to tell,", "how that would play out.", "But if we're gonna stay in", "these rural communities,", "and in these smaller cities and towns that are", "in embedded and in fuels", "in risky places,", "like Paradise and Santa Rosa,", "have been in recent in the news", "in recent years,", "we need to learn how to manage", "that risk better.", "And that means that we need", "to quantify it, right?", "If you if you're gonna get homeowners insurance,", "it's going to cover your fire risk,", "then whoever's providing that insurance needs to be able", "to anticipate what the risk actually is.", "And if there are ways", "to mitigate it,", "what are the characteristics of homes", "and communities have spatial footprint and", "how we build them,", "how the vegetation around them is managed,", "that make them more or less robust", "to wildfire risks,", "that's something that we need", "to get a better handle on.", "And that's a forward looking thing.", "We can't concentrate on just what we've understood", "from looking at, say,", "the past five years,", "past 10 years past 20 years.", "It has to be science based projection into the future", "because the climate system that underlies all of the", "these fire risks and the ecosystem that supports fire,", "is shifting rapidly because of the legacy of--", "I'm sorry,", "we are out of time guys [laughs]", "I'm sorry to do that, [laughs]", "I'm sorry.", "We're out of time.", "Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
