We don\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she wrote to her subscribers. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting on a mask, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re into.\u201d She goes on to encourage her readers to treat themselves more gently, doing away with the idea that there\u2019s anything that needs fixing to begin with. \u201cMaybe try some color, some red lipstick, eye shadow...take a few pictures, and fall in love with yourself again.\u201d", "As \u201cFrench girl\u201d aesthetics go, there\u2019s the unassailable archetype\u2014impossibly cool and deliberately unattainable\u2014and then there\u2019s the 2020s update: earnestly celebrating whatever you\u2019ve got to work with. And that\u2019s where Violette, who goes by her first name only, has carved out a singular space. Today, she is expanding it with a multicategory vegan beauty brand, Violette_fr, that nods to her social-media success\u2014a community of 300,000 that has helped rack up more than 24 million views on her @Violette_fr YouTube channel\u2014and draws on 10 years of research and feedback from friends, models who have become friends, and, of course, followers.", "Within minutes of a Zoom call earlier this spring, it becomes clear why this particular French girl res\u00adonates with women in America\u2014not to mention this particular American living in Paris. Violette beams onto the screen with a wide smile, surrounded by enviably good light and dressed in a flowy white blouse and jeans. Her eyes\u2014lined in a deep blue pigment from her new collection\u2014are dusted by her signature Birkin bangs. She is excitedly telling me about her new office in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and after years of standoffish first encounters with other Frenchwomen, I find her warmth and approachability disarming. Also refreshing: when Violette admits that she\u2019s not ac\u00ad\u00adtually that into makeup. \u201cNo one should be dependent on a product to feel good. It should be an extension of our identities, like a wellness tool,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cWhat interests me is the ephemeral art you can create with makeup, not the trends.\u201d This kind of creative expression isn\u2019t about doing nothing, she insists, despite a pervasive \u201ceffortless beauty\u201d narrative that surrounds her and her work, which she acknowledges is a loaded concept. And it\u2019s not about losing yourself in a convoluted process, either. \u201cThe way you wear your makeup should make you feel something. But I don\u2019t like when it\u2019s trying too hard.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s a multihyphenate artist,\u201d says Glossier founder Emily Weiss. \u201cShe has a practical and playful approach to translating beauty into everyday life, which is often very hard for professionals to do\u201d", "As a fine-arts student at the prestigious \u00c9cole du Louvre in Paris, Violette stumbled into makeup, intrigued by the idea of using the face as a canvas. With no formal training and without assisting a more established artist\u2014the most tried-and-true road to success\u2014she decided to pursue a career in beauty. After a yearlong stint in New York at 19, knocking on the doors of modeling agencies and showing up to shoots with her own loose pigments, she moved back to Paris with a four-year goal: Make it work as a makeup artist on her own terms, or move on. Early jobs at French Vogue helped her build a reputation for custom-mixed colors and modern textures, earning her industry support and exposure. In 2012, at just 27 years old, she was named international makeup designer for Dior Beauty, the youngest in the brand\u2019s history. When Violette returned to New York three years later, similarly determined to make it work in the U.S., she launched her YouTube channel, which features a confessional and upbeat tone and covers everything from the impact of pregnancy on skin and hair (In\u00e8s, her daughter with her photographer husband, Steven, was born in 2019) to the mood-boosting power of a red lip.", "\u201cYouTube viewers are savvy, and they can tell immediately when a creator is faking it,\u201d Derek Blasberg, YouTube\u2019s head of fashion and beauty, explains of Violette\u2019s polished-to-a-point appeal. \u201cShe is the real deal, and that\u2019s why she has performed well on the platform.\u201d That, and the fact that she made it a priority to evolve her own channel into a network that showcases content from like-minded contributors, such as chef-activist Sophia Roe and British-Indian blogger Kavita Meera Mehta. \u201cShe\u2019s a multi\u00adhyphenate artist, really, not just a makeup artist,\u201d says Glossier founder Emily Weiss, who became fast friends with Violette after they met in Cannes in 2012, during Weiss\u2019s erstwhile days as a blogger. \u201cShe has a practical and playful approach to translating beauty and makeup into everyday life, which is often very hard for professionals to do.\u201d", "That\u2019s precisely why Est\u00e9e Lauder hired Violette to be its global beauty director in 2017\u2014and it\u2019s ultimately what she hopes to accomplish with her own brand, which spans makeup, skin care, fragrance, and hair, in practical formats with low-waste packaging. \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of trying to compete with Lauder?\u201d Violette asks, noting her deliberately tight curation. \u201cI wanted to create products people don\u2019t have.\u201d", "The result is what she calls \u201cstreet luxury\u201d\u2014top-shelf formulas at accessible prices. A unisex roll-on fragrance smells of musky vetiver, while an ingenious volumizing and oil-absorbing dry shampoo has a built-in brush applicator for on-the-go touch-ups. There\u2019s also a single, universal highlighter for all skin tones, six liquid eye paints in highly pigmented colors that are easily blended with fingertips, and the only red lip color you need\u2014a creamy blue-toned crimson designed to mimic the color and finish of rose petals in Paris\u2019s Bagatelle gardens. But the standout offering just might be the Boum Boum Milk, a three-in-one toner, serum, and moisturizer with an innovative creamy spray-on texture that Violette formulated with clean-beauty chemist Luc Jugla. \u201cIt\u2019s my hero product,\u201d she says, walking me through how easily the hydrating Icelandic glacial water\u2013 and\u2013fermented birch-sap emulsion mists onto the skin.", "It can even be scrunched into hair for a languid look\u2014that once-\u200bessential part of the romanticized Gallic construct that has, finally, started to break down. These days, what the Frenchwomen I see every day want is the freedom to embrace exactly who they are without ascribing to outdated, unrealistic expectations. They are drawn to brands and products that afford them the same opportunity\u2014and that are easily obtainable: In addition to being available in the U.S. on Violettefr.com, the products will also line the shelves at select Parisian pharmacies this spring, something that should excite local French girls (and tourists who aspire to shop like them). Adds Violette, \u201cMy dream is that everybody feels welcome here.\u201d", "Styling: @allisonbornstein6", "Hair: @drewmartinhair", "Videographer: @thestreetsensei"], "authors": ["Lindsey Tramuta", "Lindsey Tramut"], "keywords": ["theres", "violette", "debut", "makeup", "girl", "french", "democratizing", "thats", "skin", "line", "dont", "work", "artist", "beauty", "product"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
