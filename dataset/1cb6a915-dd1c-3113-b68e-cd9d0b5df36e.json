He read National Geographic accounts of deep-sea excursions and idolized Jacques Cousteau and his crew. \u201cThey always had this great French sense of style,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThey breathed it, quite literally, with their Aqua-Lungs. They got in their silver wetsuits and went exploring. It was like a science-fiction movie. I said, \u2018I need to do that.\u2019 \u201d The problem: he lived five hundred kilometres from the nearest ocean. He begged his father to find him a scuba course, and, one winter, he crossed into Buffalo to join a nighttime Y.M.C.A. class. \u201cIt was all adults, and I was this skinny sixteen-year-old,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was hard-core.\u201d", "Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Eventually, Cameron\u2019s aquanaut tendencies bled into his movie career. He filmed his 1989 underwater thriller, \u201cThe Abyss,\u201d in a seven-million-gallon containment vessel at an abandoned nuclear plant. In 1995, he made twelve dives to explore the wreckage of the Titanic, taking footage that appeared in his world-conquering hit film. In 2012, he became the first solo visitor to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the planet\u2019s lowest point, in the Mariana Trench. (After the multimillionaire explorer Victor Vescovo claimed to have gone deeper, two years ago, Cameron pushed back, saying the seabed there is flat.)", "His latest fascination: whales. As an explorer-at-large at National Geographic, Cameron executive-produced \u201cSecrets of the Whales,\u201d a docuseries premi\u00e8ring on Disney+ on Earth Day. \u201cWhales are very alien to us, but when you start studying them you realize how much we have in common,\u201d he said. He was joined, on Zoom, by his frequent collaborator Sigourney Weaver, who had supplied the show\u2019s voice-over. Neither physically entered the world of the whales; the series was shot by some twenty wildlife cinematographers, who spent three years getting up close to whales in twenty-four locations, including the Antarctic, Norway, and the Azores. But both had been whale-watching, and Weaver once had an encounter with thirty bottlenose dolphins, which swam up to her while she was snorkeling in Hawaii. \u201cI wrote to Jim afterward,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI remember what you said: \u2018The ocean gave you a gift.\u2019 \u201d", "Both found whales easy to relate to. Like Cameron, they\u2019re hitmakers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these male humpbacks off Western Australia that get together and cook up the song for the year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd other whales around the entire Southern Hemisphere sing that exact song. That\u2019s not just culture\u2014that\u2019s pop culture. That\u2019s the Beatles, right?\u201d One episode captures a whale in Patagonia teaching her granddaughter how to pull off a risky hunting move. \u201cI equated it to driving lessons for my son,\u201d Cameron continued. \u201cThey must be communicating with language on a high enough order that they can conceptualize the future: \u2018If this happens, do this.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cThe point is made, too, with the belugas and the humpbacks,\u201d Weaver said, describing another sequence. \u201cThe mother has this special cry to call the young one. As a mother, I thought, Wow, if we could have a sound that we could send out into the universe that would call back our child\u2014\u201d", "\u201c\u2014It\u2019s called a text,\u201d Cameron said. They recalled a mating scene, reminiscent of an Elvis concert, in which a male sperm whale swims into a group of females. \u201cThe male is ready, he is unsheathed, and he\u2019s ready to party,\u201d Weaver said, blushing. \u201cI just thought, My goodness!\u201d", "\u201cThe more you look into evolutionary biology,\u201d Cameron said, \u201cthe more you realize that the males are just these ridiculous creatures that grow giant antlers or big red snouts or whatever it is to impress the ladies, and it\u2019s the ladies who figure out who\u2019s going to get some.\u201d", "Weaver seemed pleased by this assessment. (She taped her voice-over in New York, where her assistant constructed a \u201ccave made out of clothes\u201d to muffle the construction noise outside.) The two first met in the mid-eighties, when Cameron was hired to write and direct \u201cAliens,\u201d another tale of interspecies encounters, and had to persuade Weaver to revive her butt-kicking character, Ripley. \u201cI was petrified\u2014plus, I\u2019d read that you were six feet tall,\u201d Cameron recalled. \u201cWhen we were all set to start shooting, you tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u2018Oh, by the way, I\u2019m an anti-gun lobbyist, and I can\u2019t fire a machine gun.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cRewrite, please!\u201d Weaver said, laughing.", "\u201cWe went out in the back lot and gave you a .45-calibre Thompson submachine gun, the old mobster kind, and you fired it,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI thought, All right, we\u2019re going to be O.K.\u201d More recently, the two spent eighteen months in L.A., shooting motion-capture scenes for \u201cAvatar 2.\u201d Before the pandemic hit, Cameron had been shooting in New Zealand, and he lobbied the government to let him continue his operations in Wellington, where he is now in postproduction. Weaver was calling from California, meaning that Cameron was twenty hours ahead. \u201cI\u2019m living in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to know what happens tomorrow, just ask me.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Michael Schulma"], "keywords": ["sigourney", "whales", "weaver", "james", "went", "end", "male", "shooting", "ocean", "whale", "deep", "recalled", "thought", "cameron"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
