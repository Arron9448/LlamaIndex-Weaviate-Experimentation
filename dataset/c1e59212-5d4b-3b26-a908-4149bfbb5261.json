It was the court\u2019s fifth order in favor of DP World since Djibouti nationalized the facility in January, 2018.", "\u201cThis ruling comes as no surprise,\u201d Djibouti\u2019s government said in a statement. \u201cIt is the outcome of the iniquitous provisions of the concession, which could force a state to set aside and disregard its own law, to revive a concession that was terminated on the grounds of the higher interest of the Djiboutian nation.\u201d", "The statement said Djibouti is open to discussing paying \u201cfair compensation\u201d but won\u2019t accept the court\u2019s order. Legal experts said the LCIA can\u2019t enforce any rulings if governments don\u2019t abide.", "\u201cWe encourage all parties to abide by the court\u2019s ruling,\u201d a DP World spokesman said. \u201cWe were never offered compensation and we don\u2019t want it. We want our concession back.\u201d", "The spokesman said the port operator has lost more than $1 billion in business since it was forced out of the Doraleh terminal.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "The case reflects Beijing\u2019s growing influence in developing African nations, which have been willing to lease state assets in return for Chinese state investments.", "Along with the concession that gave DP World the exclusive right to move containers in Djibouti, the Dubai-based operator owned 33% of the Doraleh terminal, with the government holding the rest.", "After nationalization, Djibouti offered a quarter of its stake to Chinese state behemoth China Merchants Ports Holdings, which is active across the world in port construction, container logistics and terminal management.", "China Merchants also built a separate container terminal in Djibouti as part of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, the multi-trillion dollar China is undertaking to build out global supply chains by running seaports in Europe, Asia and Africa.", "These gateways afford Chinese vessels priority handling and lower docking fees, giving China\u2019s carriers and their shipping customers an advantage in the contest to deliver as much cargo as possible in the shortest time to European markets.", "Djibouti stands at the entrance to the Red Sea and about 12% of all seaborne trade passes by there on giant vessels using the Suez Canal. There are no other ports along the coastline of East Africa with infrastructure to handle, store and trade cargo.", "Djibouti\u2019s location at the Horn of Africa also makes its ports strategically important for nations looking to exert influence across the region. The U.S. has a military installation in Djibouti for monitoring sea traffic tied to the Middle East. China also has a military base in Djibouti, its first in a foreign country.", "DP World has separately sued China Merchants for breach of exclusivity in moving containers in and out of Djibouti. The case will be heard at Hong Kong\u2019s High Court in March.", "China Merchants executives say their own terminal, which includes a China-backed $3.5 billion free trade zone, is legal under a separate deal with Djibouti.", "Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com"], "authors": ["Costas Paris"], "keywords": ["terminal", "hand", "state", "chinese", "concession", "dp", "merchants", "court", "trade", "rejects", "container", "world", "djibouti", "china", "ruling"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e"}
