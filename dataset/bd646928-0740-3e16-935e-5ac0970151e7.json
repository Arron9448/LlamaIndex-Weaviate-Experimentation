How would the way fashion is made, and the way that we all interact with it, change in the face of urgent calls for racial equity, an ongoing climate crisis, and the devastating effects of a global pandemic? We divided the answers into five chapters, which we will post over the coming days and which we have titled Creating Fashion, Sustainable Fashion, Buying Fashion, Responsible Fashion, and Viewing Fashion. Taken together, they reveal a wide-ranging portrait of our time while also pointing the way forward\u2014to a different fashion calendar, a different protocol for production, and an altogether different relationship with clothes. Here, 10 retailers weigh in on the future of Buying Fashion.", "Laverne Cox, Actress and Activist", "My relationship to fashion is so different now: I haven\u2019t done a red carpet in months, but I have this lovely collection of vintage Thierry Mugler jackets that I wear on my Zoom calls! I have a vintage Dior-bag collection, but they\u2019re just sort of sitting there on display in my closet; they\u2019re not going anywhere. What is the future of fashion if we\u2019re not leaving our homes? It\u2019s making me rethink my relationship to stuff\u2014 I still love beautiful things, and I think there will always be a place for that. But seeing that kind of beauty out in the world? I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll have that experience again.", "Linda Fargo, Senior Vice President of Fashion and Director of Store Presentation, Bergdorf Goodman", "Luxury today is dinner out with friends at a favorite old restaurant\u2014or simply visiting family in another city. Frankly, a hug is a luxury! It\u2019s a luxury because it\u2019s precious and hard to come by. For those who want to invest in daily luxuries, certain products still represent extraordinary creativity and impeccable quality\u2014they can inspire and reveal stories of incredible craftsmanship. It\u2019s hard to imagine a new future standing on the shoulders of today which doesn\u2019t hold love, time, quality, people, action, and experience as high-value assets. That\u2019s not to say that rarified items won\u2019t be sought after\u2014but they won\u2019t define luxury, either.", "Ikram Goldman, Retailer, Ikram", "What we do as a [fashion] industry is create beauty and magic. We tell a story that people want to be a part of\u2014and now we\u2019re telling that story again and again, but it doesn\u2019t sound fantastic anymore. It sounds like a broken record. We\u2019re pushing things on them that they don\u2019t necessarily need. Our women want more quality, less quantity\u2014they would much rather invest in an important piece that they know they can wear. They never want to look at a pair of sweatpants again\u2014it will remind them of a very hard time in America; of Trump and the coronavirus; of being stuck at home. But they still want to feel comfortable\u2014and look beautiful. People are going to invest in jewelry because they\u2019re going to be seen in a way that they normally would not have been seen\u2014especially if you\u2019re on Zoom calls. You\u2019re going to see a lot of women taking better care of their skin and their faces and wearing makeup a lot more. You\u2019re going to see a lot of really beautiful jackets and tops and accessories and necklaces. There\u2019s also going to be a lot of people entertaining at home and dressing spectacularly for that\u2014this is their one shot to experience that feeling that they\u2019ve longed for. We have a lot of clients who are saying, I\u2019m having a dinner party, six people, and I need a new dress. And they\u2019ll buy a beautiful lace dress\u2014but the shoe will be lower. The shift is going to be to incredibly luxurious items that aren\u2019t ostentatious. People have to think fun.", "Natalie Kingham, Buying Director, MatchesFashion.com", "I have had to think very hard and very quickly about what we need from designers, and there are three things I\u2019ve identified. First: Redefine luxury\u2014from the artisanal bag to jewelry, let\u2019s look at the scalability and the responsibility. Designers are really thinking about who is making it, how it\u2019s being made, and that conversation is accelerating. People will want to spend their money on items that have an aspect of giving back. Second: Let\u2019s support Black and BIPOC brands and look at them even more closely. Third: [Designers] can\u2019t be all things to all people. Let\u2019s ask, What are you amazing at?", "Our customers\u2019 lifestyles are shifting: They\u2019re entertaining at home a lot more, traveling less, walking, and on our bikes more. Fashion has to enhance your life, make you feel good: We all know the power of feeling good. And [fashion] follows life: Heel heights will come down, hemlines will come down. You might want to put on a fabulous frock, but it can\u2019t be too restricting; you\u2019ll want to be able to kick off your shoes with it. There will be more working out at home. The T-shirt, the hoodie\u2014they will be incredibly relevant."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "As Told To", "Jason Duzansk", "Rinaldi Parunga"], "keywords": ["things", "look", "theyre", "different", "bergdorfs", "future", "hard", "farfetch", "lot", "buying", "going", "retailers", "way", "fashion"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
