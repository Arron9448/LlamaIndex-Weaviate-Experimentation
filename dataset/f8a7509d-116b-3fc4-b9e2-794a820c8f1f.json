{"pubDate": null, "title": "How Far Will California Take Criminal-Justice Reform?", "paragraphs": ["\u201cALL HANDS ON DECK,\u201d the writer and activist Shaun King wrote on Twitter on Friday afternoon, calling on San Franciscans to protest the decision of London Breed, the city\u2019s mayor, to name Suzy Loftus as the interim district attorney. Loftus\u2019s appointment comes in the final weeks of a heated race in which she is a contender; the election was to be the first open race in more than a century. But, on Thursday, the city\u2019s outgoing D.A., George Gascon, stepped down from the position early, allowing Breed to appoint Loftus, whom she had endorsed. Loftus, who is a former police commissioner, was a loyal acolyte of Kamala Harris when she was San Francisco\u2019s D.A. and the state\u2019s attorney general, and she is backed by heavy Northern California political figures, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Diane Feinstein. Loftus was already an establishment figure, and will now be an incumbent.", "The move sharpens the dynamics in an election that, in imitation of Presidential primary politics, already hinged upon the question of just how much the electorate desires disruption\u2014are we more fed up or more afraid? King\u2019s candidate, and arguably Loftus\u2019s most dangerous competitor, is Chesa Boudin, a thirty-nine-year-old Rhodes Scholar and a graduate of Yale Law School, who is currently a public defender in San Francisco and a leader in the movement to abolish money bail. The San Francisco Chronicle, endorsing Loftus, wrote that Boudin at times \u201cseemed as if he should be running for public defender instead of district attorney.\u201d Responding to Loftus\u2019s appointment, Boudin told me that voters would see through, and be repelled by, the political gambit. \u201cI\u2019m confident that our campaign will overcome this last-minute effort to preserve a failed status quo,\u201d he said.", "San Francisco is a city whose electorate skews and is easily skewered as radical-fringe left, but where law-enforcement practices nonetheless follow the same disturbing pattern of brutality seen in the rest of the state. Boudin\u2019s candidacy, which calls for to-the-studs reform, evokes Larry Krasner, the former civil-rights attorney who is now the D.A. of Philadelphia, and Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a young public defender in Queens, endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ran for D.A. of the borough this year. In San Francisco, even moderates run as progressives, but Boudin has a particular moral authority that lies in his own story.", "Like the majority of Americans, Boudin has had a family member incarcerated. In the fall of 1981, when he was a toddler, his parents, radical activists affiliated with the Weather Underground, took part in an armed heist orchestrated by the black-power organization the Black Liberation Army, in Rockland County, New York. The target was a Brink\u2019s armored truck making a pickup at a mall. In the process of stealing $1.6 million, the gunmen killed a Brink\u2019s guard, then drove to meet a U-Haul van that was to serve as a getaway vehicle. Boudin\u2019s father, David Gilbert, was behind the wheel of the U-Haul, and his mother, Kathy, was in the passenger seat. When police stopped the van, their conspirators opened the back doors and fired on the officers, killing two of them. After twenty-two years in prison, Kathy was released on parole from Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a couple of weeks before Chesa left for Oxford on the Rhodes Scholarship. (Elizabeth Kolbert profiled Kathy Boudin for this magazine, in 2001.) Gilbert is still in maximum-security prison, held under a New York law that makes anyone involved in a felony in the course of which murder is committed punishable for murder himself. (A similar law in California was downgraded last year.)", "Boudin\u2019s mother, Kathy, served twenty-two years in prison after taking part in an armed heist orchestrated by the Black Liberation Army in 1981.

By his own description, he was a troubled, angry kid who had the privilege of psychiatrists, private school, wealthy grandparents, a patient, supportive social environment, and also whiteness. Visiting his mother at Bedford Hills, he met another boy, Lorenzo, who was originally from Guyana and whose mother was also imprisoned there. Unlike Boudin, Lorenzo was calm and studious, and, when Boudin acted up, Lorenzo talked him down. Kathy, Boudin remembers, counselled him to be more like Lorenzo. A decade later, Lorenzo re\u00ebntered his life, now a prisoner on his father\u2019s cell block\u2014condemned, as Boudin sees it, by his status as a black man and an immigrant. (He was later deported to Guyana.)", "Boudin came to know his father through a family-visiting program, which allowed him to stay overnight in designated trailers on the prison grounds. He learned to cook in a kitchen where the only knife was chained to the sink. When he was ten, and the prison was considering cancelling trailer overnights, Boudin wrote a letter to the warden, which helped to save the program\u2014his first successful gesture as a prison activist. As an undergraduate at Yale, he wrote a term paper, \u201cFrom Jail to Yale,\u201d about the children of the incarcerated. Boudin\u2019s father won\u2019t be eligible for parole until 2056. \u201cI used to speak to him through Plexiglas,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou learn that the system is broken.\u201d", "Boudin leads his opponents in fund-raising, having brought in five hundred and five thousand dollars this year, and has secured a number of high-profile Twitterverse endorsements, including, this week, from John Legend. Over the summer, Boudin held a fund-raiser in Silver Lake, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. The house, at the top of a hill, overlooked downtown. Somewhere among the glitter of city lights was Men\u2019s Central Jail, where some forty-four hundred men, most of whom are awaiting trial, are locked up each day. Boudin, who is slim, with a tracery of facial hair and a hyper-focussed social manner, walked around the deck, greeting old friends (Dohrn\u2019s former law student! A friend he met on a Fulbright in Venezuela! The guy he used to stay up all night with at Model U.N.!), neglecting the plate of food in his hand. When the talking part of the evening was set to begin, Patrisse Cullors, a founder of Black Lives Matter, stood up, her back to the lights, and introduced Boudin. She said that she wished she lived in San Francisco so that she could vote for him. \u201cWe live in the Resistance State\u2014supposedly,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, if we live in the Resistance State, we need to be electing people who are resisting. It\u2019s not just about Forty-five\u201d\u2014Donald Trump, the forty-fifth President. \u201cForty-five didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. We need to be electing people who are rejecting white supremacy as a whole. People who are willing to challenge an incarceration system that has literally brought in millions and millions of people.\u201d", "A focus of Boudin\u2019s work as a public defender and a plank of his campaign is the abolition of money bail. \u201cEighty per cent of San Francisco\u2019s jail population are waiting for trial, and the bail schedule in San Francisco is nearly five times the national average,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for people to be detained without bail or with conditions that would make it safe, such as no alcohol\u2014narrowly tailored conditions that meet the circumstances\u2014rather than an arbitrary price tag.\u201d One of Boudin\u2019s clients, Kenneth Humphrey, was held on a bail of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, for allegedly threatening an elderly neighbor and stealing a five-dollar bottle of cologne. Boudin sued, and California\u2019s First District Court of Appeals, in a significant decision, agreed that Humphrey\u2019s bail was a violation of due process and equal protection; he was released on the condition that he wear an ankle monitor and participate in a drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation program. The case will likely be heard by the State Supreme Court in the next year.", "In Silver Lake, Boudin said that his parents\u2019 imprisonment had given him insight into the system, and informed the work he wants to do as D.A. \u201cI saw a racist system of mass incarceration,\u201d he told the room. \u201cInstead of equal justice, we have money bail. Instead of meaningful treatment for mental illness, we have solitary confinement. Seventy-three per cent of the people booked into S.F. county jail are mentally ill, drug-addicted, or both. Eighty per cent haven\u2019t been convicted\u2014they\u2019re waiting. We put a price tag on that, knowing that most of them don\u2019t have the money to purchase their freedom, and, while they\u2019re waiting, they\u2019ll lose their job, their custody of their kids, their housing.\u201d", "Cullors, of Black Lives Matter, asked him what his mom and dad thought about his choice to run. \u201cThey\u2019re scared that their histories, choices, and mistakes will be used to attack me,\u201d Boudin said. \u201cI had my hardest conversation in my dad\u2019s prison visiting room. He said, \u2018We have enough people in prison. You know if you win, you\u2019re going to be sending people to prison.\u2019 I genuinely believe that prison should be the last resort.\u201d", "Meanwhile, Gascon, the departed D.A.\u2014widely admired by progressives as a champion of Proposition 47, which converted certain crimes, including personal drug use, from felonies to misdemeanors\u2014announced that he was heading for Los Angeles, to position himself for a run against the city\u2019s D.A., Jackie Lacey, in 2020. Under Lacey, the first black woman to serve as a D.A. in Los Angeles, twenty-two convicts have been condemned to death, all of them people of color. Los Angeles County is the largest jailer in the country. A Gascon candidacy would test how serious the country is about changing its approach to crime and punishment."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/california-chronicles/how-far-will-california-take-criminal-justice-reform", "keywords": ["reform", "far", "prison", "da", "criminaljustice", "black", "kathy", "loftus", "san", "lorenzo", "bail", "boudin", "francisco", "california"], "summary": "In San Francisco, even moderates run as progressives, but Boudin has a particular moral authority that lies in his own story.\nAfter twenty-two years in prison, Kathy was released on parole from Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a couple of weeks before Chesa left for Oxford on the Rhodes Scholarship.\n(Elizabeth Kolbert profiled Kathy Boudin for this magazine, in 2001.)\nUnlike Boudin, Lorenzo was calm and studious, and, when Boudin acted up, Lorenzo talked him down.\nShe said that she wished she lived in San Francisco so that she could vote for him.", "authors": ["Dana Goodyear", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jeffrey Toobin", "The New Yorker"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "f8a7509d-116b-3fc4-b9e2-794a820c8f1f"}
