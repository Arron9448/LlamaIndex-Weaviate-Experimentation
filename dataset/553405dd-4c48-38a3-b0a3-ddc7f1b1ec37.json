A look back over the coverage of the story\u2014a repeatedly discredited conspiracy theory involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine\u2014suggests that America\u2019s news organizations continue to be just as susceptible to manipulation by political partisans pushing complicated and hard-to-check foreign narratives as they were in 2016. In fact, several of the same players are involved. \u201cThere\u2019s no effective mechanism in this country for weeding disinformation out,\u201d Paul Barrett, the deputy director of N.Y.U.\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, and the author of the recent study \u201cDisinformation and the 2020 Election,\u201d said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything about it at all.\u201d", "Anyone trying to track the Ukrainian conspiracy stories that were eventually embraced by President Trump is likely to get mired in the same echo chamber of right-wing news purveyors that misinformed voters in 2016. A pivotal source of the allegations against the Bidens, for instance, is the Government Accountability Institute, a Florida-based opposition-research operation that was founded by the former Trump political adviser Stephen Bannon\u2014the same conservative nonprofit that ginned up questionable stories about the Clintons during the last Presidential campaign. In both instances, much of the coverage of the scandal was kicked off by Peter Schweizer, a longtime conservative political writer who is an editor-at-large at Breitbart News and the president of the Government Accountability Institute. Since its founding, in 2012, the group has largely been funded with millions of dollars in tax-exempt donations from the family foundation of the New York hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who was a major donor to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. In the organization\u2019s most recently available I.R.S. tax filings, for 2017, Mercer\u2019s daughter Rebekah is listed as the board chairman.", "Asked about the Government Accountability Institute\u2019s role in this year\u2019s Biden scandal coverage, Bannon e-mailed to say, \u201cIt\u2019s key. It was the predicate,\u201d as it had been for much of the previous Clinton scandal coverage. As Joshua Green describes in \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d his book, from 2017, about Bannon\u2019s role in the Trump campaign, Bannon designed the organization as a means of transmitting partisan dirt-digging to the mainstream media. He realized that, though mainstream reporters were suspicious of partisan opinion, they were open to damning facts about public figures, regardless of the sourcing. He set out, with Schweizer, to produce material that would generate mainstream coverage, and right-wing outrage.", "Thus, during the last Presidential campaign, under the auspices of the Government Accountability Institute, Schweizer published the best-selling book \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d In a novel arrangement, he doled out negative scoops about the Clintons from it in advance to a variety of mainstream news outlets, including the Times. The paper disclosed its exclusive deal with the book\u2019s author to its readers, and maintained that it independently verified and expanded on the information. But when it ran a front-page story derived from the book on April 24, 2015, the Times stirred controversy and criticism, including from its own public editor.", "The story insinuated that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton had risked national security by facilitating the sale of American uranium mines to Russia in exchange for more than two million dollars in contributions to the Clinton Foundation from the businessmen behind the deal, who worked for a company called Uranium One. The story enabled Clinton\u2019s opponents to frame her as greedy and corrupt. Even a year after she had lost the race, the Fox News host Sean Hannity was still invoking it on air, calling it \u201cthe biggest scandal ever involving Russia.\u201d", "Yet later reporting poked holes in the story\u2019s insinuation of corruption, revealing that multiple government agencies\u2014not just Clinton\u2019s State Department\u2014had approved the deal, and that the amount of uranium involved was negligible. (Schweizer didn\u2019t respond to phone calls from The New Yorker.) On Thursday, the Daily Beast identified what it said were over a dozen passages in his book, \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u201d that were lifted from other sources, such as Wikipedia\u2014a charge that his publisher, HarperCollins, denied amounted to a violation of fair use.", "For those who recall the \u201cClinton Cash\u201d controversy, the baseless tales claiming that Biden corruptly intervened on behalf of his son\u2019s Ukrainian business interests feel a lot like the movie \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d In March of 2018, Schweizer and the Government Accountability Institute once again produced a book that was perfectly timed for the Presidential campaign. \u201cSecret Empires\u201d devoted a chapter to the subject of \u201cBidens in Ukraine,\u201d which laid out the conflicts of interest posed by the wheeling and dealing of Biden\u2019s son Hunter. (An additional chapter laid out Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in China.) As the book recounted, in 2014, Hunter Biden, a Washington lobbyist, took a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch, while his father, who was then the Vice-President, handled a drive to rid Ukraine of corruption. Other news organizations, including the Times and the Wall Street Journal, had already run stories on the same unethical-seeming morass. (In July, The New Yorker published a piece about the relationship between Joe and Hunter Biden that dismissed allegations of any illegality in the Ukraine matter but included some concerns from Obama Administration officials that Hunter could potentially undermine his father\u2019s work.)", "But Schweizer went a step further. His chapter implied not just that Burisma was a crooked company but that the end of a Ukrainian criminal investigation into it on January 12, 2017, was in some unstated way connected to Joe Biden\u2019s visit to the country four days later. In this way, Schweizer floated the possibility that, as Vice-President, Biden had abused his power to protect the company or his son from prosecution. Yet Schweizer provided no proof of causation nor evidence of illegality.", "As he rolled out his new book, Schweizer promoted it in all the usual conservative news outlets, including \u201cHannity\u201d and \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum,\u201d on Fox News. But the turning point in the Biden coverage, it appears, was in late 2018, when Trump\u2019s private lawyer and political advocate, the former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, got involved. That winter, Giuliani began speaking to current and former Ukrainian officials about the Biden conspiracy theory, and meeting with them repeatedly in New York and Europe. Among those officials was Viktor Shokin, a former top Ukrainian prosecutor who was sacked in March, 2016, after European and U.S. officials, including Joe Biden, complained that he was lax in curbing corruption. Shokin claimed that he had lost his powerful post not because of his poor performance but rather because Biden wanted to stop his investigation of Burisma, in order to protect his son. The facts didn\u2019t back this up. The Burisma investigation had been dormant under Shokin. But in March, according to NBC News, Giuliani gave the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, a packet of Trump Hotel folders containing the purported evidence against Biden, including Giuliani\u2019s interview with Shokin and his strategy to spread the Biden story, \u201cincluding segments being placed on Fox News.\u201d Before long, this explosive, politically useful legend took on a life of its own in America\u2019s conservative media.", "As an anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint to Congress revealed, and as the Washington Post has reported, no journalist played a bigger part in fuelling the Biden corruption narrative than John Solomon, who until last week was an opinion columnist and executive vice-president of The Hill, in Washington. Solomon had been a respected investigative reporter for the Washington Post, but in recent years he worked for overtly conservative outlets, including a stint as the editor of the Washington Times. As Giuliani conspired this past spring with questionable Ukrainian sources, Solomon pumped out a string of eye-catching stories echoing those sources\u2019 claims about the Bidens. This appears to have been no coincidence. According to NBC, the Giuliani documents show that Solomon\u2019s columns were part of the Trump team\u2019s strategy. (The New Yorker was unable to reach John Solomon, and a question e-mailed to the editor of The Hill, about whether the publication stood by Solomon\u2019s stories, went unanswered.)", "This spring, Solomon wrote a series of columns, based on an interview with Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko. On March 26th, Solomon wrote a column about Lutsenko\u2019s claim that the then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, an Obama holdover named Marie Yovanovitch, had given him a list of politically protected figures that he was forbidden from prosecuting\u2014a charge the State Department dismissed as \u201can outright fabrication.\u201d That same day, Solomon wrote another column suggesting a new investigation into Clinton, which he shared in a tweet, writing, \u201cDid Ukraine try to secretly help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election? Chief prosecutor says there\u2019s enough evidence to start investigating.\u201d", "On April 1st, Solomon turned his focus to Biden, writing a column for The Hill called \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s 2020 Ukrainian Nightmare,\u201d which claimed that Ukraine was reopening its criminal probe into Burisma. It also repeated the unsubstantiated claim that Shokin\u2019s investigation into the company had been cut short at the behest of Biden.", "In Solomon\u2019s April 1st column, he cited Schweizer\u2019s book. Two days later, Schweizer sent \u201ckudos\u201d to Solomon during an interview on Breitbart News, and added, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about potentially legal jeopardy involving the Vice-President\u2019s family.\u201d Schweizer opined that it was \u201call the sort of thing that needs to be investigated and looked into by a grand jury,\u201d and added, \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear that you have a pattern that the for-sale sign was open with the Biden family . . . and that in itself demands investigation in the United States.\u201d", "Soon, both Schweizer and Solomon were appearing repeatedly on Fox News, spreading the anti-Biden narrative further. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, during the month of April, Fox ran at least twelve segments about Solomon\u2019s reporting on Biden. After one of seven episodes in which Sean Hannity discussed it on his show, President Trump tweeted a reference to Solomon\u2019s reporting. His son Donald Trump, Jr., took up the narrative, too, and tweeted a link to a story in the Daily Wire, a conservative outlet, which echoed Solomon\u2019s claims.", "On April 7th, Giuliani appeared on Fox and demanded that the Justice Department investigate the Democrats\u2019 Ukraine dealings. On April 25th, the same day that Joe Biden officially declared that he was running for President, Trump himself called in to Hannity\u2019s show on Fox, saying that he wanted the Attorney General, Bill Barr, to be involved. By raising the spectre of a criminal investigation, Trump, a President dogged by allegations of corruption had, with the help of the conservative echo chamber, managed to cast his chief political rival in a parallel story, leaving the public in a fog of suspicion and confusion. As Barrett, of N.Y.U., explained it, \u201cThe consequence is that we begin to inch our way towards the mire that Russians are in where ordinary people lose their ability to tell truth from untruth, and even cease caring about it.\u201d", "By May, the mainstream media, including the Times, had picked up on the story about Biden and Ukraine. Although the Times\u2019 piece ran under a headline pointing out that that the scandal was being \u201cpromoted by Trump and Allies,\u201d and, midway, noted that there was no evidence of criminality, critics attacked the paper for reprising the Uranium One playbook. \u201cIt\u2019s precisely what we saw in the last election,\u201d Yochai Benkler, a professor at Harvard Law School and the co-author of the recent book \u201cNetwork Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics,\u201d told me. Benkler argues that when a publication with the Times\u2019 credibility pays any attention to a fringe conspiracy theory, it \u201cprovides enormous validation\u201d just by covering the story. \u201cI don\u2019t fault the Times for doing a story,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like the nineteen-sixties anymore, when there were just three TV networks. You live in a country where a large part of the population is susceptible to propaganda. There\u2019s a new editorial responsibility to be much more careful and not bury the denial.\u201d", "By mid-summer, the Times and other mainstream outlets, most notably Bloomberg News, had more or less knocked down the conspiracy theories. By then, Trump was so invested in the counterfactual narrative that he was demanding that Ukraine\u2019s new President provide confirmation of it, as the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint relates. Or, as documents released by Congress earlier this week revealing discussions between his emissaries to Ukraine put it, \u201cPotus really wants the deliverable.\u201d With Trump facing the prospect of impeachment in the House of Representatives, it appears that he is a casualty of his side\u2019s own disinformation. \u201cWhether Trump and Giuliani are dupes of their own propaganda I can\u2019t say. But the timeline is completely consistent with that,\u201d Benkler said. \u201cEither way, it proves that running an Administration based on Hannity is dangerous.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "553405dd-4c48-38a3-b0a3-ddc7f1b1ec37", "keywords": ["schweizer", "conspiracy", "ukraine", "biden", "times", "including", "trump", "ukrainian", "conservative", "solomon", "book", "invention", "theory"], "title": "The Invention of the Conspiracy Theory on Biden and Ukraine", "summary": "Asked about the Government Accountability Institute\u2019s role in this year\u2019s Biden scandal coverage, Bannon e-mailed to say, \u201cIt\u2019s key.\nOther news organizations, including the Times and the Wall Street Journal, had already run stories on the same unethical-seeming morass.\nThat winter, Giuliani began speaking to current and former Ukrainian officials about the Biden conspiracy theory, and meeting with them repeatedly in New York and Europe.\nIt also repeated the unsubstantiated claim that Shokin\u2019s investigation into the company had been cut short at the behest of Biden.\nBenkler argues that when a publication with the Times\u2019 credibility pays any attention to a fringe conspiracy theory, it \u201cprovides enormous validation\u201d just by covering the story.", "authors": ["Jane Mayer", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jelani Cobb", "David Rohde", "Susan B.
