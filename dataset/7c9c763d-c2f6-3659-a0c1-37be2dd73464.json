The Chinese government is committing ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and the world should not stay silent. United Nations experts have described the region as a \u201cno-rights zone\u201d where Uighurs are \u201ctreated as enemies of the state based on nothing more than their ethno-religious identity\u201d. Recently, leaked government documents added to the body of evidence about the vast system of internment camps, which are holding more than a million Uighurs and Turkic Muslims. It is the largest detention of an ethno-religious minority since the second world war.", "\u00d6zil\u2019s post prompted anger from Chinese state-controlled media and social media platforms. The Chinese Football Association issued a statement that the Arsenal star \u201churt the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d but censored the content of the post, so readers didn\u2019t know why their feelings had been hurt.

Following in the footsteps of many brands that adopted the Chinese Communist party (CCP) political stance, the club released a Chinese-language statement that \u201cThe content published is \u00d6zil\u2019s personal opinion. As a football club, Arsenal has always adhered to the principle of not involving itself in politics.\u201d The statement still does not appear on its English-language social media accounts or website.", "As many NBA fans found out in October, when the Houston Rockets manager sparked a major crisis for briefly supporting the Hong Kong protestors, sports clubs are not prepared to stand up to the Chinese government for fear that it will shut down a significant source of revenue.", "Though global football institutions stayed silent when Uighur footballer Erfan Hezim was sent to an internment camp, they should not look away now that one of the sport\u2019s most prominent players has forced the issue.
