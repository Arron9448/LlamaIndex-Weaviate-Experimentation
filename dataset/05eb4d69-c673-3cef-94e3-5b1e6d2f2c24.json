My mother, like so many mothers, owned a sewing machine and knew how to use it. How had this come to be? I asked her recently. She gave a verbal shrug, over the phone from Houston, where she lives now. \u201cIf you read the directions and followed the pattern, it would come out all right,\u201d she recalled. She didn\u2019t even remember, perhaps because they were as ordinary to her as grocery shopping, our trips to the fabric store.", "Oh, the fabric store. Even now, decades later, when I google those words and look at the photos, my heart thumps with desire. To be clear, these are not photos of fabric for sale online, but photos of the interiors of actual physical places where one goes to touch bolts of fabric and cards of rickrack, buttons buttoned to a stiff cardboard backing or tumbling loose in a jar. Dispenser displays of thread arranged by color, the spools\u2019 curved surfaces gleaming like candy, and every kind of beautiful ribbon, in every color and texture and pattern. The fabric store, unlike the grocery store, made me hungry, though for what, exactly, wasn\u2019t clear at the time. It was something much larger and much less defined than the outfits my mother would make from the items we chose, the fabrics and notions and trim. But the outfits I loved with my whole heart and remember as clearly as if they still hung in my closet: the ruffled pinafore made from a white-on-white print of tiny flowers trimmed with red rickrack and finished with an appliqu\u00e9 of juicy strawberries on the bib; the shirtdress of a multicolor cotton printed with a pattern to resemble embroidery; the truly glamorous halter dress with a triple-tiered skirt of pastel blue, pastel pink, pastel yellow. \u201cWow,\u201d says my mother, now in her 80s, on the other end of the phone, as I lovingly describe her creations. She\u2019s impressed I remember so well. She has zero memory of sewing me any of these things, though she does remember making herself a dress with extremely big sleeves\u2014\u201cThey were in style that year.\u201d She says she wore it a few times and decided the sleeves looked so stupid that she tore them off and wore the dress sleeveless.", "The fact that unlike me, my mother is white\u2014exceedingly pale, small-boned, blue-eyed, and with the cheekbones of a film star\u2014both oppressed me throughout my childhood and lay somehow outside of thought. Even to articulate it now feels uncomfortable. But the facts were, and remain, that my pale, blue-eyed mother never matched my black-haired, brown-eyed, dark-skinned self\u2014always far darker as a child than I ever get now, because I was outside all summer in an era before sunscreen. In elementary school in Indiana, I was cast as the lone Native American in the Thanksgiving play. More generally, I was constantly looked at, especially\u2014or, at least, so it seemed to me\u2014when standing next to my mother. We didn\u2019t match. I harbored a fantasy, half fearful, half escapist, that I would turn out to have been adopted from some faraway land. Even my father\u2014who really was from a \u201cfaraway land\u201d\u2014only explained my appearance, without removing my anomalousness. He was too anomalous himself."], "authors": ["Susan Choi", "Susan Cho"], "keywords": ["childhood", "photos", "mother", "pattern", "pastel", "fabric", "remember", "store", "dress", "secret", "self", "patterns", "sewing", "wore"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
