The tabloids, he explained, created a \u201ctoxic environment\u201d of fear and control. His father, the Prince of Wales, \u201chad made peace with it.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t, and that\u2019s one of the major reasons the couple chose to quit royal life. Earlier in Winfrey\u2019s two-hour interview, she had flashed several tabloid headlines across the screen. \u201cHarry\u2019s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton,\u201d read one. \u201cHarry to marry into gangster royalty?\u201d read another.", "It\u2019s not the first time the prince has made such a condemnation\u2014in November 2016, after news broke that he was dating Markle, Kensington Palace released a statement criticizing \u201cthe racial undertones of comment pieces\u201d in the press\u2014but it was perhaps the boldest. Soon after, the U.K.\u2019s Society of Editors released a controversial statement saying that the country\u2019s press was \u201cnot bigoted.\u201d", "\u201cIf it is simply the case the Sussexes feel that the press by questioning their actions and commenting on their roles when working as Royals funded by the taxpayer were being racist then they are mistaken,\u201d said Ian Murray, its executive.", "More than 160 journalists of color formally objected to the statement. (\u201cThe blanket refusal to accept there is any bigotry in the British press is laughable, does a disservice to journalists of colour, and shows an institution and an industry in denial,\u201d they wrote in an open letter.) Murray, in turn, stepped down from his leadership position. But the implication was clear: that a certain cohort of reporters and editors didn\u2019t believe there was any bias.", "Omid Scobie is part of the press pack that regularly covered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The ABC News contributor and author of Finding Freedom takes a firm stance against the intersectional intolerance of the coverage surrounding the couple: \u201cIt\u2019s not just racism at play here\u2014there\u2019s also sheer ignorance, xenophobia, misogyny, and a kind of anti-Americanism that exists,\u201d he tells Vogue."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["change", "markle", "prince", "tabloids", "oprah", "press", "harry", "tabloid", "meghan", "read", "culture", "racist", "murray", "statement", "released"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
