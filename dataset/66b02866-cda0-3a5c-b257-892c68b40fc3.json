{"pubDate": null, "title": "Living Well Is the Best Revenge", "paragraphs": ["A writer like F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose life can almost be said to have attracted more attention than his work, may have to wait a long time before his literary reputation finds its true level. Although \u201cTender Is the Night,\u201d the novel Fitzgerald liked best of the four he published during his lifetime, was generally considered a failure when it first appeared (even by Fitzgerald, who tried to improve its standing by writing a revised version that nearly everybody agreed was much worse), it has been quietly assuming, over the years, something like the status of an American classic. Sales in the past twelve months exceeded five hundred and fifty thousand copies, or about forty-five times the sale of the original edition. The book, which was out of print when Fitzgerald died, in 1940, is now available in four editions, and is required reading in a large number of college courses in American literature. If many critics still regard it as a failure, they now tend to see it as a noble failure, a flawed masterpiece, and if they still complain that the disintegration of Dick Diver, its psychiatrist hero, is never satisfactorily resolved, most of them concede that Diver is one of those rare heroes in American fiction about whom the reader really cares, and that the account of his disintegration, ambiguous though it may be, is so harrowing that it makes the glittering perfection of plot in a novel like \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d seem almost too neat. The real trouble with the book, as every college English major knows, is that Fitzgerald started out by using a friend of his named Gerald Murphy as the model for Dick Diver, and then allowed Diver to change, midway through the narrative, into F. Scott Fitzgerald. To a lesser degree, he did the same thing with his heroine, Nicole Diver, who has some of the physical characteristics and mannerisms of Sara Murphy, Gerald\u2019s wife, but is in all other respects Zelda Fitzgerald. The double metamorphosis was readily apparent at the time to friends of the Fitzgeralds and the Murphys. Ernest Hemingway wrote Fitzgerald a cutting letter about the book, accusing him of cheating with his material; by starting with the Murphys and then changing them into different people, Hemingway contended, Fitzgerald had produced not people at all but beautifully faked case histories. Gerald Murphy raised the same point when he read the novel, which was dedicated \u201cTo Gerald and Sara\u2014Many F\u00eates,\u201d and Fitzgerald\u2019s reply, Murphy recalled the other day, almost floored him. \u201cThe book,\u201d Fitzgerald said, \u201cwas inspired by Sara and you, and the way I feel about you both and the way you live, and the last part of it is Zelda and me because you and Sara are the same people as Zelda and me.\u201d This astonishing statement served to confirm a long-held conviction of Sara Murphy\u2019s that Fitzgerald knew very little about people, and nothing at all about the Murphy\u2019s. Now in their seventies, the Murphys today are not inclined to think very much about the past. The book was published in 1934, and Gerald spent the next twenty-two years in his father\u2019s old position as president of Mark Cross, the New York leather-goods store\u2014a position he took out of necessity and from which he retired, with great relief, in 1956. Last summer, he and Sara both reread \u201cTender Is the Night\u201d for the first time since it was published, and with varying reactions. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the book when I read it, and I liked it even less on rereading,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI reject categorically any resemblance to us or to anyone we knew at any time.\u201d Gerald, on the other hand, was fascinated to discover (he had not noticed it the first time) how Fitzgerald had used \u201ceverything he noted or was told about by me\u201d during the years that the two couples spent together in Paris and on the Riviera\u2014the years from 1924 to 1929. Almost every incident, he became aware, almost every conversation in the opening section of the book had some basis in an actual event or conversation involving the Murphys, although it was often altered or distorted in detail. \u201cWhen I like men,\u201d Fitzgerald once wrote, \u201cI want to be like them\u2014I want to lose the outer qualities that give me my individuality and be like them.\u201d Fitzgerald wanted to be like Gerald Murphy because he admired Murphy as much as any man he had ever met, and because he was thoroughly fascinated, and sometimes thoroughly baffled, by the life the Murphys had created for themselves and their friends. It was a life of great originality, and considerable beauty, and some of its special quality comes through in the first hundred pages of \u201cTender Is the Night.\u201d In the eyes of the young actress, Rosemary Hoyt, the Divers represented \u201cthe exact furthermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them.\u201d Dick Diver\u2019s \u201cextraordinary virtuosity with people,\u201d his \u201cexquisite consideration,\u201d his \u201cpoliteness that moved so fast and intuitively, that it could be examined only in its effect\u201d all were, and still are, qualities of Gerald Murphy\u2019s, and the Divers\u2019 effect on their friends has many echoes in the Murphys\u2019 effect on theirs. \u201cPeople were always their best selves with the Murphys,\u201d John Dos Passos, who has known them for forty years, has said, and Archibald MacLeish, who has known them even longer, once remarked that from the beginning of the Murphys\u2019 life in Europe, \u201cperson after person\u2014English, French, American, everybody\u2014met them and came away saying that these people really are masters in the art of living.\u201d \u201cAt certain moments,\u201d Fitzgerald wrote in his notes for \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d \u201cone man appropriates to himself the total significance of a time and place.\u201d For Fitzgerald, Gerald and Sara Murphy embodied the significance of that remarkable decade in France, during which, as he once wrote, \u201cwhatever happened seemed to have something to do with art.\u201d Even though Fitzgerald himself showed very little interest in the art of his time, and ignored it completely in \u201cTender Is the Night,\u201d he did respond to the atmosphere of freshness and discovery that characterized the period. When the Fitzgeralds arrived in France, in the spring of 1924, the Murphys had been there for nearly three years, and had become, according to MacLeish, a \u201csort of nexus with everything that was going on.\u201d In various apartments and houses they rented in or near Paris, and at a villa they were renovating at Cap d\u2019Antibes, on the Riviera, one met not only American writers like Hemingway and MacLeish and Dos Passos but a good many of the Frenchmen and other Europeans who were forging the art of the twentieth century\u2014Picasso, who had a studio near them in Paris, and who came down to visit them in Antibes; L\u00e9ger, who liked to take them on nocturnal tours of Paris\u2019s earthy little caf\u00e9s, bars, dance halls, and sideshows; Stravinsky, who came to dinner and unfailingly commented on the flavor of the bread, which Sara sprinkled with water and put into the oven before serving. \u201cThe Murphys were among the first Americans I ever met,\u201d Stravinsky said recently, \u201cand they gave me the most agreeable impression of the United States.\u201d The couple had come to know most of their European friends through the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev, for whom they had both volunteered to work as unpaid apprentices soon after their arrival in Paris in 1921, when they learned that a fire had destroyed most of the company\u2019s scenery. The Murphys, who had been studying painting with one of Diaghilev\u2019s designers, Natalia Goncharova, went to the company\u2019s atelier in the Belleville quarter to help repaint the d\u00e9cors for \u201cScheherazade,\u201d \u201cPulcinella,\u201d and other ballets, and Picasso, Braque, Derain, Bakst, and other Diaghilev artists came by frequently to supervise the work and comment on it. \u201cAnybody who was interested in the Diaghilev ballet company became a member automatically,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cYou knew everybody, you knew all the dancers, and everybody asked your opinion on things. The ballet was the focal center of the whole modern movement in the arts.\u201d", "Certainly no two Americans could have been more ideally conditioned by background and temperament to recognize and respond to everything that was going on, or to feel so thoroughly at home in the excitement of the modern movement. Sara Murphy, the eldest of three daughters of a Cincinnati ink manufacturer named Frank B. Wiborg, had spent a large part of her childhood in Europe with her mother and sisters. The three girls were strikingly beautiful, in entirely different ways: Olga, the youngest, had a serene, classic beauty; Mary Hoyt (\u201cHoytie\u201d) was dramatic, dark, and intense; and Sara\u2019s piquant looks and golden hair reflected the family\u2019s Scandinavian heritage. Their paternal grandfather was Norwegian. Through family connections\u2014Mrs. Wiborg was General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s favorite niece, and a great friend of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\u2014the girls were exposed to London society, where their \u201cAmerican\u201d directness and their unself-conscious talent for singing a wide repertoire of operatic arias and American folk songs in three-part harmony delighted the English. The three sisters were presented at the Court of St. James\u2019s in 1914. (\u201cThat year,\u201d wrote Lady Diana Cooper in her autobiography, \u201cthe Wiborg girls were the rage of London.\u201d) Sara spoke fluent French, German, and Italian, said just what she thought to everyone, and was not in the slightest degree impressed by fashionable society. \u201cI love Sara,\u201d Lady Diana once said to Mrs. Wiborg. \u201cShe\u2019s a cat who goes her own way.\u201d Gerald Murphy, who had known Sara for eleven years before they were married, in 1916 (they met at her family\u2019s summer place in East Hampton), says now that while he would be unable to relate a single incident in his life in which she did not play a part, she has remained so essentially and na\u00efvely original that \u201cto this day I have no idea what she will do, say, or propose.\u201d Until 1921, Gerald Murphy\u2019s contact with Europe had been largely vicarious. His father, Patrick Francis Murphy, for twenty-five years spent five months a year in the capitals of Europe studying the details of the Europeans\u2019 way of life and the implements contrived for it, which he screened and, in many cases, improved upon before putting them on sale in the Mark Cross store, then at Fifth Avenue and Twenty-fifth Street. The elder Murphy introduced, among other items, Minton china, English cut crystal, Scottish golf clubs, and Sheffield cutlery, as well as the first thermos bottle ever seen in the United States. Moreover, he designed and made up the first wristwatch, at the suggestion of a British infantry officer who complained that a pocket watch was too cumbersome for trench warfare. Patrick Murphy had taken over Mark W. Cross\u2019s modest Boston saddlery shop in the eighteen-eighties and built it into an elegant New York store, but he was far from being a typical successful merchant of the era. He spent most of the day reading the English classics in his office (he had a special passion for Macaulay), he was known as the wittiest after-dinner speaker of his time, and he had not the slightest desire to become a wealthy man. Fred Murphy, Gerald\u2019s older brother, chafed under their father\u2019s refusal to see the store expand. (\u201cHow many times must I tell you I don\u2019t want to make more money?\u201d Gerald remembers his father saying.) Their arguments led to an estrangement that was not made up until Fred lay dying of wounds suffered as a tank officer in the First World War; along with one other officer in his regiment, Major George S. Patton (who carried a pearl-handled revolver even then), Fred had volunteered for the first French tank corps, in the days when tank officers ran alongside the tanks to direct their operations. Fred and Gerald were never particularly close. According to Monty Woolley, the actor, who was a class ahead of Gerald at Yale, \u201cThe relation between the brothers was something that always seemed comical to me. Their politeness to one another was formidable. They never relaxed in each other\u2019s presence.\u201d Gerald\u2019s sister, Esther, is ten years younger; she has lived for many years in Paris. Along with his father\u2019s extraordinary taste, Gerald inherited an aversion to the crasser forms of competition, which made him regret his decision to go to Yale. \u201cI was very unhappy there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always felt that you were expected to make good in some form of extracurricular activity, and there was such constant pressure on you that you couldn\u2019t make a stand against it\u2014I couldn\u2019t, anyway.\u201d By not making a stand, he was elected to the top fraternity (DKE), was tapped for Skull and Bones, was made manager of the glee club and chairman of the dance committee, and was voted the best-dressed man in the class of 1911. \u201cThis was the blue-sweater era at Yale,\u201d MacLeish, who was in Bones three years behind Murphy, points out, \u201cand it was most unusual to be tapped for Bones if you weren\u2019t on the football team. Gerald was unimpressed by the honor. When my wife and I went over to Paris in the twenties, everybody wanted us to meet the Murphys\u2014I had not known him at college\u2014but they avoided us for six weeks, and I had the impression it was because Gerald knew I was a Bones man.\u201d Among Murphy\u2019s close friends today are only two men he knew at Yale\u2014Monty Woolley and Cole Porter, who was two classes behind him. After his graduation, Murphy spent six years working for his father in the Mark Cross company. In 1916, he married Sara Wiborg, and the next year enlisted in the aircraft arm of the Signal Corps. He was on the verge of being transferred to the Handley-Page unit in England when the armistice was signed. (\u201cI got to the gangplank at Hoboken,\u201d he says.) By that time, he knew that he did not want to continue at Mark Cross. What, his father inquired, did he want to do? Gerald, who had had no idea until that moment, announced that he wanted to study landscape architecture. \u201cI had to say something,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand that\u2019s what came out.\u201d The Murphys spent the next two years in Cambridge, where Gerald studied at the Harvard School of Landscape Architecture, and then, like a good many of their fellow-countrymen, they decided to live in Europe, even though by this time there were three young Murphys\u2014Honoria, Baoth, and Patrick. \u201cYou had the feeling,\u201d Murphy says, \u201cthat the bluenoses were in the saddle over here, and that a government that could pass the Eighteenth Amendment could, and probably would, do a lot of other things to make life in the States as stuffy and bigoted as possible.\u201d Perhaps more important, according to Sara, was the desire to escape from the pressure of \u201ctwo very powerful families\u2014mine especially.\u201d In any case, they had enough money to live comfortably in Europe, where the rate of exchange was highly favorable to Americans; Sara\u2019s father had recently divided his fortune into equal shares, and the income from Sara\u2019s portion came to seven thousand dollars a year. In 1921, with their three children and with \u201cforeign resident\u201d stamped on their passports, they sailed for Europe and, after a summer in England, settled for the winter in Paris in the H\u00f4tel Beau-Site, near the Etoile. Walking down the Rue de la Bo\u00ebtie one day, Murphy stopped to look in the window of the Rosenberg Gallery, went inside, and saw, for the first time in his life, paintings by Braque and Picasso and Juan Gris. \u201cI was astounded,\u201d he says. \u201cMy reaction to the color and form was immediate; to me there was something in these paintings that was instantly sympathetic and comprehensible and fresh and new. I said to Sara, \u2018If that\u2019s painting, it\u2019s what I want to do.\u2019 \u201d This was the beginning of his career as a painter\u2014a career that lasted for seven years, produced, in all, eight remarkable canvases, and ended as abruptly as it began. His only formal training was with Natalia Goncharova, and at first Sara studied along with him. \u201cWe went to Goncharova\u2019s studio on the Rue Jacob every morning, and she explained to us the elements of modern painting,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cShe started us out with absolutely abstract painting\u2014wouldn\u2019t let us put on canvas anything that resembled anything we had ever seen. Larionov, her husband, used to come in at night and criticize our work.\u201d In a short time, Murphy began to evolve a style of his own, which lay midway between realism and abstraction. His pictures, which were often very large, were characterized by hard, flat color and by a meticulous rendering of objects in the finest detail\u2014a safety razor, the inside of a watch, a wasp devouring a pear. He worked slowly, taking months to complete a picture. In 1923, he was exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, and his work caused a stir among the Paris artists, some of whom saw it as an original contribution; L\u00e9ger, in fact, announced that Murphy was the only American painter in Paris, meaning the only one who had shown a really American response to the new postwar French painting. Not everyone agreed. Segonzac, one of the judges for the 1924 Ind\u00e9pendants, argued strongly against hanging Murphy\u2019s \u201cBoatdeck: Cunarder,\u201d a twelve-by-eighteen-foot canvas showing the stacks and ventilators of an ocean liner; he dismissed it as \u201cpeinture de b\u00e2timent.\u201d He was overruled, and Murphy was photographed for the newspapers standing in front of his gigantic picture, wearing a bowler and a cryptic expression. As hundreds of accounts of the era have by now attested, American expatriate life in Paris in the twenties was in general one of rather self-conscious intellectual ferment. For the Murphys, however, it was something different. Older by a decade than most of their fellow-expatriates, and leading a relatively stable existence that centered largely on their children, they had little in common with the determined bohemianism of many of the Americans in Montparnasse. Most of their American friends were married couples with children, who, like them, had come to live in Paris primarily because, as Gertrude Stein put it, \u201cParis was where the twentieth century was.\u201d \u201cOf all of us over there in the twenties, Gerald and Sara sometimes seemed to be the only real expatriates,\u201d MacLeish said recently. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t stand the people in their social sphere at home, whom they considered stuffy and dull. They had enormous contempt for American schools and colleges, and used to say that their daughter Honoria must never, never marry a boy who had gone to Yale. [Actually, Honoria married a Georgetown University man, and now lives in McLean, Virginia, with her husband and three children.] And yet, at the same time, they both seemed to treasure a sort of Whitmanesque belief in the pure native spirit of America, in the possibility of an American art and music and literature.\u201d The Murphys\u2019 household, in fact, was a place where their fellow-countrymen could keep up with much that was going on at home. Gerald had an arrangement with the drummer in Jimmy Durante\u2019s band to send them, in monthly shipments, the latest jazz records. He imported the new gadgets being produced in America (an electric waffle iron, for one), knew the latest American dances, and read the new American books. The French, who were fascinated by anything American, used to love to hear the Murphys sing Negro folk songs and spirituals, which Gerald had been collecting for years; long before, he had discovered in an old magazine in the Boston Public Library the texts of many songs sung by Southern Negroes during the Civil War, and he and Sara had compiled a large repertoire of these, which they sang in two-part harmony, Gerald singing tenor and Sara alto. They sang them once for Erik Satie, who was delighted with them. The dean of Les Six had a lively interest in Americans (he once wrote that he owed much to Columbus, \u201cbecause the American spirit has occasionally tapped me on the shoulder, and I have been delighted to feel its ironically glacial bite\u201d), and on that occasion he had come to the Paris house of Mrs. Winthrop Chanler expressly to hear the Murphys\u2019 Negro music. As they sang, Murphy played a simple piano accompaniment he had worked out. \u201cAfter we\u2019d finished,\u201d he recalls, \u201cMrs. Chanler asked Satie how he liked them, and he said, \u2018Wonderful, but there should be no piano. Have them turn their backs and do it again.\u2019 So we did the whole thing over without accompaniment, and Satie said \u2018Never sing them any other way\u2019 and left.\u201d For the Murphys and their friends, though, America had not yet caught up with the new century; the center of the world just then was Paris. \u201cEvery day was different,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThere was a tension and an excitement in the air that was almost physical. Always a new exhibition, or a recital of the new music, or a Dadaist manifestation, or a costume ball in Montparnasse, or a premi\u00e8re of a new play or ballet, or one of Etienne de Beaumont\u2019s fantastic \u2018Soir\u00e9es de Paris\u2019 in Montmartre\u2014and you\u2019d go to each one and find everybody else there, too.\u201d One of the major events of the spring of 1923, during the Murphys\u2019 second year in Paris, was the premi\u00e8re of Stravinsky\u2019s ballet \u201cLes Noces\u201d by the Diaghilev company. Of all Stravinsky\u2019s scores, the one for this powerful work, based on the simple, somewhat savage ritual of a Russian peasant wedding, was Diaghilev\u2019s favorite. The impresario was so enthusiastic about it that he had persuaded three well-known composers\u2014Francis Poulenc, Georges Auric, and Vittorio Rieti\u2014to perform three of the four piano parts (Stravinsky had used pianos almost as percussion instruments); the fourth part was played by Marcelle Meyer, the leading interpreter of the new music and a friend of Sara\u2019s and Gerald\u2019s. The Murphys attended all rehearsals, and brought some of their friends, including Dos Passos; he, in turn, brought E. E. Cummings, who sat in the back row and resisted meeting the Murphys. (\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Dos Passos explained. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life keeping my friends apart.\u201d) \u201cThe excitement over \u2018Les Noces\u2019 was rising to such a pitch that we felt moved to do something to celebrate the premi\u00e8re,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cWe decided to have a party for everyone directly related to the ballet, as well as for those friends of ours who were following its genesis. Our idea was to find a place worthy of the event. We first approached the manager of the Cirque M\u00e9drano, but he felt that our party would not be fitting for such an ancient institution. I remember him saying haughtily, \u2018Le Cirque M\u00e9drano n\u2019est pas encore une colonie am\u00e9ricaine.\u2019 Our next thought was the restaurant on a large, transformed p\u00e9niche, or barge, that was tied up in the Seine in front of the Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s and was used exclusively by the deputies themselves every day except Sunday. The management there was delighted with our idea, and couldn\u2019t have been more co\u00f6perative.\u201d The party was held on June 17th, the Sunday following the premi\u00e8re. It began at 7 P.M., and the first person to arrive was Stravinsky, who dashed into the salle \u00e0 manger to inspect, and even rearrange, the distribution of place cards. He was apparently satisfied with his own seating\u2014on the right hand of the Princesse de Polignac, who had commissioned \u201cLes Noces.\u201d Like the famous \u201cBanquet Rousseau,\u201d in 1908, at which Picasso and his friends paid homage to Le Douanier Rousseau, the Murphys\u2019 p\u00e9niche party has assumed over the years a sort of legendary aura, so that people who may or may not have been there give vivid and conflicting descriptions of the event. The forty-odd people who were there constituted a kind of summit meeting of the modern movement in Paris: Picasso, Darius Milhaud, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Ansermet (who conducted \u201cLes Noces\u201d), Germaine Tailleferre, Marcelle Meyer, Diaghilev, Natalia Goncharova and Larionov, Tristan Tzara, Blaise Cendrars, and Scofield Thayer, the editor of the Dial. There were four or five premi\u00e8res danseuses from the company, and two of the male principals, but the Murphys had been advised not to invite the whole corps de ballet; Diaghilev, a stickler for rank, would not have approved. After cocktails on the canopied upper deck of the p\u00e9niche, the guests drifted downstairs to the salle \u00e0 manger\u2014all except Cocteau, whose horror of seasickness was so excruciating that he refused to come on board until the last Seine excursion boat, with its rolling wake, had gone by. The champagne dinner that followed was memorable, and so was the d\u00e9cor. Having discovered at the last moment that it was impossible to buy fresh flowers on a Sunday, the Murphys had gone to a bazaar in Montparnasse and bought up bags and bags of toys\u2014fire engines, cars, animals, dolls, clowns\u2014and they had arranged these in little pyramids at intervals down the long banquet table. Picasso was entranced. He immediately collected a quantity of toys and worked them into a fantastic \u201caccident,\u201d topped off by a cow perched on a fireman\u2019s ladder. Dinner went on for hours, interspersed with music (Ansermet and Marcelle Meyer played a piano at one end of the room) and dancing by the ballerinas. Cocteau finally came aboard. He found his way into the barge captain\u2019s cabin and put on the captain\u2019s dress uniform, and he now went about carrying a lantern and putting his head in at portholes to announce gravely, \u201cOn coule\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re sinking\u201d). At one point, Murphy noted with astonishment that Ansermet and Boris Kochno, Diaghilev\u2019s secretary, had managed to take down an enormous laurel wreath, bearing the inscription \u201cLes Noces\u2014Hommages,\u201d that had been hung from the ceiling, and were holding it for Stravinsky, who ran the length of the room and leaped nimbly through the center. No one really got drunk, no one went home much before dawn, and no one, in all probability, has ever forgotten the party. As Cocteau put it, \u201cDepuis le jour de ma premi\u00e8re communion, c\u2019est le plus beau soir de ma vie.\u201d The Murphys left Paris soon afterward to spend the summer in Antibes. They had discovered the Riviera the preceding summer, when Cole Porter had invited them down to his rented ch\u00e2teau at Cap d\u2019Antibes for two weeks. \u201cCole has always had great originality about finding new places,\u201d Murphy says, \u201cand at that time no one ever went near the Riviera in summer. The English and Germans\u2014there were no longer any Russians\u2014who came down for the short spring season closed their villas as soon as it began to get warm. None of them ever went in the water, you see. When we went to visit Cole, it was hot, hot summer, but the air was dry, and it was cool in the evening, and the water was that wonderful jade-and-amethyst color. Right out on the end of the Cap there was a tiny beach\u2014the Garoupe\u2014only about forty yards long and covered with a bed of seaweed that must have been four feet thick. We dug out a corner of the beach and bathed there and sat in the sun, and we decided that this was where we wanted to be. Oddly, Cole never came back, but from the beginning we knew we were going to.\u201d There was a small hotel on the Cap that had been operated for thirty-five years by Antoine Sella and his family; ordinarily, it closed down on May 1st, when the Sellas went off to manage a hotel in the Italian Alps. That summer, though, the Murphys persuaded Sella to keep the H\u00f4tel du Cap open on a minimum basis, with a cook, a waiter, and a chambermaid as the entire staff, and they moved in with their children, sharing the place with a Chinese family who had been staying there and had decided to remain when they learned that the hotel would stay open. The Murphys\u2019 regular companions that summer were Picasso and his wife, Olga; his young son, Paolo; and his elderly mother, Se\u00f1ora Maria Ruiz. They had come down to visit the Murphys at the Hotel du Cap and had liked the region so much that they took a villa in nearby Antibes. Picasso was working at that time in two radically different styles\u2014the late-Cubist phase that produced such milestones as his 1921 \u201cThree Musicians,\u201d and the monumental, figurative style of his classical period, influenced by his work with the Diaghilev ballet. He was struck by the way Sara slung her pearls down her back when she wore them to the beach (it was \u201cgood for them to get the sun,\u201d she explained), and some of the women in his classical paintings and drawings of this period are shown with pearl necklaces thrown over their shoulders in Sara\u2019s manner. It was a touch that Scott Fitzgerald later made use of when he described Nicole Diver sitting on the beach with \u201cher brown back hanging from her pearls.\u201d Gerald and Sara saw the Picassos nearly every day, and were unfailingly diverted by the painter\u2019s grotesque observations. \u201cHe blagued all the time, about everything,\u201d Gerald says, \u201cand he rarely expressed an idea that was in any way abstract. In fact, the only time I ever remember him saying anything of an abstract sort was one day when we all happened to see an old black farm dog hold up a chauffeur-driven cabriolet by lying stubbornly in the road, in the shade of a fig tree. The chauffeur finally had to get out and shoo him away with a lap robe. Picasso watched the whole pantomime without a shade of expression, and when the car had driven on and the dog had come back to lie down in the road again, he said \u2018Moi, je voudrais \u00eatre un chien.\u2019 \u201d Picasso seemed to be fascinated with Americans at that time. Once, in Paris, he invited the Murphys to his apartment, on the Rue de la Bo\u00ebtie, for an ap\u00e9ritif, and, after showing them through the place, in every room of which were pictures in various stages of completion, he led Gerald rather ceremoniously to an alcove that contained a tall cardboard box. \u201cIt was full of illustrations, photographs, engravings, and reproductions clipped from newspapers,\u201d Murphy recalls. \u201cAll of them dealt with a single person\u2014Abraham Lincoln. \u2018I\u2019ve been collecting them since I was a child,\u2019 Picasso said. \u2018I have thousands, thousands!\u2019 He held up one of Brady\u2019s photographs of Lincoln, and said with great feeling, \u2018Voil\u00e0 la vraie \u00e9l\u00e9gance am\u00e9ricaine! \u2019 \u201d Before the summer was out, the Murphys decided to buy a villa of their own. What they wanted above all was a garden, and they found one on a hill just below the Antibes lighthouse, attached to the home of a French Army officer who had spent most of his professional life as a military attach\u00e9 in the Near East. The villa itself was a sort of chalet, small and unpretentious, but the garden was extraordinary. Each year, returning on home leave, the owner had brought back exotic trees and plants\u2014date palms, Arabian maples with pure-white leaves, pepper trees, olives, ever-bearing lemon trees, black and white figs\u2014all of which had prospered and proliferated. Heliotrope and mimosa ran wild through the garden, which flowed down from the house in a series of levels, intersected by gravel paths. There was hardly a flower that would not grow there, for it was on a side of the hill that was protected from the mistral. At night, the whole place throbbed with nightingales. In \u201cTender Is the Night,\u201d the Divers\u2019 villa is actually a cross between the Murphys\u2019 and a villa, high up above the Corniche near Eze, owned by Samuel Barlow, the American composer. Barlow had razed several ancient peasant cottages to make his garden, and had incorporated several others into his house. The Murphys went to no such lengths with their property, but they did undertake a fairly extensive remodelling of the villa, which required nearly two years to complete. They had the peaked chalet roof replaced with a flat sun roof\u2014one of the first sun roofs ever seen on the Riviera\u2014providing a second story and two bedrooms for the children. They put down an outdoor terrace of gray and white marble tiles, taking great care to preserve a huge silver linden tree, under which they later served almost all their meals. With his unerring eye for good design in everyday objects, Murphy sought out the dealers who serviced the local restaurants and caf\u00e9s and bought a supply of traditional rattan caf\u00e9 chairs and plain deal tables, the legs of which he painted black. Inside, the d\u00e9cor was a trifle severe (black satin furniture and white walls), but the house was always full of Sara\u2019s flowers from the garden, freshly picked and arranged every day\u2014oleanders, tulips, roses, mimosa, heliotrope, jasmine, camellias. While the Villa America, as they had decided to call it, was being renovated, the Murphys returned to Paris for a winter of great activity. Through L\u00e9ger, who was then executing the sets for the Milhaud ballet \u201cLa Cr\u00e9ation du Monde,\u201d Murphy had received a commission to create an \u201cAmerican\u201d ballet that would serve as a curtain-raiser for the main event. Both were to be put on by the Swedish ballet company then resident in Paris, the Ballets Su\u00e9dois. Rolf de Mar\u00e9, the company\u2019s director, asked Murphy whether he knew of any young American composers in Paris who might do a score in the American idiom, and Murphy, without a moment\u2019s hesitation, suggested the little known Cole Porter. The result of their collaboration was \u201cWithin the Quota,\u201d a lively thirty-minute work satirizing the impressions of a young Swedish immigrant to the United States. Gerald worked out the story line and painted a stunning curtain, which was a parody of the Hearst newspapers of the day, with an ocean liner standing on end beside the Woolworth Building; across the top ran a gigantic headline reading, \u201cUNKNOWN BANKER BUYS ATLANTIC.\u201d Cole Porter\u2019s score was a witty parody of the piano music played in silent-movie theatres. Just before the premi\u00e8re, L\u00e9ger had de Mar\u00e9 switch the order of performance; he appeared to feel that the spirited curtain-raiser might attract attention away from the main work. Both ballets, in any case, were warmly received. That spring, the Murphys rented a house that had belonged to Gounod, and still remained in his family, on a hill in Saint-Cloud, overlooking Paris. Archibald MacLeish\u2019s poem \u201cSketch for a Portrait of Mme. G\u2014 M\u2014\u201d describes Sara in terms of her sitting room in this lovely old house (\u201cIts fine proportions in that attitude / of gratified compliance worn by salons / whose white-and-gold has settled into home\u201d), and expresses, incidentally, what all the Murphys\u2019 friends have remarked on at one time or another\u2014their talent for making any place they live in seem a revelation of their own personalities. The Murphys did not entertain lavishly. Although a recent biography of Scott Fitzgerald has them giving parties for forty people at Maxim\u2019s, with Murphy tipping the coatroom attendant in advance to spare the \u201cpoorer artists\u201d in his group any embarrassment (\u201cMy God!\u201d Murphy exclaimed after reading this. \u201cCan you imagine anything more arrogant?\u201d), the fact was that neither he nor Sara could stand large parties (which Sara called \u201cholocausts\u201d), and, with the exception of the f\u00eate for \u201cLes Noces\u201d and one or two others, they never gave them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t parties that made it such a gay time,\u201d Sara says now. \u201cThere was such affection between everybody. You loved your friends and wanted to see them every day, and usually you did see them every day. It was like a great fair, and everybody was so young.\u201d Work on the Villa America was proceeding slowly, and when the Murphys went down to Antibes for the summer of 1924 they had to put up again at the H\u00f4tel du Cap. Several of their friends visited them there\u2014the Gilbert Seldeses (on their honeymoon), Etienne de Beaumont and his wife, and, later on, in August, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and their daughter Frances, or \u201cScottie.\u201d The Murphys had met the Fitzgeralds in Paris that spring, soon after their arrival in Europe. Scott and Zelda had announced that they were fleeing the hectic life of social Long Island, and in June they had settled in Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, where they planned to live on \u201cpractically nothing a year.\u201d When they came over to visit the Murphys at the H\u00f4tel du Cap, it was evident that the quiet life had so far eluded them. Severe marital strains, in fact, had put them both on edge. One night, after they had all gone to bed, the Murphys were awakened by Scott, who stood outside their door with a candle in his violently trembling hand. \u201cZelda\u2019s sick,\u201d he said, and added in a tense voice, as they hurried down the hall, \u201cI don\u2019t think she did it on purpose.\u201d She had swallowed a large, but not fatal, quantity of sleeping pills, and they had to spend the rest of the night walking her up and down to keep her awake. For the Murphys, it was the first of many experiences with the Fitzgeralds\u2019 urge toward self-destruction. Later in their stay, when Sara remonstrated with them for their dangerous habit of coming back late from parties and then, on Zelda\u2019s initiative, diving into the sea from thirty-five-foot rocks, fully clothed in evening dress, Zelda turned her wide, penetrating eyes on her and said innocently, \u201cBut, Sara\u201d\u2014she pronounced it \u201cSay-ra\u201d\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t you know? We don\u2019t believe in conservation.\u201d Toward the end of the summer, work on the Villa America had progressed far enough for the Murphys to move in, and from that time until they left Europe for good, ten years later, it was their real home, although they also kept a small apartment on the Quai des Grands-Augustins, on the Left Bank. They went up to Paris at least once a month and stayed in close touch with everything that was going on in the capital\u2014that winter, Gerald exhibited a six-by-six-foot \u201cminiature on a giant scale\u201d of the inside of a watch at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants\u2014but the Cap d\u2019Antibes was now their base. Murphy had converted a gardener\u2019s cottage into a studio, where he worked a good part of every day. Another small farmhouse, or bastide, on the property had been made over into a guest cottage. The children\u2014then three, five, and six\u2014were overjoyed by the new arrangements, and it seemed to most of the Murphys\u2019 friends that the life of this fortunate family had fallen into its true pattern.", "Those closest to the Murphys find it almost impossible to describe the special quality of their life, or the charm it had for their friends. An evening spent in their fragrant garden, looking out over the water toward Cannes and the mountains beyond, listening to records from Gerald\u2019s encyclopedic collection (everything from Bach to the latest jazz), savoring the delicious food that always seemed to appear, exquisitely prepared and served, at the precise moment and under the precise circumstances guaranteed to bring out all its best qualities (Proven\u00e7al dishes, for the most part, with vegetables and fruits from the Murphys\u2019 garden, though there was often a typically American dish, such as poached eggs on a bed of creamed corn); the passionate attention to every detail of his guests\u2019 pleasure that gave Murphy himself such obvious pleasure; Sara\u2019s piquant beauty and wit, and the intense joy she took in her life and her friends; the three beautiful children, who seemed, like most children who inhabit a special private world, to be completely at home in adult company (Honoria, who looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly; Baoth, robust and athletic; Patrick, disturbingly delicate, and with a mercurial brilliance that made him seem \u201cmore Gerald than Gerald\u201d)\u2014all contributed to an atmosphere that most people felt wonderfully privileged to share. \u201cA party at the Murphys had its own rhythm, and there was never a jarring note,\u201d Gilbert Seldes recalls. \u201cBoth of them had a passion for entertaining and for other people.\u201d The central fact in all this was the marriage itself, which often seemed the most entrancing of all the Murphys\u2019 creations. \u201cThe marriage was unshakable,\u201d says Dos Passos. \u201cThey complemented each other, backed each other up in a way that was absolutely remarkable.\u201d As with most good marriages, though, the Murphys\u2019 was in many respects a matching of opposites. Sara was frank, direct, even brusque at times; she said what she thought, and she didn\u2019t flirt. \u201cSara is incorruptible,\u201d Mrs. Winthrop Chanler once remarked in admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard her say a silly or indifferent thing.\u201d And yet, with all her candor, Sara took her life and her friends largely, delighted in them, and was rarely provoked. Like her mother\u2019s old friend Mrs. Patrick Campbell, who often visited them at Antibes, she \u201cdidn\u2019t care much what people did, so long as they didn\u2019t do it out in the streets and frighten the horses.\u201d Gerald\u2019s style, one felt, was a more conscious creation. \u201cSara is in love with life and skeptical of people,\u201d Gerald once told Fitzgerald. \u201cI\u2019m the other way. I believe you have to do things to life to make it tolerable. I\u2019ve always liked the old Spanish proverb: \u2018Living well is the best revenge.\u2019 \u201d Gerald\u2019s Celtic good looks; his beautiful clothes, which would have seemed a trifle too elegant if anyone else had worn them; his perfectionist attention to subtle gradations of feeling\u2014these sometimes acted as a barrier to intimacy, so much so that Fitzgerald once accused him of \u201ckeeping people away with charm.\u201d \u201cOh, Gerald could be preposterous in those days,\u201d one of their best friends recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d become wildly enthusiastic about something like pacifism, and go around asking if you really wanted to kill people, and he loved to talk in aphorisms\u2014\u2018I think the best way to educate children is to keep them confused,\u2019 he would say, and then keep on saying it. Also, at times a chill would descend. He has always been the most Irish person I know, and when the black mood came over him, he was absolutely unreachable. But then he could be utterly captivating when he wanted to, which was most of the time. You had this feeling that he was doing all kinds of things for your pleasure, and always with the most exquisite taste.\u201d It was, as MacLeish has pointed out, taste in the positive sense\u2014not simply the opposite of bad taste\u2014that the Murphys lived by. \u201cGerald could take something you hadn\u2019t even noticed and make you see how good it was,\u201d MacLeish says. \u201cHe knew all about Early American folk art, for example, long before the museums started collecting it, and he could tell you the towns along the New England coast where you could go and see marvellous old weather vanes or painted signs. He has always had this capacity for enriching your life with things he\u2019s found\u2014like those old Negro spirituals, like his collection of rare recordings of the early Western songs, which Nicolas Nabokov used when he wrote the music for our \u2018Union Pacific\u2019 ballet. Gerald had no interest at all in poetry until I introduced him to Gerard Manley Hopkins, and that set him off; he used to pin a Hopkins poem to his shaving mirror every morning, and to this day he can recite a good many of them. In return, he gave me back Wordsworth, whom I had long abandoned and thought dreadfully dull. Just four lines he\u2019d seen, and how they sprang out!\u201d The long, quiet days at Antibes centered on the beach, which Gerald gradually cleared of seaweed; on the garden; and on the little port, where the Murphys always kept a boat. They loved to cruise, and had a succession of boats, beginning with a small sloop, the Picaflor, progressing through a somewhat larger one, named after Honoria, and culminating in the hundred-foot schooner Weatherbird, which was designed and built by a member of the Diaghilev troupe, Vladimir Orloff, who had attached himself to the Murphy family in Paris and had come down to live in Antibes when they built the Villa America. Orloff, the son of a Russian nobleman who had managed the private bank account of the Czarina, had seen his father murdered by the Bolsheviks soon after the October Revolution; escaping from Russia, he had made his way to France, where, like so many of the young White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, he gravitated to Diaghilev. He worked for Diaghilev as a set designer, but his real m\u00e9tier, born of a childhood spent on his grandfather\u2019s yachts on the Black Sea, was naval architecture. He designed the Weatherbird along the lines of the American clipper ships, which he considered the most beautiful vessels ever launched. (The Weatherbird took its name from a Louis Armstrong record with that title, which the Murphys had sealed into its keel.) Life at the Villa America was too varied, though, to allow for the establishment of any sort of daily routine. The Murphys usually had friends staying with them, in the bastide or at the Ferme des Orangers, a donkey stable that they had converted into a fully equipped housekeeping cottage in an orange grove across the road from the Villa America. (Robert Benchley, who spent a summer there with his wife and two sons, rechristened it \u201cLa Ferme D\u00e9rang\u00e9e.\u201d) They also travelled continually, not only to Paris and back but all around Europe, often with another couple. During the summer of 1926, they went to the fiesta in Pamplona with Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, and Hadley\u2019s friend Pauline Pfeiffer, who later became the second Mrs. Hemingway. \u201cWhen you were with Ernest, and he suggested that you try something, you didn\u2019t refuse,\u201d Murphy recalls dryly. \u201cHe suggested that I test my nerve in the bull ring with the yearlings. I took along my, raincoat and shook it about, and all of a sudden this animal\u2014it was just a yearling and the horns were padded, but it looked about the size of a locomotive to me\u2014came right for me, at top speed. Evidently, I was so terrified that I just stood there holding the coat in front of me. Ernest, who had been watching very carefully to see that I didn\u2019t get into any trouble, yelled \u2018Hold it to the side!\u2019 and miraculously, at the last moment, I moved the coat to my left and the bull veered toward it and went past. Ernest was delighted. He said I\u2019d made a veronica.\u201d Hemingway adored Sara Murphy, but he seems to have had reservations about Gerald. He judged men according to his own rigorous standards of masculinity (his favorite comment then about someone he admired was \u201cYou\u2019d like him\u2014he\u2019s tough\u201d), and Gerald, despite his performance in the bull ring, was perhaps not tough enough to suit Hemingway. At the same time, Gerald always felt a tacit competitiveness on Hemingway\u2019s part, which weighed on their relationship. More than once, when Murphy expressed an opinion with which Hemingway agreed, Hemingway turned on him and said, somewhat resentfully, \u201cYou Irish know things you\u2019ve never earned the right to know.\u201d As a result of these undercurrents, Gerald was never as close to Hemingway as he was to Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.", "The Fitzgeralds and the Murphys had seen a great deal of one another in Paris in the winter of 1925-26, during which Sara and Gerald had assumed, more or less unwittingly, the role of friendly guardians. A decade older than the Fitzgeralds, they looked upon their baroque exploits with a mixture of tolerant amusement and genuine concern, and the Fitzgeralds, for their part, often went out of their way to try to shock the Murphys. \u201cScott couldn\u2019t bear to be ignored,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cIf he felt that Sara was not paying enough attention to him, he would try to irritate her, or even revolt her\u2014like the time she was riding in a taxi with Scott and Zelda and Teddy Chanler, the composer, and Scott suddenly pulled out some filthy old hundred-franc notes and began stuffing them into his mouth and chewing them.\u201d Even in the early days, it was an odd friendship. The two couples had almost nothing in common except their great affection for each other. Neither Scott nor Zelda seemed to have the slightest interest in the art, the music, the ballet, or even the literature of the period; Scott knew the American writers in Paris, and spent a large part of his time that winter getting Hemingway recognized, but he met few Europeans, and he never learned to speak more than a few words of French, which he made not the slightest effort to pronounce correctly. The simpler aspects of the Murphys\u2019 life at Antibes\u2014their cultivation of the life of the senses\u2014never appealed to Fitzgerald at all. He scarcely noticed what he was eating or drinking. He stayed out of the sun as much as possible, and his skin never lost its dead-white pallor. When the others on the beach went in swimming, Scott would get up, take a flat running dive into the shallow water, and come right out again. He never showed any curiosity about Murphy\u2019s painting, and appeared to consider it a mere diversion. Gerald, for his part, was not particularly impressed with Fitzgerald as a writer. He had not cared much for \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d (Sara had), and neither of them read the Fitzgerald stories that were appearing (infrequently just then) in the Saturday Evening Post. \u201cThe one we took seriously was Ernest, not Scott,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI suppose it was because Ernest\u2019s work seemed contemporary and new, and Scott\u2019s didn\u2019t.\u201d None of this seems to have interfered with their spontaneous liking for each other, however. \u201cWe four communicate by our presence rather than by any other means,\u201d Murphy wrote to the Fitzgeralds in 1925. \u201cCurrents race between us regardless: Scott will uncover for me values in Sara, just as Sara has known them in Zelda through her affection for Scott.\u201d Looking back on the friendship today, both the Murphys tend to stress their feeling for Zelda. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have taken Scott alone,\u201d Gerald has said. Sara, particularly, liked this striking girl. \u201cShe hardly ever said anything that wasn\u2019t personal,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe used to do such odd things, even back in the early days. We were sitting at a table in the Casino at Juan-les-Pins one day, just the two of us, and a man came over to be introduced. Zelda smiled her beautiful smile and sweetly murmured a taunt of her Alabama school days, \u2018I hope you die in the marble ring,\u2019\u2014but not quite loud enough to be heard by the man, who thought she was making the usual pleasantry. And the strange thing was that no matter what she did\u2014even the wildest, most terrifying things\u2014she always managed to maintain her dignity. She was a good woman, and I\u2019ve never thought she was bad for Scott, as other people have said.\u201d The Murphys\u2019 feeling for Zelda sometimes bothered Scott, who would demand to know whether they \u201cliked Zelda better than me.\u201d In February, 1926, the Fitzgeralds rented a villa in Juan-les-Pins and stayed on the Riviera through the following October. The summer, which began very gaily, ended by putting a severe strain on the Fitzgerald-Murphy friendship. The Riviera was no longer the quiet summer retreat it had been in 1923. It had begun to fill up with Americans, for one thing; some were old friends\u2014the Charles Bracketts with their two children, Alexander Woollcott, the MacLeishes, the Philip Barrys (Barry later used the Murphys\u2019 terrace as the setting for his play \u201cHotel Universe\u201d)\u2014but a good many more were not. The H\u00f4tel du Cap was filled to capacity, and the little Garoupe beach now had a row of bathhouses for its clientele. The Murphys\u2019 role in this rapidly changing scene was difficult to define. Their life centered on their children and their beautiful garden, and they never participated in the sort of high jinks that the Fitzgeralds were forever cooking up, such as kidnapping waiters and threatening to saw them in half. Even so, the Murphys, with their children and their house guests, their amusing talk, and their midmorning ritual of dry sherry and sweet biscuits, were generally the focus of the day\u2019s activities on the beach that Gerald had reclaimed. Fitzgerald\u2019s attitude toward the Murphys, and especially toward Gerald, had by this time become somewhat ambivalent. His affection for Sara was close to being an infatuation; he would sit gazing at her across the dinner table for long periods, and say, \u201cSara, look at me.\u201d (Zelda, whose jealousies were notable, was never jealous of Sara, though.) For Gerald, he sometimes evinced an absolute and uncritical admiration. \u201cScott used to ask Gerald for advice on literary matters,\u201d says MacLeish. \u201cHe seemed to feel that Gerald\u2019s superb taste must apply to everything.\u201d At the same time, Fitzgerald often appeared to be under a compulsion to ridicule Murphy\u2019s elegant style. \u201cI suppose you have some special plan for us today,\u201d he would jeer upon meeting Murphy at the beach. Once, on the terrace at the Villa America, Murphy held up a hand and said portentously, \u201cI hear a pulsing motor at the door.\u201d \u201cGod, how that sort of remark dates you!\u201d snapped Fitzgerald, completely missing the deliberate archaism. Fitzgerald\u2019s ambivalence toward the Murphys was possibly related to his feeling that they were wealthier than in fact they were. The complex of illusions and emotions in which Fitzgerald always enveloped the rich is well known, and once, in a letter to Edmund Wilson, he coupled the Murphys with Tommy Hitchcock as his only \u201crich friends;\u201d he seems to have had no understanding of the gulf that lay between the Hitchcocks\u2019 scale of living and the Murphys\u2019. He often asked Murphy, in his na\u00efve way, what their annual income was, and when Murphy would try to explain that they did not live entirely on income\u2014that they simply spent what they wanted to spend, and constantly reduced their capital to do so\u2014Fitzgerald would merely look blank. Scott and Zelda lived poorly on a great deal of money; the Murphys lived extremely well on considerably less. They had no rich friends, and took pains to avoid the sort of wealthy society people who had started coming down to Cannes and Nice. But their money was inherited and they had more of it than most of the people around them, and since they did live extremely well, Fitzgerald\u2019s affection for them was tainted with some of the animosity and awe that he inevitably felt for the very rich. When he was drinking heavily, as he did more and more that summer, this hostility took concrete form. He was scornful of the idea of a caviar-and-champagne party that the Murphys gave one evening at the Casino in Juan-les-Pins, and he set out quite deliberately to wreck it. \u201cHe made all sorts of derogatory remarks about the caviar-and-champagne notion to begin with, evidently because he thought it the height of affectation,\u201d Murphy recalls. \u201cWe were all sitting at a big table on the terrace\u2014the MacLeishes and the Hemingways and a few others\u2014and when a beautiful young girl with a much older man sat down at the next table, Scott turned his chair all the way around to stare at them, and stayed that way until the girl became so irritated that the headwaiter was summoned. They moved to another table. Then Scott took to lobbing ashtrays over to a table on the other side of us. He would toss one and then double up with laughter; he really had the most appalling sense of humor, sophomoric and\u2014well, trashy. The headwaiter was summoned again. It was getting so unpleasant that I couldn\u2019t take it any more, so I got up and left the party. And Scott was furious with me for doing so.\u201d Not long afterward, the Murphys gave a party at the Villa America that could have been, and probably was, the model for the Divers\u2019 famous dinner party in \u201cTender Is the Night.\u201d Fitzgerald again seemed to be under some compulsion to spoil the evening, which he later re-created with such sensitivity in his novel. He started things off inauspiciously by walking up to one of the guests, a young writer, and asking him in a loud, jocular tone whether he was a homosexual. The man quietly said \u201cYes,\u201d and Fitzgerald retreated in temporary embarrassment. When dessert came, Fitzgerald picked a fig from a bowl of pineapple sherbet and threw it at the Princesse de Caraman-Chimay, a house guest of the Murphys\u2019 friend and neighbor, the Princesse de Poix. It hit her between the shoulder blades; she stiffened for a moment and then went on talking as though nothing had happened. At this point, MacLeish took Fitzgerald aside, suggested that he behave himself, and received for his pains, without warning, a roundhouse right to the jaw. Then Fitzgerald, apparently still feeling that not enough attention was being paid him, began throwing Sara\u2019s gold-flecked Venetian wineglasses over the garden wall. He had smashed three of them this way before Gerald stopped him. As the party was breaking up, Gerald went up to Scott (among the last to leave) and told him that he would not be welcome in their house for three weeks\u2014a term of banishment that was observed to the day. Such incidents were bad enough, but the Murphys were even more disturbed by the Fitzgeralds\u2019 accelerating process of self-destruction. Scott\u2019s work was practically at a standstill. Although he talked about the new novel he was writing (the book that became, after eight years and countless revisions, \u201cTender Is the Night\u201d), he hardly ever seemed to be working. (Fitzgerald produced no short stories at all from February of 1926 until June, 1927.) He was often depressed and uneasy about his talent, and his drinking had become a serious problem. Most of the Fitzgeralds\u2019 spectacular escapades that summer, which have been enshrined in the Fitzgerald canon by his biographers, were blatantly self-destructive: Zelda plunging down a flight of stone steps because Scott had gone to make obeisance to Isadora Duncan, at the next table; Scott and Zelda returning from dinner with the Murphys at a restaurant in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, driving their little car onto a trolley-car trestle, and falling sound asleep there until early the next morning, when a farmer saw them and pulled their car to safety a minute or two before the trolley was due; Zelda throwing herself under the wheels of their car after a party and urging Scott to drive over her, and Scott starting to do so. Their behavior alienated a good many people that summer, but the Murphys stuck by them and worried deeply about them both. \u201cWhat we loved about Scott,\u201d Gerald says, \u201cwas the region in him where his gift came from, and which was never completely buried. There were moments when he wasn\u2019t harassed or trying to shock you, moments when he\u2019d be gentle and quiet, and he\u2019d tell you his real thoughts about people, and lose himself in defining what he felt about them. Those were the moments when you saw the beauty of his mind and nature, and they compelled you to love and value him.\u201d The Fitzgeralds went home to America in December, and the Murphys had what Sara, in a letter to Scott and Zelda, described as a \u201cgrand quiet spring\u201d following \u201ca dash through Central Europe with the MacLeishes.\u201d (\u201cBut we never went to Russia as planned,\u201d she added, \u201cas by the time we got visas the theatres had closed and the snow started to melt, not to mention the opening of the season for executions.\u201d) The summer of 1927 was relatively quiet, too, without the Fitzgeralds to contend with, and Murphy was painting steadily. The Fitzgeralds had settled outside Wilmington after a brief, riotous sojourn in Hollywood, and the news from and about them was far from reassuring. When they decided to come over to Europe for the summer of 1928, though, the Murphys were delighted. \u201cIt will be great to see you both again, because we are very fond of you both,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t get on always has nothing to do with it.\u201d Nobody got on with Scott and Zelda that summer. Scott\u2019s drinking was worse than ever. Zelda\u2019s sudden decision, at the age of twenty-eight, to become a professional ballet dancer led to constant friction between them, although Scott outwardly supported her efforts and got Murphy to arrange for her to take lessons with Egarova, who had been a dancer with the Diaghilev company. For the Murphy children, though, the summer was a lovely one. Its highlight was an overnight trip on the sloop Honoria to a cove beyond Saint-Tropez, where Vladimir Orloff, digging in the sand to pitch a tent, \u201cdiscovered\u201d an ancient map with detailed instructions, in archaic French, that led them to a series of further clues, and finally, with almost unbearably mounting excitement, to the unearthing of a chest containing key-winder watches, compasses, spyglasses, and (for Honoria) a quantity of glittering antique and imitation jewels. Honoria has said that it was not until years later that any of the children suspected the authenticity of the find. On a visit to the United States in the late fall of 1928, the Murphy family went across the country by train, stopping off at a ranch in Montana to join the Hemingways, and then going on to Hollywood, where Murphy served as consultant to King Vidor on the filming of the all-Negro film \u201cHallelujah;\u201d Fitzgerald had told Vidor about Murphy\u2019s collection of old Negro songs and spirituals, and Vidor wanted to use them in the film. It was not a completely successful venture; Hollywood was then in the midst of the transition from silent pictures to talkies\u2014\u201cHallelujah\u201d itself changed to sound in mid-production\u2014and the confusion was total. But the summer of 1929, back at the Villa America, was one of the happiest the Murphys had spent, full of gaiety and good friends. Honoria Murphy, then twelve, remembers looking down at the terrace from her bedroom window, seeing the flowers and the lovely food and the ladies in their beaded dresses, and thinking \u201chow it all blended in, and how you just wanted it to last forever.\u201d The Fitzgeralds were back again, too, like ghosts at the banquet. Torn and hounded by their personal furies, they would have been difficult company under any circumstances, but now another severe strain had been put on their relationship with the Murphys. Scott had decided to use Sara and Gerald as the central characters in his novel, and he was \u201cstudying\u201d them openly. His methods were anything but subtle. \u201cHe questioned us constantly in a really intrusive and irritating way,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cHe kept asking things like what our income was, and how I had got into Skull and Bones, and whether Sara and I had lived together before we were married. I just couldn\u2019t take seriously the idea that he was really going to write about us\u2014somehow I couldn\u2019t believe that anything would come of questions like that. But I certainly recall his peering at me with a sort of thin-lipped, supercilious scrutiny, as though he were trying to decide what made me tick. His questions irritated Sara a good deal. Usually, she would give him some ridiculous answer just to shut him up, but eventually the whole business became intolerable. In the middle of a dinner party one night, Sara had all she could take. \u2018Scott,\u2019 she said, \u2018you think if you just ask enough questions you\u2019ll get to know what people are like, but you won\u2019t. You don\u2019t really know anything at all about people.\u2019 Scott practically turned green. He got up from the table and pointed his finger at her and said that nobody had ever dared say that to him, whereupon Sara asked if he would like her to repeat it, and she did.\u201d Sara had felt for a long time that Scott was too wrapped up in himself to understand even those closest to him, and she was not alone in this opinion; Hemingway warned him in a letter that he had stopped listening to other people, with the result that he heard only the answers to his own questions. Sara put her own irritation succinctly in a note to Scott soon after the incident at the dinner table. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect anyone to like or stand a continual feeling of analysis, & subanalysis & criticism\u2014on the whole unfriendly\u2014such as we have felt for quite a while,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is definitely in the air\u2014& quite unpleasant. . . . If you don\u2019t know what people are like it\u2019s your loss. . . . But you ought to know at your age that you can\u2019t have Theories about friends. If you can\u2019t take friends largely, & without suspicion\u2014then they are not friends at all.\u201d A subsequent note from Sara was even more explicit: \u201cWe have no doubt of the loyalty of your affections (and we hope you haven\u2019t of ours) but consideration for other people\u2019s feelings, opinions, or even time is completely left out of your makeup. . . . You don\u2019t even know what Zelda or Scottie are like\u2014in spite of your love for them. It seemed to us the other night (Gerald too) that all you thought and felt about them was in terms of yourself. . . . I feel obliged in honesty of a friend to write you: that the ability to know what another person feels in a given situation will make\u2014or ruin\u2014lives. Your infuriating but devoted and rather wise old friend, Sara.\u201d Fitzgerald never replied, but some years later, in a long letter, he tried to tell Sara a little of what her friendship meant to him: In my theory, utterly opposite to Ernest\u2019s, about fiction, i.e. that it takes half a dozen people to make a synthesis strong enough to create a fiction character\u2014in that theory, or rather in despite of it, I used you again and again in Tender: \u201cHer face was hard & lovely & pitiful\u201d and again \u201cHe had been heavy, belly-frightened with love of her for years\u201d \u2014in those and in a hundred other places I tried to evoke not you but the effect that you produce on men\u2014the echoes and reverberations\u2014a poor return for what you have given by your living presence, but nevertheless an artist\u2019s (what a word!) sincere attempt to preserve a true fragment rather than a \u201cportrait\u201d by Mr. Sargent. . . . I know that you and Gerald are one & it is hard to separate one of you from the other, in such a matter for example as the love and encouragement you chose to give to people who were full of life, rather than to others, equally interesting and less exigent, who were frozen into rigid names. I don\u2019t praise you for this\u2014it was the little more, the little immeasurable portion of a millimeter, the thing at the absolute top, that makes the difference between a World\u2019s Champion and an also-ran, the little glance when you were sitting with Archie on the sofa that you threw at me and said: \u201cAnd\u2014Scott!\u201d taking me in too, and with a heart so milked of compassion by your dearest ones that no person in the world but you would have that little more to spare.", "Sara\u2019s warning was prophetic, although she did not suspect at the time how very close to ruin the Fitzgeralds\u2019 lives had veered. Scott and Zelda left Antibes in October to spend the winter in Paris, where Zelda sank deeper and deeper into the schizophrenia that culminated, the following April, in her mental breakdown. Whether or not Scott understood Zelda\u2019s tragedy, he saw pretty clearly what was happening to him, and, with his writer\u2019s honesty, he faced up to it squarely in his portrait of Dick Diver. Dick\u2019s long \u201cprocess of deterioration\u201d has its origins, like Fitzgerald\u2019s, in a fatal weakness of character; wanting to be good, to be kind, to be brave and wise, Diver \u201chad wanted, even more than that, to be loved.\u201d Fitzgerald\u2019s own deterioration has the elements of a classic morality play, which may be one reason for the popular appeal of the Fitzgerald saga; the fact that Fitzgerald recognized his self-indulgence and yet never quite gave up the effort to be a first-rate writer gives the story its tragic dignity. It would be hard to believe that Fitzgerald ever considered Gerald Murphy to be self-indulgent in this sense, or that he attributed the catastrophe that overtook the Murphys in 1929 to anything but a gratuitous slap of fate. Perhaps the strange irony of circumstances and of coincidence helped convince him that he and Zelda and Gerald and Sara were somehow identified\u2014were indeed \u201cthe same people\u201d\u2014but there was nothing in the events themselves to justify this notion. In October, 1929, soon after the Fitzgeralds left for Paris, the Murphys\u2019 youngest child, Patrick, then nine, developed a persistent fever, which was first diagnosed as bronchitis and then found to be tuberculosis. While Sara and the others remained behind to close the house, Gerald took Patrick to a sanatorium at Montana-Vermala, in the Swiss Alps. This village was the family\u2019s home for the next eighteen months. The Murphys did everything they could to keep their own and Patrick\u2019s spirits up during the long ordeal. They rented a chalet on a mountain near the hospital, and furnished it with all their customary skill. Friends came to visit\u2014Hemingway, Dos Passos, Dorothy Parker (for six months), Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife\u2014and Fitzgerald came up frequently from Prangins, near Geneva, where Zelda had been placed in a sanatorium. Determined not to succumb to the gloomy atmosphere in the village, nearly all of whose inhabitants were tuberculosis sufferers in one stage or another, Gerald and Sara bought an abandoned little bar and dance hall there, did it over completely in American style, and engaged a five-piece band from Munich to come up and play dance music on Friday and Saturday nights. The Murphys\u2019 refusal to go under was profoundly moving to their friends. \u201cThe memory of a night with the gay Murphys of Paris and Antibes in that rarefied cold silence and atmosphere of death is one of the most terrifying of my life,\u201d Stewart said recently. \u201cBut I am prouder of them for that fight for Patrick than for anything else in their lives. The point is, they were not only the most alive, the most charming, the most understanding people\u2014they were, when the roof of their dream house crashed into their beautiful living room, the bravest.\u201d After a year and a half in Switzerland, Patrick was thought to be cured, and the Murphys returned to the Villa America. They spent two more years there, and these were in a sense a coda to the decade that had ended so jarringly for so many people in 1929. Many of their friends had gone home to America. Murphy no longer painted; he had stopped abruptly when Patrick first became ill, and he never took it up again. (His own explanation is that he realized by then that \u201cI was not going to be first rate, and I couldn\u2019t stand second-rate painting.\u201d His total production\u2014eight paintings\u2014was exhibited in a one-man show by the Bernheim Jeune gallery in Paris in 1936, and in 1960 five of the pictures were sent on a tour of American museums in a show assembled by the Dallas Museum for Contemporary Arts, which now has three of them in its permanent collection.) The Murphys spent a great part of their time cruising the Mediterranean on their new schooner, the Weatherbird. But the world was changing, and the Riviera had lost its innocence. Putting into a tiny Italian harbor one day, they were surrounded by a group of swimmers shouting \u201cMare nostrum! \u201d and when they went ashore they found pictures of Mussolini plastered on every wall. At Antibes, the H\u00f4tel du Cap was now the Grand H\u00f4tel du Cap, and its expensive new Eden-Roc swimming club functioned from mid-June to mid-August as an adjunct of the American film colony. \u201cAt the most gorgeous paradise for swimmers on the Mediterranean,\u201d Fitzgerald wrote, \u201cno one swam any more, save for a short hangover dip at noon. . . . The Americans were content to discuss each other in the bar.\u201d Then in 1933, Patrick\u2019s symptoms suddenly recurred in a new and grave form, and the Murphys decided it was time to go home. They sold the Weatherbird (to a Swiss, who was arrested after the war for using it to smuggle gold from Turkey into France), closed the Villa America against their eventual return, and sailed for New York. They have never been back. By the time \u201cTender Is the Night\u201d came out, in 1934, the era, the places, and the emotions that the book evoked seemed fairly remote to the Murphys. Dick Diver seemed to have very little to do with Gerald, and if Fitzgerald had drawn a great many details, conversations, and incidents from life, he had somehow managed to leave out most of the elements of the Murphys\u2019 experience in Europe that mattered to them\u2014the excitement of the modern movement in Paris, the good friends, the sheer sensuous joy of living at Cap d\u2019Antibes. And yet, a year later, when Baoth, the Murphys\u2019 older son, died of spinal meningitis that developed with shocking suddenness from a case of measles he caught at school, Gerald could write to Scott from the depths of his grief, \u201cI know now that what you said in \u2018Tender Is the Night\u2019 is true. Only the invented part of our life\u2014the unreal part\u2014has had any scheme, any beauty. Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed. . . . How ugly and blasting it can be, and how idly ruthless.\u201d Then, in January, 1937, the long fight to save Patrick\u2019s life ended in a hospital at Saranac Lake. One of the things that kept Murphy going during these years was the necessity of coping with a family economic crisis. The Mark Cross company, from which he had escaped so happily years before, had gone precipitously downhill since the death of Patrick Francis Murphy, in 1931, and was now about a million dollars in debt and under pressure to declare itself bankrupt. Murphy was obliged to assume responsibility for the firm. Taking over the management, he retained full control for the next twenty-two years, during which he cleared the debts, moved the store to its present Fifth Avenue address, and applied his imagination and taste to a variety of new items, which proved extremely profitable. But the work, he says, was never congenial and often seemed like sleepwalking. \u201cThe ship foundered, was refloated, set sail again, but not on the same course, nor for the same port,\u201d he once wrote. In the years since they left Europe, the Murphys have continued to live simply and\u2014in accordance with Gerald\u2019s Spanish proverb\u2014very well, following closely the new movements in art, music, and literature. Curiously, having never particularly cared to own paintings or hang them in their houses, they never bought any of the work of the modern masters who were their friends. In a summer cottage they have at East Hampton, though, there is one magnificent L\u00e9ger, which they acquired by what Murphy still feels to be a small miracle. L\u00e9ger made his first trip to the United States in 1931 as the Murphys\u2019 guest (he was seasick the whole trip), and they were instrumental in getting him introduced to the right people at the Museum of Modern Art, which gave him a big one-man show in 1935. At the vernissage of that exhibition, L\u00e9ger came up to Gerald and Sara and said that there was one picture in the show he wanted them to have, and that he would present it to them as a gift if they could pick it out. There were more than two hundred canvases on view, and Gerald quickly despaired of fixing on the right one. But as he and Sara descended a flight of stairs she pointed to a picture on the wall at the foot of the stairway and said, \u201cI think I see it.\u201d The colors, mostly muted browns and reds, were unlike anything they had ever known him to use before. While they were looking at it, L\u00e9ger came up behind them and said, \u201cI see you\u2019ve found it.\u201d He turned the painting around and showed them, written on the frame, \u201cPour Sara et G\u00e9rald.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/07/28/living-well-is-the-best-revenge", "keywords": ["gerald", "paris", "murphy", "american", "revenge", "murphys", "best", "fitzgerald", "friends", "scott", "life", "living", "sara"], "summary": "Gerald Murphy raised the same point when he read the novel, which was dedicated \u201cTo Gerald and Sara\u2014Many F\u00eates,\u201d and Fitzgerald\u2019s reply, Murphy recalled the other day, almost floored him.\nHe said I\u2019d made a veronica.\u201d Hemingway adored Sara Murphy, but he seems to have had reservations about Gerald.\nThe simpler aspects of the Murphys\u2019 life at Antibes\u2014their cultivation of the life of the senses\u2014never appealed to Fitzgerald at all.\n\u201cThe one we took seriously was Ernest, not Scott,\u201d Murphy says.\n\u201cWhat we loved about Scott,\u201d Gerald says, \u201cwas the region in him where his gift came from, and which was never completely buried.", "authors": ["Calvin Tomkins", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "David Remnick", "Mark Singer"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "66b02866-cda0-3a5c-b257-892c68b40fc3"}
