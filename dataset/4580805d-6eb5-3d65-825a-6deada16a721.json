Just as the genre was moving toward polished sheen, he preferred iron and concrete \u2014 rapping with a muscular throatiness that conveyed an excitable kind of mayhem. The staccato bursts on \u201cRuff Ryders\u2019 Anthem\u201d \u2014 an early Swizz Beatz masterpiece \u2014 matched DMX\u2019s jabs of melancholy: \u201cAll I know is pain/All I feel is rain.\u201d", "His voice was unrelentingly coarse, and in his peak era, between 1998 and 2003, he used it for one chest-puffed anthem after another: \u201cParty Up (Up in Here),\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s My Name?,\u201d \u201cWho We Be,\u201d \u201cX Gon\u2019 Give It to Ya,\u201d \u201cWhere the Hood At?\u201d Often, he rapped as if he were trying to win an argument, with repetitive emphasis and terse phrasing designed for maximum impact.

At 7 doing my first bid", "Even though DMX\u2019s time at the top of the genre was relatively brief, just a few ferocious years, he was never erased from its collective memory. That\u2019s partly because the tumult of his personal life constantly landed him in the spotlight \u2014 he was arrested dozens of times, for charges including drug possession, aggravated assault, driving without a license and tax evasion. He rescued stray dogs, and tattooed a tribute to one of his dogs, Boomer, across the whole of his back, but also pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges.", "But he remained a subject of sympathy: DMX was a wild man, and a broken one, too. Physically abused by his mother as a child, he spent significant stretches of time in group homes. He took to crime young, specializing in robbery.
