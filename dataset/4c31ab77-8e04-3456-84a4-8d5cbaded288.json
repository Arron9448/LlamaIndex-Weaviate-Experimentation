One was a seat that Republicans had blocked Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, from filling. Despite arguing in 2016 that the seat should be filled by winner of the year\u2019s presidential election, Republicans rushed to fill the supreme court seat vacated by death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg just weeks before the 2020 election.", "The result was one of the most ideologically conservative courts in modern times.", "Biden\u2019s executive order directs the commission to complete its report within 180 days of its first meeting.
