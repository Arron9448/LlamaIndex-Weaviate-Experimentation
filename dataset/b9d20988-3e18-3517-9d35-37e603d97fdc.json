The video shows that players still have the freedom to take out targets in any manner they see fit. Whether that involves dropping a hapless guard over a cliff or strutting a Paris runway, Hitman\u2019s zany antics should feel even more absurd as the person actively doing it.", "We recently sat down with IO to discuss the process and reasoning behind bringing the Hitman to VR. The studio discussed how the experience brings out a player\u2019s personality in ways standard Hitman does not, and adds a greater emotional impact to assassinations (especially against civilians). It\u2019s a fascinating read for those interested in this new perspective for Agent 47.", "Hitman 3 launches January 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. Hitman 3 is also our cover story for January, so be sure to head over to our coverage hub filled with exclusive content such as our humorous rapid-fire interview with IO and the developer\u2019s thoughts on leaving the Hitman franchise behind."], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "Marcus Is An Avid Gamer", "Giant Wrestling Nerd", "A Connoisseur Of Cartoons", "Obscure Childhood References.
