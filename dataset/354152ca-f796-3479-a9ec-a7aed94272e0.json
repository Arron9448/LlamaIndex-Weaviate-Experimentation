From sunsets and oceans to weddings and parades, to celebrities and hawks and close to a dozen other things.", "But all of that changed one day\u2014the day a tiny button appeared on my phone inviting me to turn the camera lens around. The day the world surrounding me vanished, and all that remained was my own face.", "I looked directly at my face, and I liked what I was seeing. I liked it very much. And I intended to see a whole lot more of it. In that moment, I surrendered to my face\u2019s gaze, and knew that I\u2019d never take a picture of a hawk again, unless that hawk had my face on its body. Then I\u2019d kinda have to.", "I began to laugh at oceans for how ugly they suddenly looked. I spat in the direction of sunsets; tripped the tuba players in parades; walked past celebrities as if they\u2019d never done a single famous thing in their miserable lives. Even weddings became a laughingstock to me. \u201cNice ceremony, idiots!\u201d I\u2019d shout, while snapping a picture of, you guessed it, my face.", "Turns out, I\u2019m the star of the show, and if there are things you want to see besides me you\u2019re going to have to get past my face first. Eiffel Tower? Sure, right behind my face. My friend Susan? Yep, she\u2019s here, pressed up against the cheek of my face. Big Five in Tanzania? Make that the big ten\u2014lion, my face, leopard, my face, rhino, my face, elephant, my face, buffalo, my face. Fireworks on the Fourth of July? More like fireworks on the fourth of my face.", "If a humpback whale breaches at sea and my face isn\u2019t in the picture of it, it\u2019s nothing but a big dumb fish screwing around in the ocean, doing something that may or may not be majestic, and you\u2019ll never know which without my face to tell you.", "If my niece graduates from college and my face isn\u2019t next to hers making a proud expression, did she accomplish anything, or did she just blow two-hundred grand?", "If I take a photo of Morgan Freeman without me in it, will you know that I\u2019m at Madame Tussaud\u2019s and that he\u2019s made of wax? Maybe. But what about John Travolta?", "My face is like a visual diary of my face\u2014each expression providing a moment-to-moment look at the breadth of emotions I\u2019m feeling facially. In one photo, I might be puckering up, looking flirtatious. In another, I\u2019m puckering up and sleepy. In yet another, maybe I\u2019m puckering up and eating lentil soup, or at a memorial, puckered up, looking sad and worried that there\u2019s something very wrong with my lips.", "As much as I hate to admit it, there are moments when even I grow disinterested in my face and feel compelled to hit that little button again, to see what\u2019s on the other side of the lens. It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that not a single one of those things looks even remotely like my face.", "It\u2019s a wake-up call. One that makes me feel lucky to be living in a society that has evolved to finally recognize that the world around us is less interesting than our faces. A society that understands that when people want to make a positive impact on humanity, they should take a good look in the mirror first, because that\u2019s a great way to take a cool face photo."]}
