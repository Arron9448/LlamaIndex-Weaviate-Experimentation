Many urban hotels aim for cult status with locals. This one delivered precisely because it didn\u2019t\u2014and still doesn\u2019t\u2014feel like a hotel. The lobby, with its terrazzo floor, functions more like a giant caf\u00e9, with sober red velvet banquettes, bentwood chairs, and really good espresso and natural wine. Near the front door, bathed in daylight (when there is any in Paris), is an oversized deep-brown marble table surrounded by mismatched vintage chairs that say, I\u2019m good for meetings if you must. Or for cruising the branding consultants and graphic designers squeaking past in interesting sneakers if you like. \u201cWe wanted people to come in and say, \u2018Wait, there are rooms upstairs?\u2019 \u201d says Hugo Sauzay, 34, one half of Festen, the interior design team that gave Le Pigalle the feeling that it had always been there, even when the marble bar was still brand-new. Some of the hotel\u2019s creative team said, \u201c \u2018No, the bar should be shiny\u2019,\u201d Sauzay recalls, \u201cbut Val\u00e9ry Gr\u00e9go, the owner, got what we were doing and said, \u2018Let it stain.\u2019 It gives it a history.\u201d", "Sauzay\u2019s partner is Charlotte de Tonnac, also 34, whom he met at Paris\u2019s \u00c9cole Camondo design school. There they ignored each other for four years only to couple up in the fifth, though they had slightly parallel lives, as they explain at their Marais office, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from their shared apartment. Both were scouted to work as models as teenagers and used the money to pay for school, though de Tonnac, who grew up living all over France thanks to her father, a commercial director of a company that made car motors, grew disenchanted with the profession sooner than Sauzay. \u201cI think I liked chocolates too much,\u201d she says, laughing. But mostly she was bored. Not so for Sauzay, who had gotten on a plane only once before he started figuring in photo shoots and who still occasionally steps in front of the camera. \u201cSuddenly I\u2019d be in Japan or New York the next day, and I became curious and learned to adapt to new situations quickly and instinctively,\u201d he says. \u201cI developed an eye for things, like the Anglo-Saxon way of doing really shiny paint, or how Japanese lacquer mixes with light.\u201d Working as a fit model for Miuccia Prada, Sauzay paid attention to how collections got off the ground and continued to develop his eye for detail. He admits this can get a bit obsessive: Watching movies at home has become an exercise in generosity for de Tonnac. \u201cWe have watched There Will Be Blood so many times,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cEvery three seconds I pause it and take a screenshot,\u201d Sauzay admits. Another favorite is Steven Soderbergh\u2019s series with Clive Owen, The Knick, set in Victorian New York, with its magnificent butt-joint tiles and opium dens. But Sauzay admits it can be anything: a Ben Stiller comedy, something with Bill Murray, pre\u2013Wes Anderson. \u201cI can watch a whole movie and never pay attention to the actors,\u201d he says.", "De Tonnac on a sofa of Festen\u2019s own design. Sauzay sketches from the coffee table. Photographed by Jonas Unger, Vogue, April 2021", "\u201cI need visual calm to work,\u201d says Sauzay. \u201cWhen there\u2019s too much chaos, my eyes sort of chase everything around\u201d", "Knowing when to let a landmark building, or existing treasures, speak as loudly as your own work is a skill not many designers have mastered, especially young ones, and especially in our thirsty Instagram age, where every faucet is brass and every print tells a story and every paint color is boldly arresting, usually all at once. \u201cWe live in l\u2019air du temps, but you have to keep your distance,\u201d de Tonnac says. \u201cWe do mood boards for projects, and we have to be careful with Pinterest and Instagram. You see the same aesthetic all the time. We want a place to hang on 10 to 15 years at least.\u201d Sauzay adds, \u201cWe\u2019re afraid of the fashion effect on spaces. It can be two or three years before something we design sees the light.\u201d It might look great at first, but if it\u2019s too influenced by the color of the moment, \u201cit\u2019s already a has-been when it opens.\u201d", "\u201cThey have a culture of interior design that\u2019s really French,\u201d says Franck Durand, the art director spearheading a new five-star hotel near the Palais Royal, Ch\u00e2teau Voltaire, where Festen is doing the interiors. \u201cThey can handle classics with a lot of detachment.\u201d The hotel\u2019s walls will be lime plaster, complemented by ivory-painted wainscoting and recuperated old Burgundy stone tiles on the floors. Rather than varnish the oak furniture that will appear throughout, they\u2019ll wax it, lending a subtle sheen to the natural grain and, like Le Pigalle\u2019s marble, allowing traces of use as the years wear on. \u201cWe don\u2019t want everything to be custom and perfect\u2014it\u2019s too cold,\u201d Sauzay says.", "Learning how to accommodate historic spaces elegantly is one hallmark of the best of old-country design\u2014Jacques Grange and Axel Vervoordt come immediately to mind, two masters of restrained eclecticism who, it turns out, are North Stars to Festen. \u201cWe love to add our one little thing, even though we know a building will one day become something else,\u201d says de Tonnac."], "authors": ["Alexandra Marshall", "Alexandra Marshal"], "keywords": ["festen", "tonnac", "lowkey", "design", "sauzay", "really", "doing", "chic", "le", "perfecting", "work", "hotels", "duo", "marble", "parisian"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
