Here's How to Not Get Sick", "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d", "pubDate": null, "paragraphs": ["There\u2019s a cruel irony in the fact that holiday travel tends to coincide with the rise of flu season. Yet more than 47 million Americans are preparing to sit for hours inside a tube in the sky, perhaps near someone with a hacking cough. It sounds like the perfect (infectious) storm.", "But reaching your destination without collecting microbial stowaways isn\u2019t as daunting as it seems. The science of infection transmission provides some answers about what\u2019s apt to make you sick, what isn\u2019t, and how to protect yourself.", "The first thing you should know: The hazard isn\u2019t where you might suspect it is. Mingling in the airport with hordes of travelers\u2014grabbing empty bins in security, touching hand rails on escalators, ordering food at counters, and sitting near the gates\u2014is far riskier than breathing air near someone you hear sneezing or coughing a few rows away.", "Airplanes have been designed to pump fresh, filtered air through the cabin ever since the days when smoking was allowed on board. (Otherwise all those planes would have been worse than the smokiest dive bar.) Commercial jets pull in half their cabin air from the high-altitude environment, where it is cold and sterile, while the rest of it is cabin air recirculated through HEPA filters.", "Air exchanges occur 10 to 15 times an hour, and the air flows laterally across the row, not from the front of the plane to the rear. Because of the way the air loops, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigates potential infectious transmission on a plane, public health officers generally contact passengers in a zone just two rows in front of and behind the sick passenger.", "Even a two-row buffer probably inflates the risk for most respiratory diseases, says Vicki Hertzberg, a biostatistician at Emory University\u2019s School of Nursing who has studied the issue. \u201cThe air in an airplane these days is even better than what\u2019s in your average office building,\u201d she says.", "With the help of a team of graduate students, Hertzberg took samples of the air and various surfaces on 10 cross-country flights and observed the movement of passengers during the flight. None of the samples tested positive for any of 18 common respiratory viruses, including influenza.", "Travel itself can make you feel run-down, at no fault of your fellow passengers. \u201cWhen people say they feel ill when they\u2019re on an airplane\u2014with a scratchy throat\u2014it\u2019s generally from the super dryness of the air,\u201d says Petra Illig, an emergency medicine doctor and aviation medical examiner based in Anchorage. \u201cThe longer the flight is, the drier that air gets, unless you\u2019re on one of the very modern 787s and Airbuses where they have a humidifier going.\u201d Drinking water won\u2019t keep you from feeling the effects of the dry air. Some hand lotion and saline eye drops can help, Illig says.", "So, what about that coughing passenger? When people are sick with influenza or various cold viruses, they emit infectious droplets, which tend to drift to the floor rather than linger in the air, and then get sucked into the ventilation system. Still, when Hertzberg flies, she tries to stick with the window seat. You only breathe in infectious droplets from someone who is close to you, and the window seat places you in the most protected space.", "Another bit of advice: \u201cIf the person beside you is sick, do not turn your air nozzle on,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they\u2019re sneezing, whatever they\u2019re sneezing gets caught in that air stream that\u2019s coming down from the nozzle.\u201d In other words, it will circulate around your seat. Instead, she suggests, kindly ask them to turn their own nozzle on."], "keywords": ["near", "nozzle", "passengers", "infectious", "sneezing", "isnt", "theyre", "heres", "traveling", "holidays", "air", "sick", "seat"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Michele Cohen Maril"], "summary": "There\u2019s a cruel irony in the fact that holiday travel tends to coincide with the rise of flu season.\nThe science of infection transmission provides some answers about what\u2019s apt to make you sick, what isn\u2019t, and how to protect yourself.\nAirplanes have been designed to pump fresh, filtered air through the cabin ever since the days when smoking was allowed on board.\nAnother bit of advice: \u201cIf the person beside you is sick, do not turn your air nozzle on,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re sneezing, whatever they\u2019re sneezing gets caught in that air stream that\u2019s coming down from the nozzle.\u201d In other words, it will circulate around your seat."}
