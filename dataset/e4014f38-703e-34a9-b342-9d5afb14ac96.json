For his latest tome, his gaze shifts to Queen Elizabeth, her younger sister Princess Margaret, and their sometimes-fraught relationship in Elizabeth and Margaret: The Intimate World of the Windsor Sisters, out March 30. According to the book, young Elizabeth once told her governess that \u201cMargaret always wants what I\u2019ve got.\u201d And Margaret, in her fifties, once remarked that she was \u201cstill playing second best after all these years, I guess I\u2019ll be second best to my grave.\u201d", "The book delves deep into the sisters\u2019 incredibly close but often tense bond while also bringing top of mind the complicated \u201cheir and spare\u201d sibling dynamic that, up to the present day with Prince William and Prince Harry, has played out over and over again in the press. \u201cBoth sisters were universally known and almost constantly surrounded by people, yet in so many ways they remained indecipherable to everyone but each other,\u201d Morton writes. \u201cIt was from this position of magnificent isolation that the sisters formed their inseparable, intuitive bond.\u201d", "Here, Morton unpacks the sisters\u2019 relationship, while also considering what Diana would think of the family today, and which royal he would take to tea (it\u2019s not who you think).", "Your book examines the lives of and the relationship between Elizabeth and Margaret. Describe the dynamic of the sisters\u2019 relationship pre-abdication and, once the abdication happened in 1936\u2013when Elizabeth was 10 and Margaret was only six\u2013how it changed.", "Andrew Morton: They were treated just alike\u2013same socks, same skirts\u2013and in that way, Elizabeth was brought down to Margaret\u2019s level, because there\u2019s a four-year age difference. They were twins. There were two princesses; there was no possibility in the minds of many, including the Duke and Duchess of York, that the Duke would ever become king, and that his daughter would ever become queen. They lived in the shadows of Uncle David, the Prince of Wales, a charismatic figure. When he abdicated in December 1936, it was an incredible blow and transformed the lives of Elizabeth and Margaret as importantly as their parents. The dynamic changed; Elizabeth was treated as the heir presumptive and, as such, she had a slightly different education, much to Margaret\u2019s chagrin, as she went down a slightly different path. Instead of being treated like twins, they were treated separately and educated separately, and their lives began to diverge."], "authors": ["Rachel Burchfield", "Rachel Burchfiel"], "keywords": ["lives", "sisters", "prince", "sibling", "margaret", "relationship", "dynamic", "royal", "morton", "complicated", "elizabeth", "treated", "relationships", "book"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
