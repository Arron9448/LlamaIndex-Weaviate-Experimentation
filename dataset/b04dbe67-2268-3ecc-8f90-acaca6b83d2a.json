This was a devastating defeat, inflicted at the very end of a game in which they never quite did enough. The number of chances to escape relegation are dwindling rapidly and, having hauled their way back into contention earlier in the spring, they have picked the worst possible time to offset much of that good work by equalling their worst losing run of the season.", "A fourth consecutive reverse was guaranteed in thrilling fashion by Adama Traor\u00e9 in the second minute of added time. If the goal was unexpected for its timing then its quality of conception and execution were both startling, too, given the drudgery of what had previously passed. Wolves did not stand out here but felt they had their just deserts: Willian Jos\u00e9 had seen what looked a legitimate opener ruled out shortly before half-time by a ludicrous application of VAR and until those final seconds it seemed their sense of injustice would rankle all the way home.", "Instead they could celebrate a first win in six. The game had rarely opened up until a relatively helter-skelter closing spell in which Fulham, their urgency growing, threw men forward. Wolves were finding gaps of their own and found the critical sliver of space when their substitute, Fabio Silva, flipped a smart first-time pass through the inside-right channel for Traor\u00e9 to run through. The finish, hammered past Alphonse Areola with tremendous force from an angle, was emphatic and gave Traor\u00e9 his first Premier League goal since December 2019.", "Given the threat he poses, even on relatively quiet nights like this, that barren 48-game run seemed jarring. \u201cAdama can produce amazing scenes,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, his manager. \u201cHis talent, his speed, his style, the way he works: he deserves moments like this because he works for them.\u201d Had Traor\u00e9 not intervened, Nuno\u2019s conversation might not have strayed beyond the injustice served up by video technology. When Jos\u00e9 thundered in an excellent header from Daniel Podence\u2019s chipped cross, the centre-forward appeared to have broken the 11-game drought he has endured since joining from Real Sociedad in January.", "Wolves\u2019 Willian Jos\u00e9 had a goal ruled out just before half-time. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Wolves/Getty Images", "There was no reason to suspect otherwise unless you were in control of Stockley Park\u2019s soul-sapping selection of lines and graphs. They were pulled up to discern Podence had strayed offside, apparently by the width of half a shoulder, before delivering. It seemed unclear even after several replays and once again the question rears up: is this the sport we really want? Nuno thought not.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not the spirit of the game so I hope that us in football can find a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen stadiums are full again it\u2019s going to be hard to explain to thousands and thousands of people that one hand is an offside.\u201d", "It was a reprieve for Fulham and looked likely to ensure they earned a point, although that may not have made too much difference in the scheme of things. Ruben Loftus-Cheek should have put them ahead shortly before the half-hour but flashed a header wide when unmarked 12 yards out. The provider was Antonee Robinson, who was perhaps the game\u2019s best player from his perch as an advanced left wing-back and also teed up a half-chance that Aleksandar Mitrovic planted off target.", "Fulham\u2019s problem was that, even as they ratcheted up the late pressure, they lacked anyone with similar attacking gumption. Ademola Lookman, sidelined with a hamstring injury, was badly missed.", "\u201cWe\u2019re deflated, we\u2019re hurt,\u201d said Scott Parker, some of whose players appeared close to tears at full time. \u201cYou can see the scenes at the end, how desperate this team are to be successful. I asked the team to leave everything on the pitch and tonight we did that. Sometimes when you get put to the canvas the real character of someone is to get back up, and we\u2019re going to need to do that.\u201d", "The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.", "They are, and given visits to Arsenal and Chelsea come next they will have to find hope the difficult way while praying Newcastle waste their games in hand. For all that balls bobbled around the Wolves box they rarely worked Rui Patr\u00edcio; the visitors, for their part, created little but Jos\u00e9 could have scored in the second minute and Traor\u00e9 dragged wide from a serviceable position after that.", "\u201cMy team did everything tonight, nullified a very good team and tried their hardest to win the game,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis team will come back fighting.\u201d The sense is that it will take quite something, though, for them to recover from Traor\u00e9\u2019s knockout blow."], "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "keywords": ["run", "late", "traor\u00e9", "fulham", "team", "goal", "trouble", "leaves", "game", "winner", "big", "worst", "jos\u00e9", "adama", "relegation", "way", "traor\u00e9s", "wolves"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
