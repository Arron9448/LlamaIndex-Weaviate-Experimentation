Her groundbreaking portrayals of complex, dignified Black women in feature films like \u2018\u2018Sounder\u2019\u2019 (1972) and the 1974 television film \u2018\u2018The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\u2019\u2019 showed aspects of the American experience that had rarely, if ever, been represented onscreen before. The gravitas and artistry that Tyson brought to those projects has been a constant throughout her long career, up through the actress\u2019s Tony Award-winning turn in \u2018\u2018The Trip to Bountiful\u2019\u2019 (2013) and ABC\u2019s just-concluded legal drama series \u2018\u2018How to Get Away With Murder,\u2019\u2019 for which she earned five Emmy nominations. Now, with her memoir, \u2018\u2018Just as I Am,\u2019\u2019 which will be published on Jan. 26, Tyson, who is 96, has moved from telling her characters\u2019 stories to telling her own. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m always searching for myself,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so many facets to a human being. I surprise myself all the time.\u2019\u2019", "You\u2019re 96 years old. You\u2019ve had a full life. What advice do you have about how to do that? Oh, I don\u2019t know that I can say it now. Maybe at the end of the interview.", "A cliffhanger! That\u2019s right. It makes sure you stay with me.", "I like it. Let me ask a question that has to do with race and acting. You remember Pauline Kael? Yes. She gave me an excellent review for \u2018\u2018Sounder.\u2019\u2019", "Cicely Tyson in \u201cSounder\u201d (1972). Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation/Photofest", "She also had an essay about \u2018\u2018Jane Pittman,\u2019\u2019 and I want to read you something from it. She wrote: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m comparing Tyson to the highest, because that\u2019s the comparison she invites and has earned. She isn\u2019t there, but she\u2019s on her way. She\u2019s great, but she will be even greater when she can relax and smile without feeling she\u2019s Uncle Tomming.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s a pretty big, fraught assumption Kael was making, that you were playing to racial perceptions. What do you think about that? That\u2019s a surprise! I don\u2019t Uncle Tom to anybody. I don\u2019t care who it is. When I smile, I smile. I do not grin. There\u2019s a difference, OK? And I would say that to Jesus, do you understand? White people always think that when Black people smile a lot or laugh a lot, they\u2019re being Uncle Tom to white folks. Well, that is not me. Absolutely not me. I smile when I feel like smiling, and I don\u2019t when I do not.", "But what about Kael\u2019s fundamental assumption? That your characterizations were informed by off-the-screen racial dynamics. Did you ever approach your work on those terms? No. I never worried about what people think about my performances. I work internally, and then when I\u2019m not working on a character, I don\u2019t think about them at all.", "Tyson with Michael Murphy in \u2018\u2018The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\u2019\u2019 (1974). Everett Collection", "In your book, you write about some problematic people who were in your life. One is Bill Cosby, with whom you were close. But in the book, you don\u2019t mention what has happened with him over the past few years or how you feel about it. Are you comfortable sharing your perspective on that? I think about it all the time. To tell you the truth, I can\u2019t believe it. We were close. Miles and I were married in his home, you know? It\u2019s hard for me to talk about, because I don\u2019t know this person that is incarcerated and I never experienced anything that resembled the behavior that he is incarcerated for. I don\u2019t know that person of whom they speak.", "What does it say about human nature that this person you were close to had this other side? That you don\u2019t know anybody. You think you know them, but you don\u2019t. I mean, that a person could have a personality so far removed from the one that you know? How can you account for it? You can\u2019t.", "I also want to ask you about Miles Davis. Who\u2019s that? [Laughs]", "The portrait that you paint of him in the book is pretty unsparing. In your telling, he was physically abusive, he was unfaithful, he was dishonest and he was also dealing with serious addiction problems. Was it hard to disclose those experiences? No. That\u2019s who he was. I have never seen Miles Davis smoke reefer, snort cocaine or hit a woman, OK? He never did it in front of me. He never brought any of those things into our home, all right? And when I tell people that, they say, \u2018\u2018That\u2019s because of his respect for you.\u2019\u2019", "Tyson and Miles Davis in New York City in 1968. Ron Galella Ltd./Ron Galella Collection, via Getty Images", "I don\u2019t quite understand. In the book, you write about him punching you in the chest. Oh, that was the only time he ever hit me, and that was at the beginning of our relationship. I was shocked. Some people came to the house, a famous writer and his wife, and something happened. I had prepared lunch and \u2014", "You dropped a knife on the floor. Yes, and he thought I threw the knife on the floor because of something he said. I hadn\u2019t even been listening to what he was saying. And he came to me, yes he did, and he punched me in the chest. That\u2019s the only time he ever struck me. I\u2019d never had anybody do that to me, all right? He was so sorry. I\u2019m glad you reminded me of that. Those things come and go. The abuse that\u2019s mentioned, I understood where it came from. People don\u2019t behave in that way for no reason. It comes from something or someplace. And nine times out of 10, it\u2019s because they have been deeply hurt. The way people would refer to Miles, \u2018\u2018He\u2019s bad, he\u2019s this, he does that\u2019\u2019 \u2014 not in a vacuum, he doesn\u2019t. Nine times out of 10, the abuse came out when he was under the influence of the drugs, of the alcohol.", "After all that you went through with him, is he someone you still have love for? Listen, let me tell you something. I got to know the soul of a man who is as gentle as a lamb. He covered it up with this ruthless attitude because he was so shy. Shy, you hear me? And in trying to be the kind of tough person that people thought he was, he ruined his life. Yes, gentle as a lamb, you hear me? That\u2019s the Miles Davis I knew.", "But what about love? I\u2019m curious about how your feelings for a man like that might have changed over time. Wait a minute. The man I love was not like that to me. When he was dying, a friend of mine went to the hospital to see him, and he was trying to tell her something. But he had had surgery, and she couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say to her. The nurse came in and said to my friend, \u2018\u2018Why don\u2019t you go for a walk and come back in about 45 minutes, and he will be able to talk to you.\u2019\u2019 So she went for a walk. And she came back to the hospital, and he was able to talk loudly enough to tell her this: \u2018\u2018Tell Cicely I\u2019m sorry. Tell her I\u2019m very, very sorry.\u2019\u2019", "Tyson with Stan Shaw in \u201cFried Green Tomatoes\u201d (1991). Universal Pictures/Photofest", "You\u2019ve been in the entertainment business for more than 60 years. What\u2019s the biggest change you\u2019ve seen? There has been an attempt at being more lenient to Blacks. Let me correct that a little. They are hiring Blacks, but they are hiring Black actors from Africa. And the question has been: \u2018\u2018What\u2019s the difference? He\u2019s Black.\u2019\u2019 Ah, but he\u2019s Black African, as opposed to Black American. They\u2019re taking away our jobs.", "Are there examples you\u2019re thinking of? If you take a look at the scene and the Black actors whose careers have come to fruition in the last few years, you will see that most of the Black male actors have been from Africa. Black males here have been quite upset about it. Do you follow?", "I follow. I\u2019m not sure I agree, but I follow.

They just think they know death because other people say it is something to be scared of, but they don\u2019t know that it is a frightening thing. Do you?", "Nope. No, you don\u2019t know what it is.
