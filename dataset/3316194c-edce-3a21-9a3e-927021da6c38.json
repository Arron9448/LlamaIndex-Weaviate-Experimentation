To show off the scale of the ship form, this toy comes with a tiny Optimus Prime Autobot figure.", "The next reveal was for a new Commander Class Rodimus Prime, which comes with the Matrix of Leadership. The vehicle form comes with a huge trailer that has several hidden compartments for accessories. A Leader Class Galvatron was also shown, and he also has the Matrix of Leadership, not in his chest, but hung around his neck on a chain.

Sitting in front of them was a sizable Optimus Prime in vehicle form. When Jason Mewes said \"convert,\" Prime began transforming into robot form. The familiar transformation sound rang out as Optimus Prime quickly unfolded and stood on his own! It was an impressive thing to see, and both the robot and vehicle forms look fairly good, though some changes had to made to simplify the transformation process for automation.", "While standing, Prime can move in a variety of ways, such as pointing an arm forward, turning his head, and even walking. Prime can pose in triumphant ways, swing his energy axe, and can even be programmed using an app to do what you ask. Prime features 25 different voice commands.
