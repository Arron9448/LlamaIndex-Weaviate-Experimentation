An animal rights organisation said the footage was taken by a whistleblower who worked at the facility between 2018 and 2020. It appears to show animals housed in barren conditions, being taunted, smacked and shaken, and cut into with no or inadequate anaesthesia.", "The footage, published by Cruelty Free International (CFI), appears to show technicians shaking and swinging rats vigorously to stun them into submission prior to dosing.", "Scissors were shown being used to decapitate young rodents. Rabbits were seen struggling in their restraint devices, falling and suffering injuries. Dogs are shown being picked up by the scruff of the neck and thrown into boxes or cages.", "Vivotecnia CEO Andres K\u00f6nig categorically denied that there was a culture of abuse of animals used in experiments at Vivotecnia. \u201cWe work at all times to guarantee the quality of our work, always taking into account animal welfare,\u201d he said in a statement sent to the Guardian.", "Some of the most graphic instances of cruelty include fully conscious rats having blood drawn out of their eyes \u2013 which CFI described as a usually \u201cterminal\u201d procedure meant to be conducted under anaesthesia. In another incident, a senior member of staff is seen drawing a \u201cface\u201d on the genitals of a male monkey who was pinned to the table while another staff member practised collecting blood from the animal\u2019s leg.", "According to CFI, animals were also not always monitored \u2013 staff worked 8am\u20135pm on weekdays, and fewer hours at the weekend \u2013 and this led to the death of several animals. CFI said the whistleblower reported their concerns to senior staff but no action was taken.", "The footage appears to show practices in contravention of Spanish and EU law \u2013 directive 2010/63 \u2013 that, among other things, mandates suffering in animals used in experiments be kept to a minimum, added CFI, which is campaigning for the closure of the facility and an overhaul of animal experimentation laws.", "Veterinarian Joan Antoni Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco, who works with the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, said he was surprised to hear of the allegations. \u201cI don\u2019t know of this specific case, but I would say that it is something really strange.\u201d", "In Spain, any experimentation involving animals must be approved by an ethics committee, which often includes vets and researchers who specialise in working with laboratory animals. Legislation also sets out that all personnel working with animals for scientific purposes must have \u201cadequate prior training\u201d.", "Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco contrasted allegations that the laboratory had at times carried out procedures without adequate anaesthesia with the requirement to minimise suffering. The animals must always be monitored, he said, and, if necessary, \u201cyou have to euthanise them if you consider they are suffering too much and they cannot be included in the procedure any more\u201d.", "He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not justifiable to allow a live animal to suffer and not take any kind of measure.\u201d", "Once an animal\u2019s physiology is altered due to stress, any testing data collected on that animal is essentially unreliable \u2013 ultimately it is in the best interest of the researchers to ensure the highest standard of animal welfare or risk \u201cusing a lot of animals for nothing\u201d, he said.", "", "In a statement, CFI\u2019s director of science and regulatory affairs, Dr Katy Taylor, said: \u201cThis footage shows yet again the dark side of regulatory toxicity testing on animals. The European commission tells us that directive 2010/63 not only protects animals used in science but that it also provides a strategy to replace animal testing. It does neither.", "", "\u201cThere are various examples of where the procedures were done so badly or the handling was so bad that they\u2019ve breached directives, but \u2026 also we do have instances of gratuitous cruelty and abuse.\u201d", "Cruelty Free International is campaigning for the closure of the facility and an overhaul of animal experimentation laws. Photograph: Cruelty Free International", "CFI has uncovered similar breaches of laws elsewhere in Europe, most recently at a facility in Germany.", "Facilities such as Vivotecnia that use non-human primates are meant to be inspected at least once a year, including announced visits. K\u00f6nig said Vivotecnia has been audited annually and its facilities and processes additionally audited every six months. The facility has worked on projects funded by EU and Spanish authorities.", "\u201cThere\u2019s clearly an issue with facilities not being inspected frequently enough in Spain and this is a good example of why there need to be more inspections,\u201d Taylor said.", "\u201cThis is building a very strong picture that there\u2019s something fundamentally very wrong with animal experiments in Europe.\u201d", "In its statement to the Guardian, K\u00f6nig said: \u201cWe would like to stress that at Vivotecnia Research animal welfare is a fundamental priority. The working procedures at Vivotecnia adhere to the European Union directive (2010/63/EU) for the protection of experimental animals, as well as to the royal decree RD 53/2013 establishing the basic rules that are applicable for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.", "\u201cAll our technical staff are trained according to the ministerial order ECC/566/2015, we have processes and protocols to control compliance with the internal code of conduct, which is monitored through a chain of command, the quality assurance unit, our designated veterinarians and the ethics committee, as well as by audits from clients and the authorities.\u201d", "April 8 update: Shortly after viewing the footage, the regional government of Madrid, the authority responsible for overseeing the laboratory, confirmed it had begun a process to inspect the facility.", "Sign up here for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.
