By Olivia Sudjic. Bloomsbury; 272 pages; \u00a314.99.", "W HEN OLIVIA SUDJIC\u2019S debut novel, \u201cSympathy\u201d, a study of a young woman\u2019s obsession with social media, was published in 2017 it was hailed as \u201cthe first great Instagram novel\u201d; she followed it with \u201cExposure\u201d, an extended essay about the internet, impostor syndrome and the withering self-consciousness of twenty-somethings. Aspects of both works creep into Ms Sudjic\u2019s haunting and haunted second novel, \u201cAsylum Road\u201d, but its scope is broader and its artistic grip more certain.", "Anya, the narrator for most of the story, is working desultorily on a P h D thesis in art history. At first her world seems prosaically upper-middle class: she lives in London with her boyfriend, Luke, a bioscientist, in a flat bought by his parents, and is about to go on holiday in the south of France. Yet already something is askew. The couple share a fascination with true-crime podcasts, and the book opens with a startling sentence that will resonate: \u201cSometimes it felt like the murders kept us together.\u201d", "Amid a vague mood of menace and coercion, the pair become engaged. Anya, though, is a bag of nerves masquerading as a functioning adult. She fakes emotions, picks at her face and is disgusted by her body. Her breasts, for example, are alternately described as \u201cwhite meat\u201d and \u201ctwo live creatures\u201d. In fragmented psychological prose, Ms Sudjic stealthily plants clues to her ultimate subject\u2014the trauma inflicted by Anya\u2019s childhood in Sarajevo, the dislocations of the Bosnian war, severance from her parents and a relative\u2019s suicide.", "When, disastrously, the couple travel to Sarajevo together, deep, unhealed scars begin to open. The mind of Anya\u2019s mother is stuck in a city under siege. Half-submerged memories resurface in sharp, violent imagery: in a hotel room, \u201ca line of moth holes in the heavy curtain shone white-hot like bullet holes\u201d. The characters narrowly escape death on a lethally winding road.", "The author switches briefly to third-person narration as both plot and protagonist unravel. Anya revisits other parts of her past: her university years; a cousin who once forced her to take part in a deer hunt, a scene infused, like others, with echoes of previous bloodshed. As Anya moves to the Asylum Road of the title, Ms Sudjic coolly executes a climax as treacherous and unexpected as a hairpin bend. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["asylum", "novel", "tale", "road", "twisty", "lane", "parents", "olivia", "memory", "sudjic", "anya", "trauma", "sarajevo", "sudjics", "ms"], "pubDate": "2021-01-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
