There, in the window, was a framed Times article making exactly this assertion. \u201cThe big secret in Chinese food these days is right out in the open,\u201d wrote Eric Asimov. \u201cIt\u2019s Chinatown\u2014Manhattan Chinatown\u2014where the food . . . is as good or better than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d It was published in 2003.", "Many of Chinatown\u2019s beloved culinary institutions have closed; newcomers like Green Garden Village feel more than capable of maintaining the area\u2019s character and spirit.

Many of Chinatown\u2019s beloved culinary institutions have closed; these newcomers feel more than capable of maintaining the area\u2019s character and spirit. (A third place, even newer, called Hak Box, is expressly trying to re-create dishes served at a long-departed neighborhood haunt.)", "Much of what\u2019s worth ordering at Green Garden Village is on display as you enter. On the right, there are tanks of live seafood; on the left, a hanging menagerie of barbecue, including glistening ducks, chickens, and whole pigs. For diners who don\u2019t read Chinese, the rest of the dense and imperfectly translated menu can be a little difficult to navigate, but patient, helpful servers are receptive to the universal language of pointing to what other, more confident-seeming people are eating.", "Tightly packed clouds of ground shrimp and pork emerge from slippery squares of fresh tofu. Photograph by An Rong Xu for The New Yorker", "When I learned that the Alaskan king crab on a neighboring lazy Susan was priced at thirty-eight dollars a pound and weighed about eight, I demurred. I opted, instead, for a broad range of less expensive dishes\u2014though not without some regret, as I watched the procession of diverse preparations of the single crustacean\u2019s various parts: legs steamed with garlic, scallions, and cilantro; carapace used as a bowl for silky custard.", "More palatably priced Dungeness crabs and lobsters are only big enough for one dish apiece, but there are options: they can be hacked up, battered, and deep-fried, for example, so that every chunk wears a beautifully golden, oily, salty coat of armor, finished with red-pepper flakes and shallot and protecting the sweet flesh within; or hacked up and stir-fried, Guangdong style, with scrambled egg, black beans, celery, and ground pork.", "Cantonese barbecue is especially good at lunch; the meat is sliced and fanned over rice with a condiment made from ginger, garlic, and scallion, minced in oil. Photograph by An Rong Xu for The New Yorker", "These make excellent centerpieces for a banquet beginning, perhaps, with a steaming bowl of West Lake soup, its surface wispy with egg white, bits of ground beef and bright scallion bobbing beneath, comfortingly gelatinous and mild but for an optional sprinkling of riotously pink red-rice vinegar. Snow-pea leaves, poached in chicken-and-pork broth, come topped with wedges of hard-boiled egg, thousand-year egg, and salted duck egg. Chewy fried rice flecked with nubs of preserved pork and Chinese broccoli gets a subtle crunch from the thick flakes of salt in which the meat was cured. Tightly packed clouds of ground shrimp and pork emerge from slippery blocks of fresh tofu.", "Live seafood, including lobsters, can be selected from tanks and prepared in a variety of ways, including Guangdong style: stir-fried with egg, fermented black bean, and ground pork. Photograph by An Rong Xu for The New Yorker", "The barbecue is especially satisfying at lunch, when the tables closest to the door become a de-facto cafeteria, shared by solo diners feasting with focus on slices of duck, soy-sauce chicken, or char siu, fanned atop rice with the traditional dollop of oily minced garlic, scallion, and ginger. At breakfast, a bowl of congee, thick with squid, char siu, and translucent curls of pork rind and topped with peanuts, is so hearty it will leave you with room for little else, which is just as well\u2014the dim sum is better elsewhere. But you don\u2019t have to go far. (Dishes $7-$40.) \u2666"]}
