Courtesy of Deborah Kaplan", "Rewatching the movie for the first time in 15 years this summer, I was struck by just how important the clothing choices were to the plot. They come from Fiona\u2019s lair: a stark, underground facility where frenzied forecasters run around saying things like, \u201cFeathered tank top, matching pants, kind of a Buffy meets chicken run,\u201d and \u201cThe new word for cool will be jerking.\u201d As soon as this command center declares a trend, you start to see it in the costuming.", "Just one year into the decade, Evans summed up the aesthetic of the early aughts so well. She knew she couldn\u2019t make a movie with up-to-the-minute trends if they would already be old news by the time the movie hit theaters. So she did a bit of forecasting, and realized that fashion was heading in the direction of an opulent \u201970s sexy aesthetic and really low-rise pants.", "Evans looked at images of Halston and Yves Saint Laurent models and muses, then spiced it up with the band\u2019s signature leopard print and plenty of sparkle. \u201cBefore shooting, I met with a couple of different jean companies, and I said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do these low-rise jeans incredibly low rise.\u201d I kept saying, \u201cSmaller, shorter, shorter.\u201d We had to custom-make a lot of the clothes because there was nothing at the time that was low-rise enough,\u201d Evans said. \u201cHonestly, in the film, I probably custom-designed and made about 95% of the clothes.\u201d", "Courtesy of Deborah Kaplan Courtesy of Deborah Kaplan", "Every time I rewatch Josie and the Pussycats, I notice something different in how the clothes signal an internal shift for the characters, or foreshadow a development to come. They almost function like subtitles, adding context to the lavish outrageousness of the plot. There are five main style themes in the film, each centered around a color. The pack moves from pink to orange to blue to purple to animal print. In the beginning, everyone but our heroines are decked out in neon pink to various degrees. There are the obvious fashion victims, like the group of girls who show up at the Pussycat\u2019s gig to mock them. Josie shoots at them,\u201cHey, did you guys all coordinate before you left the house, or are you wearing the same thing by accident?\u201d (Later, these girls show up at the \u2018Cats\u2019 hotel room to fangirl, and are all wearing blue.) By the time the Pussycats arrive at their makeover scene\u2014no 2001 chick flick would be complete without such a montage\u2014the colors have already cycled through orange to blue. The girls exit the John Freida salon wearing purple, which, soon enough, will be the next color du jour."], "authors": ["Sarah Spellings", "Sarah Spelling"], "keywords": ["pussycats", "girls", "y2k", "lowrise", "movies", "soon", "blue", "wearing", "movie", "greatest", "shorter", "josie", "deborah", "fashion"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
