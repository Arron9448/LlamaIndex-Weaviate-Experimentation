My regular mooching about town \u2013 which I did just describe in full here but read it back and thought (about myself, about my own life), \u201cNo, that sounds too pretentious\u201d and so deleted \u2013 was laced with this extra frisson of energy. There was sunshine and a sense of joyfulness in the streets. People were laughing out loud and drinking together and cheersing. It felt exhilarating: like colour was creeping back into the world. From a distance, I noticed a professional photographer taking crowd photos, presumably so newspapers could shame people for legally having fun. Cool, I thought. Very good and cool.", "It\u2019s a weird moment in the lockdown cycles, here: we\u2019re allowed to do things, again, but with \u201cdoing things\u201d comes a fresh new round of \u201cbeing scolded for doing things\u201d, and with \u201cbeing scolded for doing things\u201d comes this meta-scolding where you\u2019re not allowed to express that you don\u2019t like being scolded for doing things because that, in itself, is scolding.

We\u2019ve been so hung up on rules \u2013 both adhering to them, over-adhering to them, and roiling with seething rage when other people don\u2019t adhere to them as strictly as we do \u2013 that as lockdown loosens I worry that we\u2019ll struggle to let go of them all. Some people\u2019s idea of having fun is just having fun: some people\u2019s idea of having fun is getting furious at other people having fun.", "The two worlds struggle to co-exist. Though I don\u2019t subscribe to this, I do understand how it makes a rough sort of sense \u2013 a YouGov survey from last week highlighted the problem quite succinctly. When asked if they would be adhering to new relaxed-but-still-distanced socialising rules, 91% of respondents\u2019 assuredly said they would. When asked if they trusted other people to abide by the same rules, 67% said they didn\u2019t. This is Britain in a statistic. I know how to behave correctly, but I can see from watching you very closely that you do not.", "But I do think this goes a little deeper than the pandemic: essentially, that quite a lot of the country would be comfortable extending lockdown indefinitely if it meant people they didn\u2019t like never got to enjoy themselves again. Extrapolate it out and a lot of people\u2019s lives don\u2019t actually go beyond \u201cstay at home a lot, socialise only when they bump into nearby neighbours while doing the supermarket big shop, order takeaway every Saturday and get too into doing the school run\u201d, and in that sense the pandemic hasn\u2019t wildly changed their lives. Take the commute away and that gives three extra hours in the day to watch The Greatest Showman on Amazon Prime again. Why not keep it like this for everyone forever?", "None of this is new, but lockdown has put it in bold: a new version of puritanism that we\u2019ve been slipping into for a while has been mainstaged by a year of curtain twitching and NHS clap-policing and that Tesco Christmas advert that expressed ironic shock at the idea of not donating to Captain Tom. Of all the things we\u2019ll struggle to shake from this pandemic \u2013 I sneezed on a bus the other day and I think it would have been more socially acceptable if I got a rifle out and fired off a couple of errant shots \u2013 the Neighbourhood Watch-ification of public life will be hardest to cast off. So this week, enjoy whichever of the two vices you ascribe to \u2013 having a beer in the sun, or looking at other people having a beer in the sun and tutting really loudly about it \u2013 because it\u2019ll be a long time until these two warring factions find peace."], "authors": ["Joel Golby"], "keywords": ["struggle", "scolded", "things", "sense", "fun", "rules", "dont", "indulge", "curtaintwitching", "having", "allowed", "doing", "lockdown", "british", "vices"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
