The whimsical design was chosen by Airbus staff following a poll in which 20,000 employees were given six options and asked to choose their favorite.

The enormous cargo bay is large enough to carry two A350 wings at a time (the old Beluga could transport only one), and the whale-like nose improves the craft's aerodynamic efficiency.", "Nature, after all, perfected the beluga whale and, explains Grosse, \"flying in the air is a little bit like swimming in the sea.\"", "l e v a r t", "Pilot training", "So how does one go about steering a machine like this through the skies?

Our pilots will be trained on the A330 and then they will get a Delta qualification to enable them to fly the Beluga XL.\"", "While you might think the aircraft would run slower, \"the drag is about the same,\" says George. \"What changes really is the behavior of the aircraft at the rear, at the bottom of the cargo bay.", "\"This is why we have lifted the vertical tail plane by more than two meters to get it out of the flow behind the cargo bay and we have also the special acceleration on the horizontal tail plane to give stability to the aircraft.\"", "The Beluga XL is powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, which, as with its wings, are also used on the A330.", "Related content Airbus A380: Where to fly in a superjumbo before they go away", "Preparations for a very special guest", "Airbus manufactures its wings in a large factory at Hawarden Airport in the UK.", "The facility has undergone special modifications for the arrival of the Beluga XL, such as creating two sets of doors for the Beluga Line Station -- one to fit the Beluga and one to fit the Beluga XL.", "Airbus also resurfaced the landing strip, erected blast fences (to safely redirect the engines' high-energy exhaust) and installed new turn pads -- necessary for when the Beluga XL turns around on Hawarden's relatively short runway of around 1,600 meters."], "authors": ["Text Maureen O'Hare", "Video Ed Scott-Clarke", "Colin Wallace"], "keywords": ["special", "enters", "long", "beluga", "airbus", "plane", "meters", "cargo", "service", "wings", "aircraft", "xl", "planes"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "fa207f19-e080-3902-982c-393d321776be"}
