It could easily have gone the other way.", "\u201cNo matter what you saw on that tape, this nation does not have a great track record on this subject,\u201d he added. \u201cBut at least in this case, this man faces accountability.\u201d", "Still, \u201cjustice is a far more difficult goal,\u201d the Late Show host continued. \u201cAmerica still has a problem of overpolicing and systemic racism, but hopefully this is a step toward a future where police being held accountable for their actions isn\u2019t headline material and a hope that accountability today is a deterrent for tomorrow.", "\u201cToday is one stop on a journey that began last May and led to protests calling for that accountability in every town and every city in America,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut this is just one stop.
