And yet cases kept falling.", "Was it a form of herd immunity? Were some Indians protected by earlier vaccinations for others viruses? Doctors still are unsure what drove the decline. \u201cThat\u2019s something we don\u2019t really have answer for, we just don\u2019t,\u201d says Dr Shahid Jameel, a virologist and director of the Trivedi school of biosciences at Ashoka University.", "But even in a country with spotty health surveillance, he is confident the fall in caseloads was genuine. \u201cTesting had gone down, but testing had not gone down to such an extent that we wouldn\u2019t be picking the virus up,\u201d he says. \u201cThe curve was declining faster than the number of tests being taken, so it was a real decline.\u201d", "Few were seriously troubled by the relatively small numbers of new cases that continued to be reported in Kerala and Maharashtra, two of the states with the best public-health surveillance in the country, indicating the virus was still out there, circulating.", "Such was the sense of security that when vaccinations were opened in January to health workers, take-up was significantly slower than expected. And what was the rush? Virus cases fell to 10,000 per day at one stage. Senior Indian government figures were lining up to praise Narendra Modi, the prime minister, as a \u201cvaccine guru\u201d who had steered the country out of the health crisis. Public rallies had resumed and cricket stadiums were full.", "A doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Super speciality hospital in Delhi, Ajeet Jain, spoke to the Guardian in March of his frustration at the relaxing of quarantine measures in big cities.", "\u201cPeople are not accepting that the disease is there,\u201d Jain said. \u201cThe practice of sanitisation has gone down, the social distancing is almost zero, mask-wearing is still going on but rest of the things, physical distancing, is almost over.\u201d", "Within days of his remarks, Covid-19 came roaring back. Sequencing of the virus in India is limited, but tests have shown that a soup of variants is responsible for new outbreaks in different parts of the country.", "\u201cWe are getting a lot of the UK variant, we are getting this B1617 variant, also called the double mutation, and we are also seeing a lot of mutations that are isolated but appear to have the capacity to evade antibody responses,\u201d Jameel said.", "\u201cWe can say they are all more infectious based on their behaviour. Though in India we have not been able to correlate the mutant variants with the surge, based on what we\u2019ve seen earlier [in the UK and elsewhere], it\u2019s the logical explanation.\u201d", "It is still unclear if any of the dominating variants circulating in India are more deadly. But the catastrophe playing out across the country suggests some are at least far more infectious than those responsible for the surge last year.", "\u201cIn the first wave, one knew someone who knew someone who had Covid,\u201d Jameel says. \u201cRight now, I can tell you since yesterday, at least five people I knew closely have died. These are people I knew, people I\u2019ve grown up with, who have taught me, who I played with.\u201d"], "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "keywords": ["shocking", "health", "baffling", "virus", "surge", "india", "covid", "decline", "jameel", "variants", "gone", "indias", "knew", "country", "follows", "infectious", "cases"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
