One of around 600,000 babies born in Britain in the plague year of 2020, he has spent all eight months of his life (and most of his gestation) in a world defined by distance and disease.", "His circle is small. He doesn\u2019t get out much. When he does, the faces that peer in at his pushchair are concealed by masks. A baby is usually a magnet for human touch; I\u2019d guess around 300 people had held his older brother by the time he was eight months old. Perhaps 20 people have made physical contact with Aubrey.", "To my mother-in-law, who is in the highest-risk category for coronavirus, he is at once a joy and a death risk. He has never been on a bus or train; he hasn\u2019t met most of his extended family, nor most of our friends; and he doesn\u2019t know any other babies \u2013 discounting the tiny person who laughs at him in the mirror.", "The difference between babyhood now and babyhood as we first experienced it is vast. What was once a busy marketplace of events, activities and sociability has become a ghost town. What effect will this small, sanitised existence have on the babies of 2020-21?", "If all a baby is used to is being indoors, they are missing out on interactions that teach them how the social world works", "I console myself that, while his parents have been slowly losing their minds, Aubrey seems to have things fairly sussed. But as each milestone passes \u2013 as he grows out of the cardigans his grandmothers knitted for him, but never saw him wear \u2013 I can\u2019t help but wonder what the long-term effects will be. Considering how fundamental these first months of a child\u2019s life are to their cognitive and emotional development, what sort of mark will this strange period leave on him? How much are babies missing out on? And can what is lost be regained?", "Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez, a child development specialist at Oxford Brookes University, is leading a study into the effects of coronavirus on families with children aged 8-36 months. Unsurprisingly, she is finding experiences vary hugely across the social divide, with the closure of playgroups and other means of support hitting poorer families particularly hard. \u201cPlaygroups are really important,\u201d says Gonzalez-Gomez. \u201cThey provide enriching activities, they promote child health, they provide links to formal support for parents who are struggling, and they help parents meet other parents. Those babies are missing out on all of that, and so are their parents.\u201d", "The (anonymous) testimonies are strikingly varied. Some parents report their children\u2019s language has \u201cexploded\u201d. \u201cWe were astonished by the improvement in our daughter\u2019s mood, behaviour and development,\u201d writes one parent. Others say the opposite: \u201cChild has become very clingy to me.\u201d Another says their child has become terrified of other adults, particularly men. \u201cIf a man tries to talk to her, she becomes incredibly scared, panic crying, hiding her face in me.\u201d", "\u201cA lot of people have told us that their babies have developed a fear of strangers,\u201d Gonzalez-Gomez adds. \u201cIf all a baby is used to is being indoors, they are missing out on so many interactions that will teach them how the social world works. We don\u2019t know what the long-term effect will be \u2013 but it\u2019s something to keep an eye on.\u201d", "\u2018Hardly anyone really knows Aubrey, not the smell of him, or the weight of him,\u2019 says Richard Godwin. Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The Guardian", "It was very different when Teddy was born, back in the prelapsarian days of 2014. We were living in a third-floor flat on a hectic London high street. My wife\u2019s pregnancy passed in a whir of sociability \u2013 we were supposed to be hosting a New Year\u2019s Eve party when she went into labour \u2013 and, in the days after the return from hospital, we welcomed a constant procession of visitors. Our parents and siblings babysat from when he was 10 days old; we took him to his first party when he was two weeks old; and most days, a world of new faces would appear in front of him on the underground. We manoeuvred his buggy on to buses, escalators, Ryanair flights. When he was six months, we threw a naming-day party for him and I remember being struck at how multilayered his relationships were, even at that tiny age \u2013 how known he was.", "If we had a philosophy, it was: let the world in. It was exhausting. But we reasoned that this was good for him, that he would hopefully learn to be adaptable, sociable and broad-minded. It was good for our families and friends, too. And it was good for us, because: babysitters.", "Hardly anyone really knows Aubrey, not the smell of him, or the weight of him, the way he sighs after sneezing. Visits from friends have been postponed indefinitely. We unbag the nice clothes that we kept from Teddy\u2019s babyhood \u2013 fancy dungarees, swimsuits, romper suits he wore to weddings \u2013 and find the moment for him to wear them has passed. All paranoia about screens has disappeared: we post him on Instagram and set up Zooms. He lurches dribbling towards the screen. At least it makes him real, but it\u2019s a pale imitation. When I closed off the last call to my 90-year-old grandmother, she was crying.", "The first time round, we had a terror of becoming precious, of shrinking back into some conservative vision of the nuclear family, of never escaping the Teletubbyland of routines, monitors, equipment, enclosure. My wife read Rachel Cusk\u2019s memoir, A Life\u2019s Work, which describes child-rearing as \u201cisolating, frequently boring, relentlessly demanding and exhausting\u2026 The day lies ahead empty of landmarks, like a prairie, like an untraversable plain.\u201d Reading back these passages now, I\u2019m struck at how pertinent they are to lockdown. A day \u201cempty of landmarks\u2026 an untraversable plain\u201d? We\u2019ve all had plenty of those. A hell of tininess, softness, gentleness? Frequently boring and relentlessly demanding? Yup.", "Babies want and need interactions with safe, trusted adults. If their parents are at home more, they\u2019ll be lapping it up", "Even given our relatively fortunate situation, we have found many aspects of our youngest\u2019s entry into the world stressful, infuriating, even impossible. My wife endured a long, lonely pregnancy, forced to attend all appointments on her own. No one would tell us who could legally look after our other child when she went into labour. I was \u2013 thankfully \u2013 allowed in for the birth but had to leave soon after. I think we broke the law by leaving Teddy with a friend.", "However, now that Aubrey is here and seemingly doing fine, I begin to see many upsides. He\u2019s calm, giggly, responsive. And he has given a shape and a purpose to this strange, formless period. Amid so much that\u2019s stale and overfamiliar, here is something pristine and new. Given that lockdown has felt at times like an enormous, infantilising, hyper-maternity leave imposed on the entire nation, it makes sense to do it with an actual baby, I guess.", "Dr Liz Gregory, consultant clinical psychologist at the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in south Wales, says these are near-optimal conditions for a baby of his age \u2013 especially one with a father at home and a sibling close at hand. \u201cWhat babies want and need more than anything is interactions with safe, trusted adults,\u201d she says. \u201cIf their parents are at home more, and hopefully with fewer distractions, they\u2019ll be lapping it up.\u201d", "She is quick to add that the experiences of mothers vary wildly, with millions under immense pressure. A study into mental health before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, published in the Lancet in July, found that women, 18- to 24-year-olds, and people living with children \u2013 especially preschool-age children \u2013 were the most likely to have experienced increased mental stress during the pandemic. However, Gregory feels it\u2019s important that new parents shouldn\u2019t beat themselves up because they are not providing the sort of enriching babyhood they\u2019d imagined they would.", "\u201cWhat we often forget is that all of this is new to a baby,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can be unloading a dishwasher and, as long as you\u2019re turning to interact, the baby will find this fascinating.\u201d It\u2019s a bit of a myth, she says, that lots of social interaction will make a baby more sociable. \u201cTemperament comes into it \u2013 but a securely attached baby is more likely to be able to create meaningful attachments themselves. Safe, predictable, reliable certainty makes them feel more confident to explore the world as they grow older.\u201d", "Safe, predictable, reliable certainty \u2013 this was precisely what we rebelled against before. But I find I appreciate it now, and I can\u2019t help wondering if this is what makes him such an amiable baby. He actually sleeps through the night! I prostrate myself daily in thanks for this miracle.", "Also, his mother and I are both here, all the time. I missed most of Teddy\u2019s firsts as I spent that year unhappily commuting to the other side of London, which created an almost unbridgeable chasm between my and my wife\u2019s experiences. Now we are (more or less) united, and Teddy and Aubrey have a bond that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had. I find I don\u2019t miss hauling a pushchair up escalators much, either.", "It is in our wider circle that I feel the greatest loss. When someone brings you joy, the urge is to share that joy. I am looking forward now to a summer of faces and movement. I long to take him to see my parents, my sisters, my granny, our friends \u2013 and I hope a dose of baby will help lift their spirits, too. And you know what would truly lift mine?
