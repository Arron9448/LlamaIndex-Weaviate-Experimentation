It was unclear how many people, if any, remained in custody.", "Organisers had called for protesters in different parts of the capital to converge by sundown on the road leading to the Lebanese parliament in central Beirut. Before they arrived, a demonstration at the barricade leading to the institution had turned violent. Protesters rammed riot police with traffic signs, tree branches and planks, and officers used batons, water cannon and teargas to disperse them.", "The clashes intensified throughout the night as more protesters streamed into the area and made repeated attempts to breach the barricade, hurling rocks and fireworks as police fired rubber bullets and teargas that blanketed central Beirut in a milky haze.", "The pitched battles across the area of Beirut that was a frontline of the country\u2019s 15-year civil war lasted about nine hours, spilling on to the steps and into the courtyard of a prominent mosque, inside which some protesters had sought refuge.", "This latest, most intense phase of what protesters have called a revolution came as the country\u2019s political elites were deadlocked over the formation of a new government that demonstrators have already rejected, and as the country\u2019s economy freefalls, with 160,000 jobs lost and one in 10 companies closing since October.", "One demonstrator, Roula, said the first wave of protests had failed to shake the country\u2019s ruling elites, and so a more hardline approach was called for. \u201cIt\u2019s not peaceful any more because they don\u2019t want to hear us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are trying to rebuild the government with their own people, as if nothing has happened.\u201d", "Demonstrators have called for the appointment of a cabinet of experts with no affiliation to the parties in power. Lebanon\u2019s postwar political system divides power along the lines of the country\u2019s major religious groups, which demonstrators say entrenches corruption and enriches a small group of sectarian elites.", "A shortage of the US dollars that grease the Lebanese economy has led banks to impose capital controls on both American and local currency, preventing people from withdrawing more than $300 (\u00a3230) a week and focusing popular rage on the banking system.", "\u201cI want to be there breaking doors, breaking glass, burning banks,\u201d Roula said. \u201cAs civilised and educated as I am, I want to be there yelling at ministers dining in fancy restaurants with our money. I want to be there to humiliate them.\u201d", "Human rights groups accused the police of using disproportionate force to crack down on the demonstrations on Saturday and throughout the past week. \u201cThe level of injuries we saw last night we haven\u2019t seen since the protests started, both the severity and the amount,\u201d said Aya Majzoub, the Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch.", "\u201cWe saw riot police firing very large quantities of teargas including at protesters who were already dispersing \u2026 They were firing directly at people and there is clear footage showing teargas canisters hitting people\u2019s heads, causing serious injuries. We are very fortunate nobody lost their lives.\u201d", "Police accused protesters of rioting and posted pictures of officers being treated for injuries from pillars stripped of tiles that they said the demonstrators had been flinging at security personnel.", "\u201cFor the protests to turn into a blatant attack on the security forces and public and private properties, this is condemned and totally unacceptable,\u201d Raya El Hassan, the interior minister, tweeted.", "This week\u2019s protests have left the windows of dozens of banks across Beirut shattered and their walls tagged with anti-government slogans, including during demonstrations that became violent outside Lebanon\u2019s central bank in the Hamra neighbourhood, where Monia was sitting in a gutter holding her injured nose.", "\u201cThe police hit me,\u201d the architect, 25, said. \u201cThere was someone they were trying to arrest, a guy. I didn\u2019t even know him, but I grabbed him so they couldn\u2019t take him and they hit me instead.\u201d", "She said the collapsing value of the lira had cut the value of her salary of 1.5m Lebanese lira (\u00a3762) a month by a third, while the depreciating currency had also pushed up the price of imported goods. \u201cMy earnings have gone down without me doing anything,\u201d she said.", "Her parents had forbidden her from joining the demonstrations after men in civilian clothes, sometimes wearing masks and thought to be political party supporters, started turning up and scuffling with protesters. \u201cThey think I\u2019m at work,\u201d Monia said.", "The protests started on 17 October after the government attempted to impose a tax on WhatsApp, the messaging app that has become ubiquitous in a country whose two state-owned mobile phone companies charge some of the highest rates in the world.", "They rapidly evolved into a broad movement calling for an overhaul of the system, drawing in communities from the northern city of Tripoli, southern cities such as Nabatieh and elsewhere that were considered to be strongholds of established political forces such as the Sunni-aligned Future Movement and the Shia group Hezbollah.", "The first wave of demonstrations appeared to be closer to a street party, with tens of thousands of people across the country and across sectarian lines gathering to sing, dance and chant anti-government slogans.", "Political elites have been reluctant to heed the key demand of demonstrators: that they relinquish power and allow an interim cabinet to pass fundamental governance reforms. The cabinet collapsed after the former prime minister Saad Hariri resigned in November, citing the protests, and leaders are deadlocked over the formation of a new ruling group."], "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "keywords": ["hundreds", "countrys", "week", "violence", "injured", "teargas", "political", "anger", "flares", "beirut", "demonstrations", "demonstrators", "protesters", "protests", "lebanon", "called"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
