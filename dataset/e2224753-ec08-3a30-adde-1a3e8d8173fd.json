Lee. The Unite the Right rally had been called in response to the Charlottesville city council\u2019s decision to remove a statue of Lee from a park, and, on the second day of demonstrations, James Alex Fields, Jr., a twenty-year-old white supremacist, drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring dozens of people and killing the thirty-two-year-old Heather Heyer.", "Still, five days later, Trump, tweeted, \u201cSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\u201d He went on to ask if Washington and Jefferson would be next. I wrote at the time that it was striking to see Trump and his then chief of staff, John Kelly, both Northerners, take up the cause of the apostate Lee. But, given that Trump\u2019s willingness to verbally assail his perceived enemies is equalled only by his willingness to pander to those whom he considers supporters, perhaps it should not have been surprising that a Queens-born politician would wind up embracing Southern Lost Cause denialism. Earlier this year, Trump reiterated that support, referring to Lee as \u201ca great general, whether you like it or not. He was one of the great generals.\u201d", "Trump returned to the topic of the Civil War yet again last weekend, when he tweeted a quote from a Baptist pastor\u2019s statement that to impeach Trump would render a \u201cCivil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Hyperbole is Trump\u2019s native tongue, but, even by that standard, it was a wildly grandiose claim to argue that not only would his impeachment echo throughout the nation a hundred and fifty-four years from now but also that American politics would continue to grapple with the implications of who stood on which side of the question, and museums and entire fields of scholarship would be devoted to helping the country understand the roots of such a catastrophe. The entire narcissistic arc of the President\u2019s public life can be understood as a quest to force the world to reckon with Trump as a man of consequence, even if he is, in fact, a man bereft of ideas and original thought.", "We tend to speak of the Civil War as a singular event that took place between 1861 and 1865, which was caused either by the expansion of slavery or an abstract argument over the principle of \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d depending on where you stand politically. But the Civil War\u2019s origins don\u2019t lie in the politics of 1861; they\u2019re a product of the politics of 1776. The four years of war between the Union and the eleven seceding states of the Confederacy were the culmination of decades of attempts to forestall armed conflict over slavery. A short list of the political events leading to the war would include the Northwest Ordinance, the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Jackson-era Gag Rules on slavery, the Missouri Compromise, the Nullification Crisis of 1831\u201332, the Mexican-American War, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, John Brown\u2019s raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry, the Dred Scott decision, and the election of Abraham Lincoln. In 1858, when William Henry Seward, who was then a senator from New York, referred to the conditions that preceded the war as an \u201cirrepressible conflict,\u201d he did so with decades of political history to support that conclusion.", "By comparison, Trump\u2019s problems are self-inflicted. He brought the freewheeling amorality with which he led the Trump Organization\u2014an enterprise he continues to profit from\u2014to the White House. (An amendment to Seward\u2019s speech that includes Trump would be titled \u201cIrrepressible Conflicts of Interest.\u201d) He is not grappling with vast foundational questions. From the loftiest perch in American politics, Trump has spewed vitriol, trampled norms, provoked violence, nurtured racism and misogyny, invited foreign intervention into an American election, befriended adversaries, and alienated allies. He followed up his civil-war threat on Tuesday, tweeting, \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of the United States of America!\u201d It was a breathtakingly irresponsible and foolish comment that could reasonably provoke violence among his most devout followers. As the blog Lawfare noted this week, far-right militias are taking Trump\u2019s language about war and the possibility of a Democratic coup d\u2019\u00e9tat seriously.", "A hundred and six years separate the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and the near-impeachment of Richard Nixon. Twenty-four years later, in 1998, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, and acquitted by the Senate. Should Trump be impeached, there will be, for the first time in the nation\u2019s history, a generation of Americans that has seen two impeachments in their lifetimes. That is itself a statement on how tumultuous the politics of this era are.", "Nevertheless, civil war is not the primary concern that should be raised by the prospect of impeachment. Trump\u2019s potential to provoke volatile divisions is not limited to his fellow-Americans. Among the more unanticipated traits of the Trump Administration is its relative reluctance to use military force, despite the President\u2019s own verbal combativeness. The inability of the now-departed national-security adviser John Bolton to persuade Trump to attack Iran\u2014and Trump\u2019s habit of ridiculing Bolton\u2019s hawkishness\u2014are examples of this. When pushed to retaliate for Iran\u2019s downing of an American drone, Trump approved a strike only to cancel it at the eleventh hour. He was apparently concerned that a military intervention might hurt his chances of re\u00eblection. Yet we have also seen that Trump is acutely sensitive to embarrassment. It\u2019s s not inconceivable that the humiliating spectacle of a public tribunal and the possibility of a premature and ignoble end to his fiasco of a Presidency could provoke him to use the military to lash out abroad. Baseline Trump is erratic and unpredictable. The thought of an agitated Trump under the pressure of potential impeachment further navigating the complexities of Iran or North Korea should be profoundly unsettling. The dark portent is not that Trump will inspire a re\u00ebnactment of the central conflicts of America\u2019s past. It\u2019s that he will author a novel catastrophe all his own."], "pubDate": null, "id": "e2224753-ec08-3a30-adde-1a3e8d8173fd", "keywords": ["trumps", "politics", "war", "impeachment", "american", "military", "trump", "civil", "states", "warns", "facing", "lee"], "title": "Why Trump, Facing Impeachment, Warns of Civil War", "summary": "Earlier this year, Trump reiterated that support, referring to Lee as \u201ca great general, whether you like it or not.\nBut the Civil War\u2019s origins don\u2019t lie in the politics of 1861; they\u2019re a product of the politics of 1776.\nFrom the loftiest perch in American politics, Trump has spewed vitriol, trampled norms, provoked violence, nurtured racism and misogyny, invited foreign intervention into an American election, befriended adversaries, and alienated allies.\nNevertheless, civil war is not the primary concern that should be raised by the prospect of impeachment.\nThe thought of an agitated Trump under the pressure of potential impeachment further navigating the complexities of Iran or North Korea should be profoundly unsettling.", "authors": ["Jelani Cobb", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "David Remnick"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
