We had a lot of fun with the game's demo that's out now, and it's definitely a looter shooter that harks back to fond memories of games like Borderlands, Destiny, Fallout, and People Can Fly's own Bulletstorm. So strap in tight, because we're going live!", "You can take to the world of Outriders solo or with friends to build up skills, explore untold dangers, make a new future for humanity, and figure out just what the heck that mystery signal really means. We loved our time with the shooter, which you can learn more about right here with our hands-on impressions, and we can't wait to see what this game has to offer beyond what the demo showcased.", "Join Alex Stadnik, Dan Tack, and Liana Ruppert as they become the badasses they were truly meant to be with Outriders. Will we finally be smart and choose different classes? Will we finally make a character we're happy with?
