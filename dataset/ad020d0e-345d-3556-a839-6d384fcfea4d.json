Except instead of Dunder Mifflin, the workplace was Thrive Capital, where she\u2019s the director of incubation and he\u2019s general counsel. Catherine had just moved from New York to San Francisco, and their friendship was immediate. The two didn\u2019t actually start dating until much later. \u201cWe even tried to set each other up with several of our close friends,\u201d Catherine admits. \u201cThis made for some hilarious wedding speeches!\u201d", "They\u2019d been dating for two years when Jed proposed in April on the first warm day of spring. \u201cWe got engaged at home in New York, which was incredibly heartfelt and intimate,\u201d Catherine remembers. \u201cMy sister, who had been in on the whole thing, celebrated with us with champagne on our front stoop, and Jed and I capped off the night with dinner at the Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare. Given the excitement of the day, the meal was all a blur\u2014though, I have it on good authority that the food was delightful!\u201d", "The two love to travel, and a few months before they got engaged, they decided on a whim to spend Presidents\u2019 Day weekend at the Fogo Island Inn in Newfoundland, Canada. \u201cFebruary in Canada, not to mention one of the northeastern most points in North America, sounds a bit crazy in retrospect, so I\u2019m glad we went through with it,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cFogo Island is thought to be one of the \u2018four corners of the earth\u2019 according to the Flat Earth Society\u2014a group of people who literally believe the world is flat\u2014and after 3 flights, an hour-long car ride, and a 75 minute ferry followed by yet another 30 minute car ride to get there, we tend to agree that it truly is at the edge of the earth!\u201d", "As soon as they arrived, they fell in love with the rugged beauty of the island. \u201cBut it was the story behind the Fogo Island Inn that resonated most deeply with us and inspired us to get married there,\u201d Catherine explains. Fogo Island's economy was built on cod fishing, but overfishing in the 90s left the island\u2019s economy in a dire state. An entrepreneur named Zita Cobb, who grew up on Fogo island, had the idea to revitalize its economy by creating a new industry built around tourism, art, design, and food\u2014starting with a luxury hotel that incorporated the people and history of Fogo Island. As the Inn says it: \u2018Many luxury properties have a charitable foundation. Our charitable foundation has a luxury Inn.\u2019 The inn hires primarily from the local community, training them in areas like hospitality, fine dining, and as community tour guides and drivers\u2014and the furniture and textiles used by the inn are all made by local craftspeople. \u201cWe love that the Fogo Island Inn is a social enterprise, and that 100% of its profits are reinvested in the local community,\u201d Catherine says.", "During their trip in February, the inn arranged for them to take a tour around the island with an older gentleman who had spent much of his life as a teacher on Fogo Island. \u201cWe parked at the side of the road, waiting for a snowstorm to pass, and while making small talk, we mentioned that the staff at the Inn had told us that our guide had an amazing singing voice,\u201d Catherine remembers. \u201cMoments later, with the storm enveloping our car, he let out the most beautiful and unexpected acapella version of Bruce Springsteen's \u2018If I Should Fall Behind.\u2019 Stunned, I looked over at Jed, who is from New Jersey and best described as a Bruce enthusiast, only to see that he was openly weeping! It was such a special and moving moment that we later decided to walk down the aisle to that very song.\u201d", "After absorbing the remarkable beauty of the island, learning that the inn\u2019s primary mission is to support the local economy, and sharing such a touching moment with a member of the community, Catherine and Jed knew they had to find a way to share this special place with their friends and family, so when they got engaged later that spring, it was obvious where they should get married. \u201cWe wanted our wedding to feel like a relaxed vacation with our best friends and family, and for the weekend to be incredibly intimate,\u201d Catherine explains. They took over the entire inn, and its 29 rooms allowed for just over 60 guests and only their immediate families. \u201cSomething about being together on a tiny, faraway island fostered new friendships and experiences, which was truly all that we could have asked for out of our wedding. Whenever we looked out the window, we saw our friends hiking, fishing, and boating together\u2026and a few brave souls jumped into the freezing North Atlantic Ocean as well!\u201d", "Catherine and Jed wanted the aesthetic of the weekend to be authentic to Fogo Island and hoped their \u201cblack tie-ish\u201d dress code encouraged an elegant but low-key approach to dressing. The Fogo Island Inn is modern and minimalist by design, so wedding planners, Britt Cole and Francie Dorman from 42 North, suggested they practice restraint and use florals and decor to enhance the inn\u2019s magic, without overpowering it. The couple also worked with Kristen Caissie of Moon Canyon on florals and design throughout the weekend.", "Fogo Island Inn has seven distinct seasons, and the weather is notoriously unpredictable. The week leading up to the wedding, the weather forecast said it would be extremely cold and rainy, with a chance of snow, and when everyone arrived on Thursday evening, it was as overcast and cold as the forecast had suggested. But as soon as Friday morning rolled around, the skies parted, and they had warm, sunny weather all weekend. \u201cLucky doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how we felt,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cWe were told everyone on the island had been praying for us all week! Surely enough, as soon as we left on Monday, the rain and cold temperatures rolled back in.\u201d", "Catherine and Jed wanted each night of the weekend to feel very different, and the first night, they embraced Fogo\u2019s folksy side, welcoming guests with a traditional crab boil-up. There were local folk musicians playing through the evening, and colorful armchairs, furniture, and textiles made at the Fogo Island Inn\u2019s woodshop to highlight the local crafts culture. Catherine wore a Markarian dress embroidered with gold birds and constellations, a fitting motif as their first trip to Fogo Island coincided with a bird watching convention at the inn. Guests were seated at three long tables, and dinner was served family style, so it felt like a massive dinner party. \u201cIt was such a cozy way to ease into the weekend,\u201d Catherine says.", "The next day, the ceremony took place under a chuppah that the Fogo Island Inn\u2019s woodshop made for the couple. \u201cAs far as we know, it was the first chuppah on Fogo Island!\u201d Catherine says. The chuppah\u2019s design was inspired by the local building vernacular and fishing stages around the island and was made of spruce, a traditional building material.", "The bride\u2019s Oscar de la Renta dress was based on one that she first tried on after seeing it in the designer\u2019s runway show. \u201cThe team at Oscar was absolutely wonderful to work with at every step of the process,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was important for me to feel like myself, and that meant keeping my makeup and jewelry clean and simple.\u201d Her shoes were Manolo Blahnik satin slingbacks, and the only two pieces of jewelry she wore were the diamond stud earrings that Jed had made for their first anniversary, and her engagement ring, which is a round diamond set in a sapphire halo. She carried a white and blue pearl purse by Ganni and wore a white coat by Pologeorgis when they were outdoors during the evening. Anna Nenoiu did her hair and makeup throughout the weekend, and for the wedding, they went with a loose, textured bun with a few pieces pulled out\u2014easy and unfussy.", "\u201cWe felt very lucky that our beloved rabbi, Rabbi Matthew Gewirtz of Temple B\u2019nai Jeshurun, was able to come to Fogo Island to officiate our ceremony,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cJed and I are both very close with him as I studied with him for my conversion to Judaism. Rabbi Gewirtz also spoke beautifully about Jed's late father, whom he knew incredibly well. There was not a dry eye in the room.\u201d", "The couple decided to forgo having wedding parties and exchanged their own vows. \u201cWith such an intimate wedding, we felt that every person there was genuinely an important part of our story, and wanted to set that tone right away,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cThe whole service was unbelievably emotional! So many of our guests commented on how heartfelt and insightful Rabbi Gewirtz\u2019s words and stories about us were.\u201d", "After the ceremony, guests moved straight to an outdoor cocktail hour overlooking the ocean. The raw bar featured Canadian oysters, mussels, caviar, and crudit\u00e9, and passed plates included salted quail eggs, lamb croquettes, and salt cod. \u201cIt's a Fogo Island tradition for locals to do a gun salute for the newlyweds, which everyone got very into,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cMy new husband was a little too eager to participate!\u201d", "At dinner, tablescapes with a very \u201cof the earth\u201d feel were inspired by the rocky landscape of Fogo. Early spring tones of chartreuse and rust were meant to play off of the blue of the ocean and the black ceramics and chairs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anything to feel flown-in, so Kristen designed the floral arrangements to be low and sprawling,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cAnd she foraged for rocks and moss around the island. Kristen sourced all Canadian-grown flowers\u2014she flew from Los Angeles to Toronto to pick up the flowers, flew with the flowers to St. John's, and then drove them five hours to Fogo Island\u2014a truly Herculean effort on her part.\u201d The wedding dinner started with lobster dumplings followed by seashore-raised lamb and fresh cod. \u201cFood was one of our top priorities for the weekend,\u201d Catherine notes. \u201cJed worked with Chef Jonathan Gushue on the menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the weekend\u2014we served personal twists on local fare.\u201d", "For late night festivities, Catherine changed into a gold sequin minidress by Alexis. \u201cI staunchly refused to bustle the train of my wedding dress,\u201d she says. \u201cSo once the dancing really began, it felt pretty glorious to get into something small and sparkly.\u201d After the reception, the newlyweds cut their wedding cake before heading outside for hot toddies, Irish coffee, and fireworks. At this point in the night, it was pretty chilly, so everyone bundled up with hand warmers, hot drinks, as well as colorful wool scarves, blankets, mittens, and beanies that were knit on Fogo Island.", "From there, the party got started, and DJ Jay McElfresh kept everyone dancing until the early hours of the morning. Desserts like screech brownies (a Fogo Island special), sea buckthorn marshmallows, partridgeberry jellies, and custard donuts were passed around alongside with an indeterminate number of tequila shots. \u201cIn fact, we were told that our group polished off the entire supply of tequila on Fogo Island that night!\u201d Catherine admits. \u201cA time was had!\u201d"], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Alexandra Maco", "Elise Taylor", "Alexandra Macon", "Jenna Rennert", "Ed Droste"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/catherine-kong-jed-feldman-fogo-island-canada-wedding", "keywords": ["inn", "local", "catherine", "wedding", "elegant", "jed", "dinner", "island", "canadas", "weekend", "intimate", "night", "fogo", "rugged"], "summary": "An entrepreneur named Zita Cobb, who grew up on Fogo island, had the idea to revitalize its economy by creating a new industry built around tourism, art, design, and food\u2014starting with a luxury hotel that incorporated the people and history of Fogo Island.\nFogo Island Inn has seven distinct seasons, and the weather is notoriously unpredictable.\nThe next day, the ceremony took place under a chuppah that the Fogo Island Inn\u2019s woodshop made for the couple.\n\u201cAs far as we know, it was the first chuppah on Fogo Island!\u201d Catherine says.\n\u201cIn fact, we were told that our group polished off the entire supply of tequila on Fogo Island that night!\u201d Catherine admits.", "title": "An Elegant, Intimate Wedding on Canada\u2019s Rugged Fogo Island"}
