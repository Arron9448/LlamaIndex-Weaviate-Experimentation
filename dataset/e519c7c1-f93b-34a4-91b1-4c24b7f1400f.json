About how angry they were, how appalled they were and, as three members of the AAPI community themselves, how helpless they felt. \u201cRacism is such a complex issue and it is hard to know where to start,\u201d Nguyen tells Vogue.", "But as the saying goes, you have to start somewhere.", "Somewhere, for these female founders in the New York design space (Rao runs Tantuvi, Lee is one half of Brooklyn\u2019s Ladies & Gentlemen Studio, and Nguyen heads Hello Human, a public relations collective), was their vast rolodex of artisans and makers. \u201cWe wanted to figure out a way to help the families,\u201d says Nguyen. \u201cSo we just sent an email out to all the designers we could think of to see if they would be open to coming together to donate products for an Instagram fundraiser.\u201d", "They included a link to a Google Sheet where creators could sign up to give a design object or two\u2014whether it was artfully-assembled jewelry, a handcrafted lamp, or detail-oriented desk. The idea was that they'd take the handful of objects and offer a chance for Instagram users to win them in exchange for monetary donations. Within seconds, an avalanche of high-profile names and their haute offerings populated the previously blank rows. \u201cSeeing the sheet fill up so quickly was very humbling for us. We felt a huge amount of solidarity,\u201d Nguyen says.", "The final result? #DesignForATL, an Instagram raffle that starts, well, now. Users can browse a selection of high-end goods on the @designforatl account. To \u201cbuy\u201d tickets for them, they must donate to the Asian Americans Advance Justice\u2019s Atlanta chapter, a civil rights group that's raising money for the hate-crime victims and their families.", "As of this writing, #DesignforATL has works from over 80 designers, including a lamp from Eny Lee Parker, a fringed Eos mirror from Ben and Anja Bloc, a Herman Miller Noguchi table, a wool blanket from Studio Proba, a Gaetano Pesce glass tray from Coming Soon, and a pond vase from Debbie Carlos.
