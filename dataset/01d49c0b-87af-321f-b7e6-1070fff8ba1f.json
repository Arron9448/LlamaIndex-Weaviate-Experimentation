You open the front flap, and it has a view for the entire year at a glance where all 365 days get a little tiny cell that you can fill in. And then you keep going, and you get a view for the whole year broken down by month. and then you keep going, and you get a view for every month of the year. And then you turn even more pages, and you're into the meat of it, which is one page for every week. And the weekly pages also have an adjacent page that's just for taking notes. So I really like it because I can look at my week at a glance, and then I can take notes of all the things that I need to do that week on the adjacent page. It's really wonderful. They're dirt cheap right now. I think like full price is under $20, and now that it's the end of January, they're on clearance. So I got mine for I think like $11.99 or something like that. If there's a Muji store in your town, you can get them there. Otherwise, of course, you could just go to the great wilds of the internet and try and find it.", "LG: I also love Muji's, just their notebooks. You can get a really nice, unlined notebook for $3.", "MC: Yeah, I think it's like $4 now. But still.", "LG: Oh, prices went up this year. Last time I bought them last year, they were $3. But they're great.", "MC: The paper's very nice.", "LG: Yeah. The binding broke on one of them once. But other than-", "MC: Well, four buck is four bucks.", "LG: I've been using then for years, years and years. I really, really like them. OK, my recommendation this week is the Scriptnotes podcast hosted by John August, who's the screenwriter behind Big Fish, Charlie's Angels, and other movies you probably know, and Craig Mazin, or it might be Mazin. I apologize if I ... I think it's Mazin ... who's the writer and director of Chernobyl. But this podcast is all about screenwriting, so whether you are a screenwriter, in which case you'll probably understand some of the more inside baseball things they talk about, or whether you're just fascinated by the screenwriting and movie-making process, It's a great podcast. But in the latest episode, Craig is out, and Greta Gerwig is in. She's in the hot seat. It's great. Greta Gerwig is the writer and director behind Lady Bird and most recently Little Women. I have not yet seen Little Women. I'm really excited. I'm going to see it this weekend.", "But in this episode ... it's about an hour and five minutes long ... she breaks down her process behind writing and directing this film. Really just interesting anecdotes throughout. She talks about how she rediscovered Little Women. When she was around 30, she was moving apartments, and she found the book, and she started reading again and said, \"I really want to write and direct this.\" Initially, she was hired to just write it, not direct. She talks about how she handles past scenes in the film with what are supposed to be current scenes. So the past scene she'll print out and read, and then the current scenes presumably are just in like standard black text on the page. And she's very funny. She talks about how someone on set is like, \"Well, it's obvious to you that that's the past scene, but how are the viewers going to know?\" And she just kind of assumes that most viewers are sophisticated and can navigate between timelines and things like that."], "authors": ["Wired Staff", "Wired Staf"], "keywords": ["theyre", "view", "wheel", "women", "things", "really", "week", "page", "going", "zero", "little", "gadget", "buttons", "lab", "think", "podcast"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
