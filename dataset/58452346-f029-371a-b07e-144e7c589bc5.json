Biden Jr.\u2019s win, telling them to \u201cbe there, will be wild!\u201d At a rally just before the violence, he repeated many of his falsehoods about how the election was stolen, then dispatched the marchers to the Capitol as those proceedings were about to start.", "Here are some notable excerpts from Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, with analysis.", "Trump urged his supporters to \u2018fight much harder\u2019 against \u2018bad people\u2019 and \u2018show strength\u2019 at the Capitol.", "\u201cRepublicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It\u2019s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we\u2019re going to have to fight much harder. \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we\u2019re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we\u2019re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\u201d", "The president\u2019s speech was riddled with violent imagery and calls to fight harder than before. By contrast, he made only a passing suggestion that the protest should be nonviolent, saying, \u201cI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\u201d", "During Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment last year, one of his defenses was that the primary accusation against him \u2014 that he abused his power by withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get its president to announce a corruption investigation into Mr. Biden \u2014 was not an ordinary crime, so it did not matter even if it were true. Most legal specialists said that made no difference for impeachment purposes, but in any case that argument would not be a defense here.
