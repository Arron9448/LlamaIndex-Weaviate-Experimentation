That number has jumped to 11 with Funko planning a second series slated to launch this April.", "Oddly, all of the figures are again just of Miles. Prowler, Rhino, and other characters have not yet gotten Pop figures. This line does, however, dive deep into Miles' closest of suits, and consists of the tech-based 2020 suit, the Bodega Cat suit, the winter suit, and more. You can see all of the new additions below:", "Original Story: Many of you are working your way through Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales on your PlayStation 4 or newly purchased PlayStation 5. If you like what you play, or are just a huge fan of Miles Morales, you'll soon be able to add three new Funko Pop figures inspired by the game to your collection.", "Unlike the figures that were created for Marvel's Spider-Man in 2018, you won't get figures of any villains or supporting characters. All three figures are of Miles in action. The first Pop is of what Insomniac calls Miles' \"Iconic Suit,\" which is modeled after his traditional comic book garb. He's airborne and ready to clobber someone with a Venom Punch. Since he is highly posed, he needs to be positioned on a stand.", "The second figure is exactly the same pose, but is mask free, just like Game Informer's recently released cover story.", "The third figure is slightly different in pose, showing Miles soaring soaring through the air on a webline. We also see him in his sleek Track Suit.", "All three of these figures are in Funko's traditional Pop scale and will be available on March 4.", "I reviewed Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales for Game Informer, and gave it a respectable 9 out of 10 score, saying \"For a second act, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn\u2019t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac\u2019s Spider-Man series.\"", "Are you playing Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales?
