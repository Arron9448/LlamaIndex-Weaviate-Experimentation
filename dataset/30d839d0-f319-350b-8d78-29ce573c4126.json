A recurring phrase in their speeches hails \u201cchanges unseen in a hundred years\u201d. Bluntly, Communist Party chiefs feel China is rising and democratic countries\u2014battered by recession and racked by partisan disputes\u2014are falling behind.", "As 2021 dawned, the European Union offered China a further boost by agreeing to a commercial pact that will bind some powerful European companies still more tightly to China. The deal brushes aside concerns about dependence on Chinese markets. It tackles allegations of forced labour in supply chains by accepting promises that China will make \u201ccontinued and sustained efforts\u201d to ratify international conventions on workers\u2019 rights.", "Politically, China sees the deal\u2014a comprehensive investment agreement whose benefits mostly flow to a few German carmakers, European insurance companies and other well-connected firms\u2014as an early victory over Joe Biden. Aides to America\u2019s president-elect had hinted publicly that Europe might like to wait and co-ordinate efforts to curb China\u2019s worst trade and human-rights abuses. Those hints were ignored. Hosting EU ambassadors for lunch just before Christmas, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, praised Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d. The phrase was first dreamed up by French politicians. Mr Wang\u2019s use of it sent a clear message. As envoys at the lunch tell it, China was thanking the agreement\u2019s main backers, notably Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, for refusing to join America in the one alliance that Chinese leaders fear: a global coalition of like-minded nations willing to exclude China from sensitive supply chains or to block investments, in defence of democratic norms and freedoms.", "Critics accuse EU leaders of shocking naivety. They were particularly dismayed when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, claimed that the agreement promoted Europe\u2019s \u201ccore values\u201d, and that China\u2019s vague commitments provided \u201ca lever to eradicate forced labour\u201d. Actually, it is not fair to call European leaders naive about the investment accord. Rather, their motives are a mix of self-interest, cynicism about Europe\u2019s limited clout and pessimism about the prospects for joint action with Mr Biden\u2019s America. A European summarises the decision-making process: \u201cWe had an economic interest in concluding a deal. The Chinese had a political interest in demonstrating that China is not isolated. There was a perception we would get nothing more.\u201d", "Views among European ambassadors and business bosses in China have hardened noticeably as the country takes one illiberal turn after another under President Xi Jinping, an austere autocrat. In particular, 2020 was a turning-point. A new national-security law trampled on Hong Kong\u2019s Western-style freedoms. Chinese troops killed Indian soldiers in a border clash. Intent on smothering discussions of China\u2019s disastrous early handling of covid-19, Chinese diplomats threatened governments across the West, and were praised at home as patriotic \u201cwolf warriors\u201d. China banned many Australian imports to punish that country for suggesting an independent probe into the pandemic\u2019s origins.", "Early in 2019 the EU published a strikingly honest China strategy, calling the country a partner, a competitor but also a \u201csystemic rival\u201d. Among Europeans charged with managing relations with China, that tripartite view of China has not changed. The investment agreement is best understood as a holdover from a time when Europe was unwilling to acknowledge deep ideological differences with China. The EU \u2019s negotiating mandate for the deal dates from 2013. With its focus on market access and level playing fields, it sets out to manage China as a partner and competitor, says Reinhard B\u00fctikofer, a German Green and chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with China. \u201cIt almost completely ignores systemic rivalry,\u201d he objects, speaking by Zoom from Berlin. He expects the parliament, which must approve the pact, to seek stronger commitments on labour rights, notably in factories using workers from Xinjiang, a western region where Muslim minorities are governed with an iron fist.", "Mr B\u00fctikofer\u2019s approach is increasingly popular among Western elected politicians. It is a minority view among European bigwigs in China. Most argue for trade talks that seek whatever concessions are going, then for separate efforts to press China into curbing its worst abuses, and, most important, for work at home on anti-subsidy measures and security-screening of investments.", "China is not about to change: time to build better defences", "Chinese voices insist that clashes over values are not inevitable, at least when talking to foreigners. Wang Yiwei, director of the EU studies centre at Renmin University, chides Americans for thinking like religious missionaries about engagement with China. In contrast, \u201cEurope is secular; it is not seeking to convert China to a multiparty system or a free press,\u201d he asserts, approvingly.", "European sources in Beijing ascribe China\u2019s willingness to cut a deal, after much foot-dragging, to two factors. First, to the belief of Liu He, a deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy, that some European competition is good for state-owned firms. Second, to a decision by Mr Xi to do a deal before Mr Biden takes office."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["cynicism", "chinas", "flawed", "euchina", "labour", "commercial", "china", "chinese", "leaders", "investment", "deal", "european", "explains", "pact", "chaguan", "mr", "eu"], "pubDate": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
