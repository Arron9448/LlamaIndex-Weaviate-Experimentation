whole time talking about the pandemic,", "but I also wanna talk about your life and your history.", "So let's start.", "And I'm gonna ask a question that I just have to ask,", "because I am in fact a journalist.", "As we are speaking, the president of the United States", "is scheduled to leave the hospital any minute.", "And he's gonna go back to the White House.", "And I'm not gonna ask you to comment on", "his strange regimen of drugs, or how he's feeling.", "I know you're not his personal physician,", "and that's not your thing.", "But I do wanna talk about public health", "because this afternoon he tweeted, COVID, no big thing.", "And you know, 210,000 Americans have died,", "and 7 million have been infected.", "Is it fair to say, no big thing, don't be afraid of it?", "Yeah well, you know, Michael,", "that's been one of the things that have been", "sort of a bone of contention in communication", "of the seriousness of this.", "I mean, obviously, it's a very unusual pathogen", "that can have virtually no effect", "in the sense of 40%, 45% of people can be without symptoms.", "But there are a group of individuals", "who fall into a certain subset or category,", "namely the elderly and those with underlying conditions", "at any age, who can have a severe outcome.", "So when you look at the now 210,000 American,", "people in the United States of America who've died,", "and you talk about the 7 million who've been infected,", "and the 1 million who've died globally.", "I think anybody who's looking at this realistically", "has to say that this is a very serious situation.", "Not to harp on this, but the president is elderly", "and he has significant preexisting conditions.", "Shouldn't the message about those people be", "please take care of yourself,", "don't spend three days in the hospital,", "but take care of yourself and rest?", "The message should be that we should try", "as best as we can to avoid infection.", "No matter who you are, how old you are,", "or what your underlying condition is.", "We should not trivialize it.", "Well, in all the time I've known you", "it seems like you've struggled against one virus or another.", "Through many crises, through the AIDS epidemic.", "I think you changed pretty dramatically", "during that epidemic.", "And I'm just gonna play this one clip", "that I think is emblematic of", "the way you look at the world now.", "And it happened in 1989, and you were with Marty Delaney,", "a beloved activist in San Francisco.", "And he took you on a bit of a tour.", "And he took you to see a guy who was sick.", "And this is what happened.", "And he looked at me and he says,", "what kind of a choice is that?", "You're telling me I should either die or go blind,", "but I can't do both.", "And when he said that, I says, oh my god,", "this is really nuts.", "And that's when I became a real,", "almost confrontative activist against my own government,", "that was not allowing these things to happen.", "That's when it became clear that I had to be an activist,", "no matter what the government was saying.", "That these activists had certain things", "that they were confronting that I said to myself,", "very clearly, it was unambiguous.", "I said, if I were in their shoes,", "I would be doing exactly what they were doing.", "In fact, maybe even more forcefully.", "But I felt unreasonably restricted,", "restrictive regulatory principles,", "essentially keeping people out of the dialogue.", "Not allowing activists, who were almost exclusively", "young gay men, not allowing them into the discussion", "about things that were directly impacting", "their lives and their health.", "And they had a lot to offer.", "That scene in the Castro District of San Francisco,", "when Marty brought me into the room of this young man", "that was going blind from cytomegalovirus infection.", "And we, the government, had put these restrictions", "on the clinical trial that would not allow him", "to get the benefit of a drug that could save his eyesight", "because he happened to be on a drug", "that was the only anti-HIV drug.", "And we were afraid that if we had him on two drugs,", "that in fact we wouldn't know the toxicity", "of the one that we're testing.", "We put him in a completely impossible situation.", "And he said, you've given me an interesting choice,", "I could either die or go blind.", "Now, what the hell is the matter with you guys?", "And that's when I paused, and I said, yeah,", "what the hell is the matter with us?", "And particularly when I took the job as the NIAD director,", "I found myself in the middle of a back to back", "sequence of difficult issues that called more upon", "my understanding of human nature, or as much,", "not necessarily more, but as much upon", "my understanding of human nature", "than upon my understanding of human physiology.", "Speaking of understanding human nature,", "there was a guy who died this year", "who was very important to both of us.", "Called both of us murderers at different points in our life,", "but we ended up both being somewhat close to him.", "And I wanted to play just one little interaction", "between you, and the person I'm talking about", "for those who are out there is Larry Kramer,", "who was a signature AIDS activist,", "and a really remarkable person,", "who was both difficult and thrilling at the same time.", "And I'd like to play an exchange.", "This is from the '90s when Tony and Larry", "were on a television talk show together.", "[Larry] I wanna say something about about Tony Fauci,", "because I think the world must think", "I hate him or something, the way I'm going on tonight.", "I love Tony.", "Actually, I think I probably have a more", "complicated relationship with Tony", "than anybody in my entire life.", "He is a man, an ordinary man,", "who is being asked to play God.", "And he is being punished because he cannot be God.", "And that is a terrible situation to be in,", "to be the lightning rod for all of us.", "True?", "[Tony laughs]", "Yeah, to a certain extent.", "I wouldn't, I'm laughing because I'm just reflecting", "about that conversation with Larry that we had,", "and so many other conversations.", "Larry would be very theatrical and confrontative,", "but there was so much wisdom in his words.", "And to an extent it was true", "because I was put in a position", "that I was the face of the government,", "and I was leading the biomedical research effort.", "And the biomedical research effort could not possibly", "have moved quickly enough to save so many of the people", "back then who you and I know and knew.", "And some of whom were very close to me.", "Who were infected and who died of AIDS", "before we had the life saving drugs that we had now.", "And being asked to do an impossible task.", "But I had to at least operate in that arena", "because that was the only way that we were gonna", "get to where we ultimately did get.", "The results of that saved Larry's life", "and had him live into his 80s,", "which is absolutely remarkable because living with HIV,", "as well as someone who had a liver transplant.", "He was blasting me for not providing immediate relief", "for the people he felt he was responsible for.", "He felt a personal responsibility of saving", "the gay community from this terrible scourge of HIV/AIDS.", "And he was furious at anybody who he thought", "was slowing that process down.", "And those people often were you and I.", "He was angry for me at things that I couldn't possibly do.", "And I think he loved me for things", "that he knew I was trying so hard to do.", "That's what I think he meant by a complicated relationship.", "Tony, I wanna play one more clip.", "Listen to this and then I'll,", "maybe you'll remember when you said it.", "[Tony] A pandemic in its full-blown form,", "it's gonna be, as we said, a very, very difficult situation", "if it happened right now.", "And if it happens tomorrow, in its full-blown form,", "we're in a big hurt.", "If you look at the odds, the odds are", "that it's not gonna be the overwhelming one.", "But you can't go on odds", "when you're trying to prepare a nation.", "As a responsible nation, you have to", "prepare for the worst case scenario.", "It was in 2005.", "And it was, you were talking about the bird flu.", "And it just seems like this is history", "that keeps on repeating.", "Are we gonna walk away from this smarter?", "Well, I hope so.", "People often ask me and I say,", "you're not gonna stop the emergence of a new infection,", "nothing we do will stop the emergence.", "What we can do is prevent the emergence", "from becoming a pandemic.", "So that's what we've gotta do to be able to recognize,", "identify, quickly respond to, so that it doesn't become", "such a game changing phenomenon", "that we're forced to be living through right now.", "It looks like we have a long way to go", "in this pandemic before we go to the movies.", "Are we ever gonna go to the movies again?", "Yes, we are Michael.", "And I'll even buy you a ticket.", "We'll go together to alleviate your anxiety.", "When are we gonna get back to something", "that closely resembles, or is in fact normal as we knew it?", "We're already making doses,", "tens and hundreds of millions of doses, to be ready.", "First, at least in graded numbers, at the end of the year,", "in November, December.", "By the time we get to April,", "we likely will have doses to be able to vaccinate", "anybody who needs to be vaccinated.", "But logistically, by the time you get everybody vaccinated,", "it likely will not be until the third,", "or even the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021.", "So let's say we get a 70% effective vaccine,", "which I hope we will get,", "but only 60% of the people get vaccinated.", "There are gonna be a lot of vulnerable people out there,", "which means that the vaccine will greatly help us", "to pull back a bit on the restrictions that we have now", "to maintain good public health.", "But it's not gonna eliminate things like mask wearing,", "and avoiding crowds, and things like that.", "So I think we can approach normality,", "but I don't think we're gonna be back to normal", "until the end of 2021.", "And we may do better than that,", "I hope so, but I don't think so.", "And I just wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart,", "and for The New Yorker,", "and I think really for everyone who's listening,", "and for millions of Americans,", "because you've done us a tremendous service.", "And we're really grateful for you being out there.", "So thank you.", "Well, thank you Michael, for saying that.", "I really appreciate it.", "Thank The New Yorker Festival for having", "you and me on together again.", "We've been together through an awful lot.", "It's always good to be back", "with my old friend and colleague.", "Okay, I'm gonna take you up on the movies.", "[Tony laughs]", "Will do, will do."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["think", "gonna", "yorker", "wanna", "play", "fauci", "understanding", "activist", "know", "dr",
