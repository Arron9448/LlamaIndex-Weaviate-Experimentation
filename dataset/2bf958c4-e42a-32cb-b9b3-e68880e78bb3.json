They were good friends for several years before they finally let themselves fall in love. \u201cI moved to England in 2017 for a garden residency and met Philip and his twin brother Robin through a mutual friend,\u201d Amy remembers. \u201cHe was only in town for the weekend, but we bonded over our shared sensibility and perspective on architecture, gardens, and life in general. It was a sort of rare, old-fashioned friendship, sending each other books in the mail and meeting for lunch whenever he was in town. We both were preoccupied with other life circumstances, but despite ourselves, we quietly fell in love.\u201d", "Soon after they first got together, they both separately confided in their families that they knew they were going to get married. \u201cI already had a very special family ring from my great-grandmother, so we didn\u2019t fuss too much with a formal engagement,\u201d Amy explains. Instead, they made vows to each other in private, on top of a mountain near Amy\u2019s family\u2019s house in New Hampshire, where they spent their first summer together as a couple.", "When it came to planning the actual wedding, they took a laid-back approach. \u201cAs a florist, I have slight PTSD from so many weddings,\u201d Amy admits. \u201cBut when the pandemic started and borders began closing, it immediately became clear that we needed to rethink our plans to ensure that we could be together. The time we spent in lockdown in London cemented our commitment to one another in the purest ways.\u201d", "In June, Amy had to return to the United States because her visa and passport were both expiring, and Philip had to go back to Switzerland. At that point, they were separated for two months due to the European travel ban.", "In July, they decided to elope in Zurich as Philip was already there, and it was the only place still holding international marriages. \u201cIt meant our families couldn\u2019t be with us, but they were incredibly supportive, knowing the security it would give us,\u201d Amy says. \u201cI definitely cried realizing that my sister and Philip\u2019s twin brother wouldn\u2019t be by our sides. We decided the elopement would be phase one of our wedding, and we\u2019ve promised our parents a party in the countryside when we can all travel to be together.\u201d", "Planning for the elopement involved making their way through the piles of paperwork required in order to be reunited. \u201cI had an interview at the Swiss Embassy in DC,\u201d Amy remembers. \u201cWe had to prove our relationship was genuine and Philip had to write me a a formal invitation to come to Switzerland\u2014something that we ultimately have to get framed.\u201d", "After Amy arrived in Zurich, they had ten days of quarantining together to get reacquainted after having been apart for two months. \u201cIt felt like we took our honeymoon early!\u201d Amy jokes. \u201cI ordered our wedding cake, bought opera tickets and my shoes, made dinner reservations and booked our actual honeymoon all the week before our ceremony. We wanted it to feel special, but also not absurd given the circumstances. It wasn\u2019t a total austerity wedding, but we both already had our suits, we used family rings, and kept it really quite simple.\u201d", "Friends pitched in every step of the way. Molly Zaidman agreed to take photos throughout the day. \u201cShe\u2019s exquisitely talented, and she doesn\u2019t usually shoot weddings,\u201d Amy explains. \u201cOnce she was on board, I knew it would all be fine.\u201d One of Philip\u2019s closest friends, James Beresford, flew from London to serve as the witness. \u201cIf we had gotten married one week later, he would have been restricted from entering,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe were so lucky our wedding date of September 22 ended up being in a lull between the first and second waves.\u201d", "On the actual morning of the wedding, Amy woke up early to go to the farmers\u2019 market to buy flowers for her bouquet and apricot croissants for breakfast. \u201cI would never recommend another bride attempt this, but as a florist, it was the perfect, grounding way for me to start the day. Philip, bless him, had a spare hour in the morning so he filed his tax return, and then went for a swim in the lake with James.\u201d", "The bride and groom got ready together. Amy wore a vintage yellow silk twill suit she found for almost nothing before they even knew that they were going to elope. \u201cIt was such a relief to have something I loved and not have to worry about shopping during the pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt like classic city hall to wear a suit; my grandmother did the same thing when she got married in New York in the 1940s so I didn\u2019t overthink it. Whenever we ultimately have a party for our families, I\u2019ll have my \u2018dress\u2019 moment, but the tailoring felt perfect for Zurich. I love a strong shoulder!\u201d", "She kept her jewelry simple, wearing only a pair of pear earrings that her grandfather gave to her mother. \u201cI love those old photos of brides in pouty veils, it makes it all seem more ceremonial,\u201d she says. \u201cI made mine myself the day before the wedding. I just stitched up some ivory English tulle onto a comb, and it ended up being my favorite part of my outfit.\u201d Her shoes were copper Bruno Magli pumps. Makeup was kept simple and natural, and Amy did it herself. \u201cI tucked my lipstick in my suit pocket for the day and that was that!\u201d", "The groom opted for a dark gray Lanvin suit, a crisp white shirt, gray-blue silk grenadine tie, and a Swiss wristwatch from 1918 that belonged to his great uncle and was a gift from his father. \u201cMy father lent us his own wedding ring for Philip, which was so very special, too,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick out some rings of our own once we can go out shopping in a post-pandemic world, but for now, we\u2019re both wearing family rings.\u201d", "Once they were ready to go, they walked through the old part of the city to the Stadthaus, with onlookers congratulating them every step of the way. \u201cI was completely nervous and excited, while Philip was gorgeously relaxed,\u201d Amy remembers. Once they arrived at City Hall, Amy surprised Philip with generations of family wedding photos. Philip\u2019s mother had helped her round them up from his side. \u201cIt was so special to see our parents, grandparents, and beyond on their wedding days,\u201d Amy remembers. \u201cWe both are suckers for family history, and it was a beautiful way of having them all by our side.\u201d", "The couple took their seats around a board room table with the officiant behind a Plexiglass safety screen, and the ceremony clocked in at just under three minutes\u2014making it a remarkable feat of Swiss efficiency. \u201cThe whole thing was extremely straightforward and Philip joked afterwards that the wedding vows the officiant asked us to repeat might as well have been: \u2018Will you please sign this piece of paper?\u2019 Honestly, it was such a blur of excitement to me that I hardly was aware of what was being said. Luckily, it was in English, but it wouldn\u2019t have even mattered.\u201d Afterwards, they signed the contract and kissed. \u201cWe felt overflowing, unadulterated joy,\u201d Amy remembers. \u201cIt was so succinct a ceremony, though, that we even forgot to exchange rings and had to do it ourselves later in the afternoon.\u201d", "James had organized a video call so their families could tune in to see everything unfold, but they didn\u2019t find out until afterward that they were accidentally on mute, so no one could hear anything. Luckily, they managed to speak with them as soon as it was all over.", "\u201cMy nervous energy melted away into such tender gratitude and love when it was all said and done,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe\u2019d be together, finally, no matter what. Rather than cry during the ceremony, I was weepy afterwards in his arms, knowing that we wouldn\u2019t be separated again. It was the deepest relief we could fathom, and the simplest, purest feeling of happiness we\u2019ve known.\u201d", "After the service, they walked to Spr\u00fcngli, a beloved Swiss confectionary for a champagne toast and cake\u2014a chocolate ganache with a halo of sugar daisies. Amy had been gifted her great-grandmother\u2019s silver cake server to use for their first slice. And there, Amy gave Philip her present to him: a series of letters she\u2019d written to him from over the course of their friendship, but never sent. \u201cI always quietly loved him, even from the very start,\u201d she says.", "The following morning, they took a train to the little village of Soglio in the Alps, where they stayed for a few nights at the Palazzo Salis. \u201cWe count ourselves very fortunate to have been able to elope the way we did,\u201d Amy says. \u201cIn hindsight, it felt almost like a wartime wedding, flinging myself across closed borders to Switzerland to be with Philip. And while it was bittersweet as our families weren\u2019t with us, it also felt beautiful to focus simply on our commitment to each other. There will be a time to celebrate all together again, and oh, how sweet that will be.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Macon", "Alexandra Maco"], "keywords": ["families", "vintage", "family", "suit", "way", "felt", "philip", "elopement", "bride", "love", "switzerland", "took", "remembers", "wore", "amy", "wedding"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
