A free Saturday in the city is special, as my wife Katherine and I usually spend weekends at our cabin on Puget Sound \u2013 so when we stay here, we like to explore. The city is changing so fast that even though we have lived here for 40 years \u2013 the past 30 in a building I designed in the historic district\u2019s Pioneer Square \u2013 there is always something new to see.", "Our urban hike begins in Peter Miller Books just off First Avenue. It\u2019s one of the best architectural bookstores in America and I usually find something to tempt me; most recently it was an extraordinary book of photographs by Yukio Futagawa called Celestial Gardens: Kyoto Imperial Palace and Villa. Then we will call in at the Greg Kucera Gallery, just round the corner, which represents really interesting contemporary American artists such as Anne Appleby and Peter Millett.", "Next is Pike Place Market. Established in 1907, it\u2019s home to some wonderful, family-run shops where the owners always greet you \u2013 so important in today\u2019s big-brand world. We\u2019ll buy salmon for supper at Pure Food Fish Market, then stock up on the city\u2019s best olive oil at DeLaurenti and Brick House Select Pinot Noir and Januik Cabernet Sauvignon at Pike & Western Wine Shop, before visiting Turkish Delight to taste the day\u2019s baklava.", "Back on First Avenue, we split up to go to our favourite clothes stores. Katherine has always been a great dresser and likes the original clothes at Baby & Company. I go to the Jackstraw boutique next door: I like an interesting shirt and these are always beautifully tailored and detailed.", "Le Pichet, a small French bistro, is the perfect place for lunch. It does an excellent omelette and salad. I never drink at lunchtime, but we will treat ourselves to coffee and an apricot oatmeal pecan cookie at Macrina Bakery\u2019s Sodo caf\u00e9.", "Advertisement", "Restored, we\u2019ll then head to South Lake Union. It\u2019s a new \u201ccity within the city\u201d and everywhere you go there are buildings under construction \u2013 including the Wagner Education Center at The Center for Wooden Boats, which my partner Tom Kundig is designing. I find all this development exciting; there is an inherent optimism to living in a city that\u2019s becoming something new.", "We spend the evening at home, grilling the fish and drinking wine on our leafy deck. We live on the top floor of our building and have views that take in the whole architectural history of Seattle.", "Sundays are about relaxation and even when we\u2019re in the city we like to spend the day in the natural world. In the morning I make \u201ceggs in a nest\u201d, a recipe my father taught me where you break eggs into holes in slices of bread and bake them. I\u2019ve made it my own by adding what I find in the fridge, such as last night\u2019s leftover salmon.", "We\u2019ll either head to the Seattle Asian Art Museum, a beautiful art deco building in Volunteer Park with a wonderful collection of historic art, or cross Lake Washington to go to the Bellevue Botanical Garden. Seattle has the best climate in the world for plants and, like everything in the city, this new garden is growing and growing.", "The afternoon always includes a trip to the food lovers\u2019 Metropolitan Market in Uptown. We go for the week\u2019s groceries and maybe some fresh crab cakes for an easy supper. Otherwise, when we get home we walk half a block to Caf\u00e9 Paloma, a one-room Turkish restaurant where we feel part of the family. The lentil soup is so healthy it makes you feel like a better person.", "Advertisement", "After supper, I\u2019ll read The New York Times, look at my calendar to prepare myself for the week ahead and, because Louie needs a bedtime walk, the weekend will finish just as it began."], "keywords": ["city", "world", "spend", "wonderful", "seattle", "market", "building", "olsons", "best", "jim", "art", "weekend", "supper", "walk", "perfect"], "pubDate": null}
