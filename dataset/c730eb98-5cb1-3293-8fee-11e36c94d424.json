But don\u2019t let that overshadow some of the exciting news about Bethesda\u2019s big 2021 releases. We\u2019re particularly excited for Arkane Studios\u2019 Deathloop, which is featured on the cover of Game Informer this month.", "Deathloop is a game about a man stuck in a repeating 24-hour time loop. You play as Colt Vahn, a man trapped on the desolate island of Blackreef who is being hunted by an insane \u201ccult\u201d of mask-wearing lunatics. However, Colt is one of the only people who seems aware of the fact that he is reliving the same day over and over again, and if Colt wants to break this loop he\u2019ll need to orchestrate the assassination of eight extremely powerful individuals.", "As part of our month-long coverage, we\u2019re excited to share this collection of exclusive screenshots. Bethesda has released a few trailers for Deathloop, but these are some of the first screens we\u2019ve seen to date. These images showcase Arkane\u2019s unique 60\u2019s mod style, the near-futuristic tech of Blackreef, and some of the aforementioned masked maniacs. What you won\u2019t see is more on the history of Blackreef or how Colt can tackle any challenge in a multitude of ways. For that you should be sure to read this month\u2019s cover story.", "You can see \u2013 and read \u2013 more on Deathloop by subscribing to the magazine.
