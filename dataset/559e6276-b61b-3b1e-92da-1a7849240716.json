Drivers slope into nearby bars as they wait for their turn. It can take four days to clear customs before the ferry crossing. Fortunately, though, change is on the way. A new bridge will be finished in 2020. The crossing will smooth trade between the four countries that converge on this pinch-point in southern Africa: Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It ought to be a boon for their economies.", "The Kazungula bridge is part of a broader trend towards Africa\u2019s economic integration. In 2020 the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is scheduled to become operational, after receiving the support of 54 out of 55 African countries in 2019. Judged by the number of signatories, the ACFTA is the biggest trading area since the creation of the World Trade Organisation in 1994. It aims to cut tariffs and facilitate trade among its members.", "Its boosters have high hopes. Roughly the same number of people live in sub-Saharan Africa (1bn) as in Asia excluding India and China. But, as John Ashbourne of Capital Economics notes, the average African country\u2019s population is 12m, versus 45m in \u201cemerging Asia\u201d. So there is huge potential for an African trade deal to increase economies of scale on the continent.", "The ACFTA could lead to a single market with a GDP of more than $3trn, about the size of the Indian economy, the world\u2019s fifth-largest. At present just 15% of African exports go to other African countries; the equivalent figures for regional trade in Asia and Europe are respectively 58% and 67%. Because the goods traded within Africa tend to be manufactured ones, rather than the oil and minerals that make up most exports to the rest of the world, the ACFTA could foster African industry, too. Doing so should help domestic manufacturing, which would in turn increase the number of well-paid jobs.", "The new trading area is not the only sign that business is getting easier among African countries. Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian tycoon, said in 2016 that he needed visas to travel to 38 other states on the continent. It is often easier for Westerners to criss-cross Africa than for its own citizens. But things are slowly improving, according to data from the African Union. In 2016 a fifth of African countries did not require Africans to have a visa to enter; two years later the share was a quarter. (In another quarter of countries Africans can get visas on arrival.)", "Yet despite some progress, economic integration in Africa has a long way to go. Implementation of the ACFTA will take years. Even then, it will never be as sweeping as Europe\u2019s single market and customs union. For it is unclear how the deal will interact with other, existing, often contradictory regional trade-deals. Then there are the politics. Many smaller countries worry that regional hubs, such as Kenya and South Africa, will benefit from the deal at their expense. Others, such as Nigeria, are run by leaders who remain protectionist by instinct.", "And cutting tariffs is just a start. As the drivers in Kazungula know well, it is the practical barriers, such as the quality of roads and the number of police checkpoints, between African countries that are often most significant. Studies suggest that the cost of transporting goods by road can be five times higher in African countries than in other poor ones. Red tape at the border only adds to the problem. Though there is progress on visas, some of the biggest economies in Africa, such as Angola, Nigeria and South Africa, still make it fiendishly difficult for other Africans to visit.", "Africa as a whole is not about to make the sort of rapid progress seen by China and, to a lesser extent, India over the past few decades. A continent of 55 diverse countries is unruly in a way that a single country is not. Corruption and patronage politics hold back far too many of them. Growth in Africa may struggle to outpace rising populations, save in notable exceptions such as Ethiopia. So Africans will fall further behind Asians.", "Still, it is encouraging that the central topic of conversation on the continent is commerce and trade. That is a huge shift from the years when talk was dominated by war and conflict. In 2020, as swathes of the world embrace protectionism, African policymakers ought to be applauded for at least trying to make trade easier.", "This article appeared in the Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cCome together\u201d"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["slowly", "draw", "countries", "trade", "number", "world", "african", "way", "acfta", "kazungula", "africa", "africas", "economies", "closer", "africans"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
