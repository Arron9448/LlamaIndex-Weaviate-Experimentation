The star, who comes from an acting family, has successfully made her mark in films, taking on a variety of roles over the years. Richardson is the daughter of Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave, the matriarch of a venerable British acting dynasty that includes her late father Michael Redgrave; her late siblings Lynne and Corin Redgrave; and her children, Natasha Richardson, who died in a ski accident in 2009, and director Carlo Nero.", "\u2018FACTS OF LIFE\u2019 STAR LISA WHELCHEL EXPLAINS WHY SHE DIDN\u2019T RELEASE MORE MUSIC AFTER HER \u201980S SOLO ALBUM", "\u2018JEOPARDY!\u2019 HOST ALEX TREBEK IS LEADING HIS LIFE \u2018WITH DIGNITY\u2019 AMID CANCER TREATMENTS, SAYS ROB BELUSHI", "Richardson spoke to Fox News about working alongside Cage, 56, the biggest challenge that awaited her on set, and whether there was ever a time she felt like giving up on acting.", "Fox News: What surprised you the most about Nicolas Cage?", "Joely Richardson: Well, he's a very good actor and he's sort of become this icon. What I didn't realize is, being a peer of his, was that when I told my nephews and nieces and my daughter that I was working for... In other words, the young generation, people in their twenties. They were like, \"Oh my God, Nick Cage. I love him.\" I didn't realize he has this huge fan base with that age group. I was fascinated because I grew up watching his films...

I found a place, mentally, where I could shut down. Do you know how everyone has different fears like some people are scared of spiders? I'm not scared of spiders, but mine is hours and hours of prosthetics, and I was actually really happy to confirm that, to see that I could do it. I could go through the claustrophobia of having all the masks and the layers, and actually got really into it and took some video essays on it, because it is such a level of artistry that they do. And it was really fun to be an ugly monster, rather than worrying about your lip liner.", "Fox News: What was your relationship like with the cast?", "Richardson: It's interesting. We were shooting in this very freaky house in the middle of nowhere, up a hill in Portugal, and we all felt very cut off from our worlds. A lot of people had come from America.

I was sick when I read the script. I was running a bit of a fever and I was like, \"What? Well, what is this? I don't get it.\" And I was perplexed by it, honestly, but I was also sick and running a fever, and so then I thought, \"Well, Nick is [an] absolutely fascinating actor. Let me see who this director is.\u201d", "So I looked him up, and then I watched the documentary about \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" that he was involved with. And I was like, \"My God, this guy is fascinating.\" Although he can talk about some very extraordinary subjects, there was something grounded about his voice and because of the job I do, I listen a lot to voices, you see. They tell you so much about a person.
