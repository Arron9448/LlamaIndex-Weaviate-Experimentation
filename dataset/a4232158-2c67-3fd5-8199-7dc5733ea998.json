The event quickly went viral; within days, hundreds of thousands of people had clicked the page\u2019s \u201cGoing\u201d button. Although intended as a joke, the event drew very real attention from the US Air Force, which warned the public not to try to enter the site, and from the state of Nevada, which started preparing for a possible tourist invasion.", "Intrigued by the media coverage of Roberts\u2019 prank, photographers Ryan Koopmans and Alice Wexell decided to take a look at this remote patch of Nevada desert for themselves. In August, they spent three days documenting the area\u2019s few residents and their businesses for GQ Australia. What they found was mostly empty ranchland\u2014which is, of course, why the military built the facility there in the first place. In the 1950s, it was the perfect place to test experimental spy planes, which some locals mistook for alien spacecraft.", "\u201cI knew there wasn\u2019t much there, but there was even less than I had imagined,\u201d Koopmans says. The closest town, Rachel, has a population of around 50 people. Other than one alien-themed restaurant and bar, the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, there\u2019s little for outsiders to do\u2014this isn\u2019t Roswell. Most of the residents Koopmans met just wanted to be left alone. \u201cPeople move out there for a reason,\u201d Koopmans says. \u201cThey were nice, but it\u2019s not a super-inviting place.\u201d", "Photograph: Ryan Koopmans & Alice Wexell", "Koopmans and Wexell did convince a local to give them directions to the unmarked dirt road that leads from from Nevada State Route 375\u2014known as the Extraterrestrial Highway\u2014to the edge of Area 51. After exiting the highway, they drove for about 45 minutes until they reached a gate with a No Trespassing sign. A white Ford truck was parked on a nearby mound overlooking the entrance. When Koopmans photographed the truck, it flashed its high beams at him. Only later, while looking at the photograph on his computer, did he realize the truck was empty; a security guard must have triggered the high beams remotely. \u201cThat was a little weird,\u201d Koopmans says.", "In the end, the Storm Area 51 event was a bit of a bust. Roberts tried to capitalize on the attention by announcing an \u201cAlienstock\u201d festival in Rachel, only to relocate the festivities to Las Vegas at the last minute. On September 20, around 40 people gathered at one of the gates to Area 51, where they were dispersed by law enforcement. Only one arrest was made, for public urination.", "Or at least that\u2019s what the authorities want you to believe. Koopmans says he\u2019s encountered UFO enthusiasts online who believe the September 20 raid was bigger than the media reported and that its true size has been suppressed by the government. In other words: The truth may still be out there.", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "title": "The Neveda Town Where Storm Area 51 Sort Of Happened", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/rachel-nevada-area-51/", "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Michael Hard", "Laura Mallonee", "Michael Hardy"]}
