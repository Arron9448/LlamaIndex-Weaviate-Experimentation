A chartered, specially configured aircraft sets out on a two- to three-week itinerary, often around the globe, stopping at world-class destinations along the way, such as Easter Island , Machu Picchu and the Taj Mahal.", "It's not cheap -- most products are for the few that can afford a vacation above the $100,000 mark, although some more \"budget\" options are starting to appear.", "Here's what the travel market looks like for 2020:", "Abercrombie & Kent", "Abercrombie & Kent customers board their transfer to Sandakan.

Then they dialed the glamor up a couple of notches by chartering the Concorde for its globe-spanning air cruises.", "Although the specially configured Boeing 757 it now uses is a tad slower, it's still a very premium piece of kit.", "The two to three air cruises that the tour operator offers each year are limited to 50 passengers and have carefully curated themes focused on culture and the natural world. Prices range from $140,000 to $160,000, so let's just say that most of us will be saving up a while.", "Before each of these cruises, the aircraft, which is owned and operated by an Icelandic airline, has its cabin modified and purpose-fitted to meet Abercrombie & Kent standards.", "Those standards? We're talking a plane equipped with only first-class, lie-flat seats -- no economy moves here.", "When can I go?

Courtesy Four Seasons", "In 2015, the Canadian high-end hotel chain launched its own air cruises.", "A Boeing 757 was also the aircraft of choice for this offering. The jet, painted nose to tail in elegant and eye-catching black, acts as a brand ambassador as it flies around the world, the Four Seasons logo emblazoned on its fuselage.", "Inside, there are 52 lie-flat seats and a cabin that aims to replicate the type of experience Four Seasons hotels provide on the ground.", "It's been such a success that Four Seasons has ordered a new jet, a brand new Airbus A321neoLR, which will enter service in 2021.", "Four Seasons is currently offering four different itineraries during 2020 and three for 2021, each including a diverse mix of destinations such as Japan, the African savannah, Polynesian islands or European cultural capitals.", "When can I go? International Intrigue 2020 takes off from Seattle on February 15, 2020, and finishes in Paris on March 9, 2020.

Deep-pocketed customers can design their customized air cruise itineraries or choose from one of Crystal's signature global journeys.", "When can I go?

It starts and ends in Sydney and stops include Seoul, Jerusalem, Valletta, Barcelona, Cartagena, Machu Picchu and Easter Island.", "The chance to visit destinations that Qantas aircraft hardly ever visit is a strong pull for the airline's crew, resulting in strong competition to be selected for work on this special journey.", "\"The crew loves it. You do the flying, which is always during daytime, then spend a couple of days at an entirely new destination. As an example of the great vibe, we even had some crew members dressing up festively at some of the airports we have stopped at along the route,\" says Dan Kotzmann, Constellation's managing director.", "This once-a-year journey is already scheduled for 2020, but it's unclear whether the Jumbo is going to remain available after that, since Qantas is retiring all its Boeing 747s next year.", "\"We are talking with Qantas to see whether we can do it using another airplane. The reality is that the Boeing 747-400ER that we have been using is a great aircraft: it has the capacity, it has the range, it can land at most airports.
