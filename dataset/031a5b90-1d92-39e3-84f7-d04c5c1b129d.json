Rhetoric about democratic socialism and defunding the police, they said, had scared away moderate voters, who rejected Donald Trump but voted for Republicans down ballot. Abigail Spanberger, who represents the conservative Seventh Congressional District of Virginia, made that argument on a post-election call with fellow House members which was then leaked to the press. She tells David Remnick that the Party cannot achieve anything without bipartisan dealmaking\u2014however unwelcome it may be to progressives. But Ayanna Pressley, who represents the liberal Seventh Congressional District of Massachusetts, doesn\u2019t buy it. In order to prove Democrats\u2019 value to voters, she says, the Party must stand up for ideals and not seek compromise. Pressley feels that a sufficiently populist approach to pandemic relief, for example, can sway Republican voters. \u201cWe know, before the pandemic, [many] families didn\u2019t have four hundred dollars saved to weather a disruptive life event,\u201d she points out. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure many of those families were Republicans. So the ultimate persuasion tool is impact.\u201d"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Dorothy Wickende", "Jelani Cob"], "keywords": ["pandemic", "ayanna", "party", "seventh", "democratic", "abigail", "progressives", "spanberger", "pressley", "represents", "rift", "voters", "families", "republicans", "house"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
