Jessica thought that Matthew, who was baby-faced but muscular, looked rich; he wore Ralph Lauren boots and collared shirts from Hollister. Jessica, who was in tenth grade, was less popular. She wore hand-me-downs and liked to take nature photographs. Her parents had abandoned her when she was three, along with her sister and brother, and she grew up on a farm with her mother\u2019s adoptive parents. \u201cI guess she felt like \u2018Matthew could have picked anybody, and for some reason he picked me,\u2019 \u201d her sister, Dusty, said. Jessica had pale-green eyes, a melodic voice, and blond hair that hung down her back like a slab of wood. In the spring of 2013, when she was sixteen and had dated Matthew for a year, she took her grandparents into the kitchen, closed the door, and told them, apologizing, that she was pregnant. Jessica\u2019s grandparents, who are Baptist, were willing to help her bring up the child, but Jessica decided to settle down with Matthew, her first boyfriend. Her aunt Kathy, who lives on the farm, said, \u201cWith Jessica\u2019s family background, there was probably just a feeling of \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve finally found someone who loves me.\u2019 \u201d Jessica and Matthew moved into a house across the street from the sheriff, Wendell Beam, and his wife. Jessica was the kind of intuitive mother who predicts a baby\u2019s danger\u2014a fall, a spilled drink, a choking hazard\u2014a few seconds before it happens. But she felt isolated. She finished her high-school coursework online, and almost never saw her friends or family. She said that Matthew told her she wasn\u2019t related to them by blood. For their son\u2019s first Christmas, Matthew took Jessica to her grandparents\u2019 house\u2014the first time she\u2019d seen them in months\u2014but before she opened her presents he told her that they had to leave. When Jessica graduated from high school, her grandparents held a party for her and projected a movie on the side of their barn. Shortly after the movie started, Matthew said that it was time to go. \u201cThe rest of us enjoyed her graduation party,\u201d Martha, her grandmother, said. Matthew\u2019s childhood dream was to work in law enforcement\u2014a career inspired by his grandfather, who had helped bring him up following his parents\u2019 divorce. After high school, he worked as a jailer at the Pike County sheriff\u2019s office before being hired as a patrol officer in Griffin, the largest city in Spalding County. In his personnel file there, a supervisor described him as \u201cfiercely loyal\u201d but \u201cstiff and unwilling to bend.\u201d Another officer described him as \u201cthe type who wants to make ten arrests a day if he could.\u201d A senior officer privately advised Matthew, \u201cLighten up a little bit, man.\u201d That mentality spilled into his home life. Twice, Matthew called the police on Jessica, for yelling or cursing or poking his chest. According to a police report, Jessica was \u201cvery reserved and appeared to be upset.\u201d She said that the officers recommended that she not yell at Matthew. In December, 2014, Jessica had a brief affair and got pregnant again. Her family wondered if this was her way of escaping the relationship. But Matthew said that he\u2019d raise the child as his own. They decided to get married. Jessica could never quite explain why\u2014there was no proposal, just an understanding that there was too much momentum to break up. Martha worried that Jessica had \u201clost her feistiness. It was almost like her personality got squished out of her.\u201d Her aunt Denise, a public-school teacher, said that, at the wedding, \u201cthere was just this sadness in her eyes, like, \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201d She had the demeanor of a child who had promised herself not to cause trouble or draw attention to her own feelings. Jessica and Matthew left their wedding reception, which her family hosted, after less than an hour. Matthew wore a titanium wedding ring with a blue stripe, to signify that he was in law enforcement. They rented an apartment in Griffin, in a complex of beige two-story buildings surrounding a swimming pool. But the sheriff still loomed large in their relationship. Matthew asked Beam to phone him in the morning to wake him up. Jessica didn\u2019t have her own credit card or car, so if she needed something from the supermarket she texted Matthew, who either took her to the store himself or asked Beam or his wife to deliver the item. When Matthew drove his patrol car, he would often take the keys to his truck, a Chevrolet Avalanche, so that Jessica couldn\u2019t use it. Cartoon by Roz Chast Denise was on a science-curriculum committee with Matthew\u2019s stepmother, Amy, a teacher in the same district. A few months after the wedding, Denise and Amy went out for lunch. Denise said that Amy confided that Matthew had once hit her and that their relationship was strained. \u201cShe became dead serious\u2014I\u2019d never seen her so serious,\u201d Denise said. \u201cShe said we needed to know what kind of kid he was. She said, \u2018Do me a favor. I want you to make sure that Jessica is going to be O.K., because he\u2019s going to hurt her.\u2019 \u201d", "In the spring of 2016, less than six months after the wedding, Jessica discovered that Matthew was having an affair with Courtney Callaway, a dispatcher at the Spalding County sheriff\u2019s office, a mile away from the Griffin Police Department. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be with me anymore,\u201d Jessica texted him, \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay here and play house.\u201d Matthew, who had begun spending his free days with Callaway, told her, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work for us. I already know it won\u2019t.\u201d Jessica\u2019s grandmother made an appointment with a lawyer who could help her file for divorce. In a composition note\u00ad\u00adbook, Jessica documented the times she assumed Matthew had been with his girlfriend, and she jotted down notes for the lawyer. \u201cDifference between non-\u00adcontested & adultery divorce?\u201d she wrote. \u201cMost important to me. Custody (full?).\u201d She and the boys planned to move into her sister Dusty\u2019s house on Friday, April 15th, and the next week she would begin working at a chiropractor\u2019s office. \u201cShe had both of the boys packed and ready to go,\u201d Dusty said. Jessica had to wean her baby before starting the job, so on Thursday night she and Matthew drove to Walmart, to buy formula. At the store, they got into a fight, and when they left Jessica said she didn\u2019t want to get into the car. Matthew called a Griffin police lieutenant for advice. \u201cShe\u2019s a grown lady,\u201d the lieutenant told him. \u201cYou can\u2019t force her into the truck.\u201d (Matthew refused to comment for this story.) From her porch, Jessica\u2019s neighbor Megan Browning saw Jessica and Matthew return home. A half hour or so later, Browning was lying in bed when she heard a gunshot. Unnerved, she went out to the porch, where she heard another. Not long afterward, she saw Matthew walk briskly to his truck. He drove to a nearby Waffle House to have a late dinner with a fellow Griffin police officer. On his way, at 12:54 a.m., he said, he received a text from Jessica: \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. Take care of\u201d the children. \u201cPlease tell them I love them everyday. I have been suffering for a while now and no one has noticed. Here lately I have not been able to recognize the person I see in the mirror. This is not the first time I have had suicide thoughts. I love you and the boys.\u201d A minute later, Matthew responded to a joke from Callaway. \u201cHaha I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think about that lol,\u201d he wrote. Then he called E.M.S. \u201cCan you please dispatch a unit out to my location?\u201d he said calmly. \u201cIn reference to my wife.\u201d He explained that she was having suicidal thoughts and \u201cshe told me to take care of the boys. So I\u2019m trying to hurry up and get back home, just to make sure that nothing is going to happen to them.\u201d Six minutes later, Matthew reported on his police radio that he had heard two gunshots as he was walking up the stairs to his apartment. He had looked in the master bedroom, and when he didn\u2019t see the baby, who typically slept there, he ran outside. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was an active scenario,\u201d he later told investigators. \u201cI was scared to death, because I couldn\u2019t find him, that she would shoot me, shoot him, and then kill herself.\u201d Eleven Griffin police officers arrived at the apartment complex. With their guns drawn, the officers checked every room in the house. The older boy was asleep in his bedroom, and the baby was in his own room, crying in his crib. The officers found Jessica in her bedroom closet, unconscious and lying on her side, her head on a bloody pillow. She was wearing fluffy slippers. On a shelf by her head was the notebook documenting Matthew\u2019s infidelity. Matthew\u2019s service gun was under her stomach.", "Jessica\u2019s grandparents live on two hundred acres of farmland in Pike County, a twenty-five-minute drive from her apartment. A fence separates their house from an open field, where nine cows and two donkeys graze. Just before 2 a.m. on April 15th, Wendell Beam asked the sheriff of Pike County to send officers to the house. Two deputies woke Jessica\u2019s grandparents and told them that Jessica had committed suicide, using Matthew\u2019s gun. \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t ring right,\u201d Martha told them. Four of her grandchildren had taken target-shooting classes together, but Jessica had refused to participate. \u201cJessica would not touch a gun,\u201d she said. \u201cShe did not want to have anything to do with it.\u201d Dusty and her husband drove to Jessica\u2019s apartment. The first officer she saw in the parking lot was Beam. The sheriff\u2019s department does not respond to incidents inside the Griffin city limits, and he was the only one from his office there. Dusty asked him where Jessica was, and he said that she had been taken by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center. He did not explain why he\u2019d earlier sent word that Jessica was dead. Dusty approached a group of Griffin police officers and asked whether Matthew had shot her sister. \u201cShe loved those kids more than anything, and she knows how it feels to grow up without a mom,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have done that to them.\u201d The officers told Dusty she needed to either calm down or leave the property. The police asked for assistance from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Early that morning, Matthew was interviewed by Chris DeMarco, a G.B.I. agent who lived near Spalding County and had worked with Beam on several cases over the years. DeMarco told Matthew that his clothes might need to be collected as evidence. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to brush off anything. I didn\u2019t try to wash my hands\u2014nothing.\u201d He sounded like an eager student. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about getting any other clothes.\u201d G.B.I. agents canvassed the apartment complex and discovered that Megan Browning and her fianc\u00e9 and a couple that lived next door to Jessica were the only neighbors who had heard gunshots. Both couples said that the shots occurred around 11 p.m.\u2014not at 1 a.m., when Matthew had reported them. One of the neighbors said that, not long before he heard the gunshots, he also heard \u201csome banging, like she was banging on the door or something.\u201d Browning, who sometimes socialized with Jessica and Matthew, cried throughout her interview. \u201cI hope he goes to jail for this shit,\u201d she said. She wanted to elaborate on what she\u2019d witnessed, but the agents left after eight minutes and never came back.", "On a hospital-admission form, Jessica was described as a \u201c19 year old reported to have shot herself in the right skull.\u201d But Vernon Henderson, a trauma surgeon for more than two decades, who treated Jessica, wrote that her injury \u201cdid not fit with that description\u201d; neither of her hands had \u201cany evidence of any gunpowder stippling.\u201d And her wound was on the top of her skull, which suggested that she would have had to hold the gun above her head, pointing downward\u2014\u201ca very unusual direction in which to point the gun at one\u2019s self with the intention of committing suicide,\u201d Henderson wrote. Indentations in the walls of Jessica\u2019s closet suggested that one bullet had been shot at an upward angle\u2014it entered the wall near the top of the closet\u2014and another bullet hit the wall near the floor. Her neurosurgeon, Paul King, told me, \u201cIt seemed most likely that someone else shot her.\u201d Matthew\u2019s wedding ring had a blue stripe, to signify he was in law enforcement. Photograph by Danna Singer for The New Yorker Jessica had an intracranial-pressure monitor inserted into her brain, to measure swelling, and she was put in a medically induced coma. Matthew\u2019s father and stepmother visited the next week. \u201cAmy fell to pieces,\u201d Denise said. \u201cI hug\u00adged her and said, \u2018It\u2019s going to be O.K.\u2019 And she said, \u2018No,\u2019 and looked at her husband.\u201d (Amy did not want to comment for this article, explaining in an e-mail, \u201cI have tried to remain neutral in this very serious situation.\u201d) Matthew and the boys temporarily moved in with Courtney Callaway, the dispatcher he was dating. In Jessica\u2019s first three weeks in the hospital, he visited her once, accompanied by Beam, who wore his uniform and carried his gun. \u201cI made sure that I had another party with me, to insure the accusations wouldn\u2019t be made,\u201d Matthew said later. After the visit, Matthew, who had been placed on administrative leave, was interviewed again by DeMarco. \u201cThe chief would eventually like to get his officer back, as well as his service weapon back,\u201d DeMarco told Matthew. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to try to expedite this as fast as possible, and, when I say expedite, I mean the next few weeks.\u201d DeMarco assured Matthew that his phone, which had been seized during the investigation, would be returned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I told your\u2014That\u2019s what I told the sheriff today,\u201d he said. Shortly after Jessica was hospitalized, her aunt Kathy took a photograph of a C-shaped bruise on the back of Jessica\u2019s head, and she shared it with the G.B.I. agents, asking them to investigate how Jessica had been injured there. She suspected that there had been a physical altercation leading up to the gunshots. Although it\u2019s possible that Jessica\u2019s head hit the wall after she shot herself, there was no blood on the wall or on the clothes in the closet. Only the pillow under her head was bloody. A G.B.I. summary of an interview with King, the neurosurgeon, noted that he called the circumstances of her injury \u201csuspicious,\u201d but the agent who conducted the interview failed to record the conversation; he hadn\u2019t charged his audio recorder. King told me, \u201cYou\u2019d think it would have been simple enough to put bags on her hands and test them for gunshot residue. I was wondering why, but then it came to pass that her husband was a police officer and his granddaddy was the sheriff, so I understood.\u201d", "Matthew and Callaway broke up a few weeks later. In an interview with the police, she said that she found him intimidating. \u201cI know that he\u2019s a police officer, and I\u2019m not really anybody,\u201d she said. In early May, after three weeks in a coma, Jessica began to regain consciousness. She silently surveyed the walls, where her family had taped pictures of her sons. A few days later, Kathy noticed Jessica crying. She was watching a cartoon about a lion. \u201cSomething had happened to the mama lion\u2019s cubs,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cThey were hurt.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s my baby?\u201d Jessica asked, once her breathing tubes were removed. A nurse told her she\u2019d been in an accident. \u201cLike a car accident?\u201d she asked. The nurse didn\u2019t answer. Jessica\u2019s recovery was so swift that people at the hospital called her the \u201cmiracle child.\u201d Although her skull had been fractured, neither bullet had penetrated it. Less than a week after Jessica emerged from her coma, DeMarco and another G.B.I. agent, Jared Coleman, interviewed her as she lay in her hospital bed. It was the first time anyone had spoken with her at length about the night of her injury. \u201cCases like this\u2014we don\u2019t usually have someone to talk to like you, because you\u2019re not here,\u201d Coleman told her. \u201cRight,\u201d she said, nearly whispering. Her voice was hoarse from the breathing tubes, and she seemed childlike and dazed, as if her only goal was to accommodate the agents as quickly as she could. She said that all she could remember about that night was that she\u2019d gone to Walmart. The G.B.I. agents asked if she had ever handled Matthew\u2019s gun. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t even get it out of the case,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t sure how to unlock the safety lever on the holster. \u201cHe asked me to go get it out before, and I told him, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to.\u2019 \u201d \u201cHave you ever had any thoughts about hurting yourself?\u201d Coleman asked. \u201cNo. Never,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially because of my children.\u201d She started crying. \u201cI\u2019ve never, ever wanted to hurt myself before.\u201d \u201cDo you think Matthew was \u00adincapable of doing this?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that y\u2019all would have to figure out.\u201d The G.B.I.\u2019s theory of Jessica\u2019s shooting depended on her being suicidal, but she gave no indication of being depressed. Although the hospital had placed her under constant observation after she was admitted, the precautions were removed after she regained consciousness. Had she attempted suicide, it would have been standard for the hospital to provide psychiatric care. But a psychiatrist who assessed her for depression apparently saw no need to give her a diagnosis or refer her for treatment. A second psychiatrist thought she had \u201cappropriate mood and affect; appropriate judgment and insight.\u201d Her surgeon, Henderson, wrote that she was \u201ca very positive person who is embracing the opportunities that a new lease on life afforded her by her recent recovery.\u201d He went on, \u201cShe has a sense of humor and has a gentle and calm personality. She speaks lovingly of her children and the need to and desire to see them.\u201d \u201cOf course, it was through my efforts that we landed that account, but did I get any credit? Ha! Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d Cartoon by Nick Downes", "After Jessica had been in the hospital for a month, her doctors tried to transfer her to a rehabilitation program, but she didn\u2019t have insurance, so she was discharged to the care of her grandparents. She walked with a limp and struggled with headaches, short-term memory lapses, ringing in her ears, and numbness on the left side of her body. Three days after she left the hospital, a deputy from the Pike County sheriff\u2019s office delivered a Family Violence Protective Order. Jessica could not come within three hundred yards of Matthew or her children. According to the order, which Matthew had petitioned the court to issue, \u201cprobable cause exists that Family Violence has occurred in the past and may occur in the future.\u201d Jessica was ordered to have a psychological evaluation. At a family-court hearing that June, Matthew asked that the protective order be extended for a year. Matthew, who had been restored to patrol duty, carried a new service gun and wore his uniform, and was accompanied by Beam. \u201cWe have an individual that is a parent that attempted to take her own life,\u201d his lawyer, Lance Owen, told the judge. \u201cSomebody that shoots themself in the head means business. And if she\u2019s capable of attempting to take her own life, there\u2019s a chance that she might do something to these children.\u201d Matthew testified that Jessica\u2019s grandparents were \u201cnot blood-related,\u201d and could not be trusted with the children. \u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t believe that she did this to herself\u2014I think they\u2019re not taking it seriously,\u201d Owen said. \u201cHave you spoken to her doctors about what they believe is the cause of her head injuries?\u201d Jessica\u2019s lawyer, Bree Lowry, asked. Henderson, the surgeon, had written Lowry a letter stating that \u201cwhatever investigation there was done into this event in no way reflected our observations in the emergency room.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only concerned with the G.B.I. reports,\u201d Matthew said. Lowry wanted to put witnesses on the stand who would testify that Matthew had been psychologically abu\u00adsive. \u201cWe believe he is a danger to her,\u201d she told the judge, Tommy Hankinson. \u201cOne witness\u201d\u2014Jessica\u2019s neighbor Megan Browning\u2014\u201cwould like to speak to you anonymously in chambers, because she is afraid.\u201d Judge Hankinson seemed to find the idea so novel as to be humorous. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had that one before,\u201d he said. \u201cIs she gonna wear a mask or\u2014\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ve got the right to confront and cross-examine anybody that\u2019s gonna be offering testimony,\u201d Owen said. \u201cGood for you, Mr. Owen,\u201d Hankinson replied. \u201cI\u2019m glad to know there\u2019s still advocacy in the practice in the courts of the Griffin Judicial Circuit.\u201d No one ended up testifying about Jessica and Matthew\u2019s marriage. In the past thirty years, the criminal-justice system has become more responsive to domestic violence, but family courts have been largely insulated from this cultural change. In an analysis of more than two thousand family-court opinions from the past decade, Joan S. Meier, a professor at George Washington University Law School, found that, in sixty-four per cent of cases, courts did not accept the story of a mother who said she or her children had been abused by her husband, even when evidence corroborated the claim. \u201cThere is an unwillingness to believe, as if it\u2019s just preferable not to know this about our culture,\u201d Meier told me. She has found that courts are rarely willing to hear evidence about a form of abuse called \u201ccoercive control\u201d\u2014a crime in England\u2014which describes the process by which people are dominated, sometimes to the point that they are no longer free agents and cannot make decisions without a partner\u2019s permission. \u201cThe idea that domestic violence is bad for kids still has not sunk in\u2014it sometimes barely makes a dent in a case,\u201d she said. Few states mandate that custody evaluators have domestic-violence training; judges often characterize the allegations as mudslinging and focus not on their veracity but on which party appears to be the better parent. \u201cThe judges are very swayed by their own reactions to each person,\u201d Meier said. She found that, when a mother accused a father of domestic abuse or child abuse, she lost custody to the father in twenty-\u00adeight per cent of cases. When the roles were reversed, fathers lost custody in only twelve per cent of cases. Hankinson briefly paused during the hearing to see if any statutes said that attempted suicide was a form of child endangerment. He didn\u2019t find any, and dismissed the protective order. But he granted full custody to Matthew. Jessica could see her children for only four hours on Sunday afternoons. Owen proposed that Beam supervise the visits. \u201cSheriff Beam can carry a weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she is capable of, Judge.\u201d Jessica\u2019s family agreed to pay a hundred dollars every Sunday so that her visits could be observed by another armed law-enforcement agent. At the judge\u2019s recommendation, they also arranged for a psychological evaluation. Jessica\u2019s only diagnosis was \u201cacute stress disorder,\u201d which, the evaluator wrote, occurs \u201cwhen an individual is exposed to actual or threatened death.\u201d The evaluator added that her \u201csymptoms are normal and to be expected through circumstances such as hers.\u201d Two months later, Jessica was hired as an assistant teacher at a child-care center in Griffin. Ashley Dunn, the lead teacher in Jessica\u2019s classroom, said, \u201cWe were all, like, \u2018You can do an awesome job working with ten two-year-olds but you can\u2019t see your own kids?\u2019 \u201d On weekends, Dunn sometimes asked Jessica to babysit for her own children.", "In September, 2016, the G.B.I. closed its case, concluding that Jessica\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted. Her DNA had been found on the gun, which was to be expected\u2014she had been lying on it. Neither Matthew nor Jessica had been given a gunpowder-residue test. The agency deferred to its chief medical examiner, who spent ninety minutes on the case and never examined Jessica. He concluded that Jessica had shot herself in the head, though he indicated that his assessment would have been more definitive had there been a photo of Jessica\u2019s wound before she\u2019d had surgery. The G.B.I.\u2019s report never mentioned the picture of Jessica\u2019s bruise that Kathy had given the agents. The agents who wrote the report seemed indifferent to the dynamics of Jessica and Matthew\u2019s marriage, as if the subject were a private matter that didn\u2019t merit discussion in an official investigation. They recorded interviews with eight Griffin police officers, some of whom Matthew considered good friends; one informed the agents that Matthew \u201cwas telling me how she kind of acts crazy sometimes when she don\u2019t get her way.\u201d The G.B.I. did not record any interviews with Jessica\u2019s family or friends. Although police departments have become more attentive to officers\u2019 use of excessive force against civilians, the same scrutiny has not been applied to their potential for violent behavior at home. In the nineteen-nineties, researchers found that forty-one per cent of male officers admitted that, in the previous year, they\u2019d been physically aggressive toward their spouses, and nearly ten per cent acknowledged choking, strangling, or using\u2014or threatening to use\u2014a knife or a gun. But there are almost no empirical studies examining the prevalence of this sort of abuse today. Leigh Goodmark, the director of the Gender Violence Clinic, at the University of Maryland\u2019s Carey School of Law, speculates that one reason for the dearth of research is a reluctance to fund a study that will bring attention to an uncomfortable dilemma: that, as Goodmark says, \u201cthose policing the crime and those committing it are often the same person.\u201d \u201cI think the city thought this would be business as usual, until a local reporter and a loser truck driver got involved,\u201d Will Sanders said. Photograph by Danna Singer for The New Yorker At the Griffin Police Department, concerns about domestic violence have apparently been so slight that in 2018 the department hired an officer whose personnel record showed that he had recently been accused by his child\u2019s mother of threatening her with a gun. In many other cities, domestic violence seems to be treated as similarly insignificant. This year, an independent panel found that the typical penalty for New York City police officers found guilty of domestic violence\u2014some had punched, kicked, choked, or threatened their victims with guns\u2014was thirty lost vacation days. In nearly a third of cases, the officers already had a domestic-violence incident\u2014and, in one case, eight\u2014in their records. In the Puerto Rico Police Department, ninety-\u00adeight police officers were arrested for domestic violence between 2007 and 2010; three of them had shot and killed their wives. Only eight were fired. Last summer, the sheriff of Los Angeles County, Alex Villanueva, articulated a common justification for not con\u00adsidering domestic violence as a concern: in defending his decision to employ a deputy who had been accused of stalking and physically abusing his ex-girlfriend, he told a local reporter that it was \u201ca private relationship between two consenting adults that went bad.\u201d The violence was seen as unrelated to job performance, an activity that could be understood only within the context of a relationship. But the factors that lead to abuse at home\u2014coercion, authoritarianism, a sense of entitlement to violence\u2014are also present in the work that police officers do on the streets. It should not be surprising that domestic abuse appears to predict excessive use of force\u2014a link that scholars have suggested should alter the way that departments respond to both kinds of aggression. The Citizens Police Data Project, in Chicago, analyzed the records of Chicago cops between 2000 and 2016 and found that officers accused of domestic abuse received fifty per cent more complaints than their colleagues for using excessive force. Philip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University and one of the few scholars who has studied the issue, reached a similar finding: one in five officers arrested for domestic violence nationwide had also been the subject of a federal lawsuit for violating people\u2019s civil rights. The Griffin Police Department had not received any complaints about Matthew\u2019s use of force, but Darrell Dix, a former lieutenant, told me that he and some of his colleagues worried that Matthew had a domineering and \u201cone-\u00addimensional\u201d approach to his work, which could provoke \u201cfights and scuffles.\u201d \u201cHe had not learned that there is a human side of this, too,\u201d Dix said. \u201cIt was \u2018I\u2019m going to lock people up. I\u2019m going to do it my way.\u2019 \u201d", "Jessica\u2019s shooting was the subject of hushed conversations among Wendell Beam\u2019s staff at the Spalding County sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cIn all my years in law enforcement, when someone shoots himself in the head it\u2019s one and done,\u201d Jessica Whitehouse, a deputy there at the time, told me. There\u2019s no second shot. \u201cEveryone said, \u2018Beam\u2019s grandson will get off,\u2019 \u201d she went on. \u201c \u2018Nothing will happen to the kid.\u2019 \u201d Before being elected sheriff, in 2011, Beam had worked in the sheriff\u2019s office for thirty-seven years. He had a reputation for being kind and personable but also passive, indecisive, and resistant to change. When female officers told him that they were afraid of the patrol-division captain, David Gibson, whom Beam had promoted, he did nothing. Gibson routinely said to female colleagues, \u201cShut your cock garage.\u201d He told a secretary that she should wear a cowbell around her neck, so he\u2019d always know where she was. Gibson had worked in the sheriff\u2019s office for twenty-eight years, and he cultivated an aura of invincibility. He claimed to have personally insured Beam\u2019s election. He spoke about how he gambled with a mythical figure known in the sheriff\u2019s office as the Wood Chipper, because, supposedly, he had used such a device to kill a woman. A deputy named Misty Piper said that, after Gibson repeatedly pressured her to have sex with him, she acquiesced, because she felt that, if she defied Gibson, she would meet a similar fate. Twice, she later testified, Gibson choked her. In 2012, Piper complained to Beam, and he said he\u2019d look into the accusations, if she put them in writing. \u201cAnd then I started thinking, Well, why did I even come to you?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not well connected with anyone.\u201d She decided to resign instead. The following year, Gibson put a female colleague in a headlock and held a Taser against her temple. \u201cGet off of me!\u201d she screamed. A male sergeant saw the exchange and told Beam, who provided Gibson with what he called \u201cundocumented counselling.\u201d Two years later, Gibson slapped a secretary on the back of the head, telling a male officer, \u201cI\u2019m gonna show you how we take care of these secretaries.\u201d Although the secretary complained to Beam about Gibson\u2019s behavior, Gibson was never disciplined. In late 2014, Whitehouse, one of the youngest deputies in the sheriff\u2019s office, scheduled a meeting with Beam to say that Gibson\u2019s treatment of female cops was demeaning. She told me that, for female officers in many parts of the South, \u201cthere\u2019s no in-between\u2014you can\u2019t just be a human in uniform.\u201d They were made to feel that their presence contaminated the ethos of the department. \u201cIf you perceive yourself as being country and rough, then you\u2019re a dyke,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do wear makeup and fix your hair, you\u2019re a whore.\u201d Beam asked Whitehouse to meet him at a park on the outskirts of Griffin. Whitehouse didn\u2019t understand why she was being directed to \u201cbasically a hiding spot.\u201d She recorded the conversation on her phone, so that investigators could look for clues if she disappeared. \u201cHe had control of Spalding County,\u201d she said, referring to Gibson. \u201cHe was Spalding County. Anybody that went against him would be eliminated.\u201d Whitehouse said that Beam seemed concerned, but he said that she\u2019d have to write down her complaint. Like Piper, Whitehouse was afraid to follow through. Beam dropped the matter. \u201cI figured she was going to retract her statement,\u201d he said later. (Beam refused to talk to me.) After several months, a male officer told a captain in Internal Affairs that he didn\u2019t understand why Whitehouse\u2019s complaint had been ignored. At the recommendation of the captain, and with Beam\u2019s approval, an outside agency investigated Gibson and concluded that he was a \u201cpredator.\u201d In the spring of 2015, Beam allowed Gibson to retire, keeping his pension. The secretary whom he\u2019d slapped in the head was asked to type his resignation letter. \u201cIt was like he was spitting in my face,\u201d she said. (Through his lawyer, Gibson told me that the headlock-and-Taser incident was \u201call in good fun\u201d; most of the other allegations were \u201cuntrue and are otherwise embellished.\u201d) After Gibson left, citizens came forward to say that they, too, were terrified of him. One woman said that he would drive to her house and shine the lights of his patrol car into her windows. Then he would \u201chandcuff me and put me on the hood of his patrol car and have oral sex with me,\u201d she wrote in a statement. \u201cI was going to report this, but, like he said, who will they believe?\u201d Another woman, who used methamphetamine, said that sometimes Gibson followed her as she drove. He would flash his lights and pull her over, and force her to have sex with him. She was sure that if she didn\u2019t comply he would arrest her. As it became clear that Gibson\u2019s activities could be criminal, the G.B.I. looked into the allegations. In an audio-recorded conversation, an agent expressed disbelief that Beam had let Gibson\u2019s behavior continue for so long. \u201cWhy is he getting so much protection and coverage?\u201d the agent said. \u201cThis blows my mind.\u201d", "In December, 2016, Jessica filed a report with the Griffin Police Department, saying that Matthew hadn\u2019t returned her belongings. After she came out of her coma, Denise had had to buy her new clothes. Jessica was still missing her orthodontic retainer. Matthew signed a sworn statement promising that he no longer had anything of Jessica\u2019s. Matthew was now dating Shelby Willey, a young mother who had recently separated from her husband. They moved in together in January, 2017, and as they were packing Willey discovered that Matthew had a large gym bag full of women\u2019s clothes, along with a retainer with \u201cJessica\u201d printed on its case. When Willey asked Matthew about it, she said, he told her he intended to burn the bag, which Jessica had packed one night when she was planning to leave him. Willey had seen a copy of Matthew\u2019s sworn statement in his car, and she was disturbed that he was \u201clying straight to everybody\u2019s face,\u201d she later told the police. (She and Callaway, Matthew\u2019s ex-girlfriend, couldn\u2019t be reached for this story.) Jessica, at home with her three boys, still has occasional migraines, weakness in her left foot, and lingering amnesia about the night of her shooting. Photograph by Danna Singer for The New Yorker In a private Facebook message, Willey complained to a friend that Matthew\u2019s demeanor was \u201cemotionless but very authoritative.\u201d She had learned about Jessica\u2019s shooting after probing stories were published by Sheila Mathews in The Grip, a free newspaper in Spalding County, and aired on the Atlanta television station 11Alive, reported by Brendan Keefe. When she asked Matthew about the shooting, \u201cnothing adds up,\u201d she wrote to another friend on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s always different. It\u2019s always more exaggerated every time.\u201d She felt uncomfortable that Matthew told Beam \u201cevery detail of his life,\u201d but that the conversations \u201cwere all confidential.\u201d In May, 2017, they broke up. Willey contacted Jessica on Facebook and warned her that Matthew was not taking good care of the children; they were subsisting, she said, on cheese puffs, Fudge Rounds, corn dogs, and Mountain Dew, and sleeping at odd hours. \u201cIt breaks my heart!\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and tell you that the boys deserve more structure and more care and love which I\u2019m almost positive YOU have.\u201d By then, the boys were spending half their time with each parent, switching houses on Fridays. Willey wanted to help Jessica because she was scared of Matthew, too. \u201cIt felt like he was just a ticking time bomb,\u201d she told the police. \u201cHe never let me go anywhere without me sharing my location with him.\u201d She said that, when they talked about what happened to Jessica, \u201che laughs about it. He thinks it\u2019s funny. And he said, \u2018It\u2019s a damn shame she didn\u2019t do it right the first time.\u2019 \u201d She added, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t refer to her as, like, human. Like, he talks about her as if she\u2019s nothing.\u201d As Willey was moving out of Matthew\u2019s house, she again came across the gym bag of Jessica\u2019s clothes. She notified a local truck driver named Will San\u00adders, who had a reputation as a \u00adfreelance investigator. Sanders was forty-three years old and the son of a former Republican state representative; he considered himself a happy beneficiary of the \u201cgood-old-boys system,\u201d he told me, and did not do his work in pursuit of po\u00adlitical reform. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hobby,\u201d he said. \u201cIt in\u00adterests me on a psychological level.\u201d He had conducted his own canvass of Jessica\u2019s apartment complex; retraced Matthew\u2019s journey to the Waffle House, timing the drive with a stopwatch; and got permission from the new tenants of Jessica and Matthew\u2019s apartment to inspect the holes in the closet. He had filed nearly a hundred Open Records Act requests about Jessica\u2019s shooting, and he shared what he learned with Jessica\u2019s family, as well as with The Grip. Jessica\u2019s grandmother, Martha, said that initially she had trusted Wendell Beam, whom her husband had known for years, and the G.B.I.\u2019s investigative process. \u201cI\u2019ve always been such a firm believer in our just\u00adice system,\u201d she said. \u201cI would fight you tooth and nail defending it.\u201d But, af\u00adter receiving thousands of documents from Sanders, Martha stopped driving through Griffin, because she was afraid. Sanders said, \u201cI think the city thought this would be business as usual, until a local reporter and a loser truck driver got involved.\u201d Sanders offered Willey a hundred and twenty dollars to sneak into Matthew\u2019s utility closet and get Jessica\u2019s bag. She agreed, and in May, 2017, Sanders dropped off the bag at the Griffin Police Department.", "Matthew was called in for questioning. At first he lied, but within fifteen minutes he acknowledged that he\u2019d known about Jessica\u2019s bag all along. \u201cWhy did you write the damn statement?\u201d a sergeant asked him. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t give a sworn statement and lie on it.\u201d Crying, Matthew set his body armor, badge, and police radio on the table in front of him, and agreed to resign from the department. In July, he was charged with two felonies: making false statements and violating his oath of office. Philip Stinson, the professor at Bowling Green, maintains a database of officers who have been arrested around the country, and he said that, in response to the Lautenberg Amendment, a federal provision that was passed in 1996 and prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms, cops accused of domestic violence are often charged with lesser offenses, as a kind of \u201cprofessional courtesy,\u201d so they can continue working. \u201cThat\u2019s the game here,\u201d he said. Jessica found it darkly funny that it was a missing retainer, and not her brain injury, that ultimately led to Matthew\u2019s arrest. Mike Yates, the chief of the Griffin police, told me in an e-mail that Matthew\u2019s case had nothing to do with domestic violence. \u201cWe will not be swayed by hearsay, false rhetoric or sensationalism in a manner that would cause harm to the innocent,\u201d he wrote. In April, 2018, nine months after Matthew was charged, Jessica called the Spalding County district attorney\u2019s office to ask why Matthew\u2019s case hadn\u2019t been presented to a grand jury. She was told that, to prove that a crime had been committed, the district attorney needed to establish that the oath of office had been administered to Matthew. But a Griffin city official said that the document couldn\u2019t be found. Mathews, the publisher of The Grip and its only reporter, submitted an Open Records Act request to the magistrate\u2019s court, where judges swear in new officers. Within three hours, she received a copy of Matthew\u2019s official oath, which the D.A.\u2019s office had been trying to find for six months. The next day, Yates texted the D.A. to say that he had the original document. Matthew\u2019s case was presented to a grand jury in July, 2018. Under Georgia law, police officers, unlike civilians, have the right to make a prepared statement at the end of a grand-jury hearing. There is no public record of the proceeding, but the grand jury chose not to indict Matthew either for making false statements or for violating his oath. Four months later, he was hired as a reserve officer in Braswell, Georgia, a community of four hundred people.", "Jessica\u2019s grandparents wrote letters to the G.B.I., the governor, the city manager, and the district attorney to request that the investigation into Jessica\u2019s shooting be reopened. By then, Beam\u2019s reputation had been muddied by the Gibson investigation, and he had been voted out of office. Jessica\u2019s grandparents hoped that this development would help their case. The new sheriff, Darrell Dix, the former lieutenant in the Griffin Police Department, told me that when he unlocked the doors to the sheriff\u2019s office on his first day on the job, January 1, 2017, he found nine industrial-sized trash bags full of shredded papers. Jail trusties\u2014model inmates who did menial jobs at the sheriff\u2019s office\u2014told him that they\u2019d spent two weeks destroying paperwork, at the previous administration\u2019s instruction. \u201cThey had wiped stuff off the computers,\u201d Dix said. \u201cThey had even taken notebooks off shelves and shredded the documents.\u201d Dix was one of the Griffin police officers present the night that Jessica was shot. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the findings of the G.B.I.,\u201d he told me. But, he said, \u201cthere are a lot of questions out there\u2014both in favor of Jessica and in favor of Matthew\u2014that could be answered, but I just don\u2019t think the G.B.I. is going to do it.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe only two people who know the answers are Jessica and Matthew,\u201d and Jessica will never be a reliable source, given her traumatic brain injury, and Matthew\u2019s account can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cI guarantee you he won\u2019t a hundred per cent say what happened,\u201d he said. (Matthew\u2019s lawyer said, in an e-mail, \u201cThe ultimate aim of both the GBI\u2019s investigation and the grand jury\u2019s inquiry was to find the truth. And in both instances, he was cleared of wrongdoing.\u201d) That Matthew had found himself in a troubled relationship did not surprise Dix. \u201cBad decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cHardheaded. Wouldn\u2019t listen to anybody.\u201d No one responded to Martha\u2019s letters. She concluded that she\u2019d chosen the wrong tactic. \u201cAt the time, I was well known in my field by people who had some clout\u201d\u2014she worked in hospital risk management and had friends in law enforcement\u2014\u201cand what we should have done is pulled some strings,\u201d she said. She felt she needed men in power on her side if she were to challenge a culture in which men let other men get away with what they please. Will Sanders, the truck driver, reached a similar conclusion. In July, 2018, he criticized Yates on the department\u2019s Facebook page for denying Sheila Mathews, The Grip\u2019s publisher, access to public information\u2014behavior that, Sanders said, was part of a pattern of intimidating female reporters. Yates had lost his previous job, in 2014, as chief of the police department in Jonesboro, Arkansas, after he called a local reporter \u201csmelly\u201d and said that dealing with her was \u201clike trying to pick up a dog turd by the \u2018clean end.\u2019 \u201d She resigned, citing the \u201clevel of stress and anxiety created by a public official who commands a small army.\u201d Within two hours of Sanders\u2019s Facebook comment, Yates informed San\u00adders that his private Facebook messages would be made accessible to \u201cany persons interested in the entire scope of your actions, activities, motives and history.\u201d He added, \u201cThis material will be released in the interest of transparency and context.\u201d The department had obtained the messages a year earlier, as part of the investigation into Jessica\u2019s gym bag. (The purposes of such a sweeping request were never clear. To obtain the search warrant, a lieutenant submitted a sworn statement explaining that there was probable cause that Sanders had been involved in two commercial burglaries; later, the lieutenant said that this was the result of a cut-and-paste error.) Sanders deleted his Facebook account, his primary method of communicating with sources and reporting his findings. He had once assumed that if he dug deeply enough he would understand not only Jessica\u2019s shooting but the reasons that David Gibson had been protected for so long. Although Gibson had been indicted on fourteen charges, he was allowed to plead guilty, in June, 2017, to only two, for violating his oath of office, and he was granted first-offender status. After he serves a three-year sentence and finishes his probation, his record will be wiped clean. \u201cOh, O.K. I can sort of see it.\u201d Cartoon by Benjamin Schwartz For a time, Sanders thought that the source of Gibson\u2019s power might be connected to the Dixie Mafia (a gang based in the South), or a gambling ring, or some hidden knowledge that afforded him a lifetime of leverage over Beam. But now he resorted to a more mundane theory about the culture of power. \u201cMy mama told me stories about going to lunch with my father and his friends in the sixties,\u201d he said to me. \u201cThe men would sit down, and the women would stand behind their men. When the men wanted tea, they just shook their glasses.\u201d Even Gibson\u2019s lawyer, Phil Friduss, seemed at a loss to explain whether Gibson had controlled the county, as so many people believed. \u201cI hope those stories went too far,\u201d he said, referring to the notorious Wood Chipper. The inability to pinpoint the source of Gibson\u2019s dominance\u2014and of Beam\u2019s capacity to shield other men\u2014seemed only to feed the drama and paranoia. Eleanor Attwood, a lawyer representing six women who filed civil suits against Gibson, warned me to do all my reporting when the sun was out. Sanders said that he no longer goes anywhere unarmed. If he has to drive to downtown Griffin, he cleans and vacuums his car, so he can easily see if someone plants drugs or contraband. For a while, he put clear tape on the doors of his house and car, so he would know if anyone had sneaked inside. Jessica gave him her old cell phone and notebook, and he keeps them in a safe at a location that he won\u2019t disclose, along with a shrink-wrapped box containing all the documents he collected. \u201cMy dream is that, one day, the Feds show up and say, \u2018We want the notebook,\u2019 \u201d he said. But otherwise, he said, \u201cI\u2019m done\u2014I\u2019m out. They have won. I hold up the white flag.\u201d"], "pubDate": null, "id": "9139a6f8-a0e1-3e04-8c24-5330ceecc580", "keywords": ["told", "officers", "griffin", "abusive", "matthew", "asked", "jessicas", "jessica", "husband", "cop", "beam", "matthews", "gibson"], "title": "What if Your Abusive Husband Is a Cop?", "summary": "Matthew asked Beam to phone him in the morning to wake him up.\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have done that to them.\u201d The officers told Dusty she needed to either calm down or leave the property.\n\u201cThe chief would eventually like to get his officer back, as well as his service weapon back,\u201d DeMarco told Matthew.\nAt a family-court hearing that June, Matthew asked that the protective order be extended for a year.\nWhen she asked Matthew about the shooting, \u201cnothing adds up,\u201d she wrote to another friend on Facebook.", "authors": ["Rachel Aviv", "Alice Munro", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Jelani Cobb", "Rachel Louise Snyder"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
