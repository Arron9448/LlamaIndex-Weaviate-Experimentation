It\u2019s a dreamy start to a career in fashion, but Belhumeur, now the creative director of Californian label Vince, remembers her time at Kingston University for a different reason.", "\u201cDaphne Brooker [the college\u2019s head of fashion for three decades and a former Vogue model] hated me,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a mohawk and I used to walk around in Doc Martens, long skirts and heavy belts that bruised my hips as they were so studded. I don\u2019t think she understood what I was about. Calvin saw through it! I was the bee\u2019s knees after that.\u201d", "Today Belhumeur is casually but elegantly put together in a cream blouse and pleated silk skirt from her own collection, and it\u2019s hard to believe she was ever a punk. Vince has garnered cult status in recent years and nobody embodies its low-key luxe better than the woman at its helm. Belhumeur only joined Vince in 2017 (after a 10-year stint at Club Monaco), but her impact already shows.", "A go-to for elevated, understated everyday pieces \u2013 and firm favourite for cashmere since it was established in 2002 \u2013 Vince retains its original brand values. But Belhumeur has refined them. \u201cPeople have a soft spot for Vince because the pieces can live in your wardrobe for ever,\u201d she explains, walking me through the airy headquarters in Hollywood. The corporate suits of the company, I\u2019m told, are strictly relegated to the New York office. This is a creative, open-plan space where brainstorms, mood boards and fabrics take priority.", "\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting our customers to be like, \u2018Oh, this is the new season, you\u2019ve got to get rid of last season.\u2019 It is season-less, so you can layer on or de-layer,\u201d Belhumeur continues. \u201cI don\u2019t buy a whole new collection each season, I wear the same stuff from Vince from even before I joined. It\u2019s just a way of styling yourself. I don\u2019t like the idea of a woman trying to figure out how to put herself together for hours in front of the mirror each morning. It has to feel natural, and I think Vince allows that to happen.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It has to feel natural\u2019: Vince\u2019s AW19 collection. Photograph: Andrea Matarrese", "The biggest challenge for Belhumeur, who was born in Gloucester but relocated to Los Angeles from New York last year, is re-establishing Vince\u2019s Californian roots. This, she believes, is integral to connecting with the target customer. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other contemporary luxury brands with a designer approach in California. It\u2019s mostly surf brands or boho. So it\u2019s a wonderful lifestyle message we can get across. This woman who enjoys luxurious fabrics, like silk and cashmere, but wears them in a relaxed way. She is still very sure of herself, but her attitude is more effortless.\u201d", "Belhumeur may have creative free rein, but sprinkling rays of Cali sunshine over everything from the photography on the e-commerce site to the interior design of 50 physical shops worldwide is no mean feat. \u201cOnline is easy. It\u2019s like, \u2018This is the story we\u2019re telling,\u2019 we can make changes that are immediate and gratifying,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe stores are more of a challenge\u2026 looking at an old store and being, like, \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t want to see it like this!\u2019 But you have to be patient.\u201d", "On the recent agenda was an in-store magazine championing Californian artists, writers and filmmakers, and the unveiling of Vince\u2019s flagship London store, for which she has sourced 1970s furniture, \u201cso it will feel like somewhere you want to hang out.\u201d It\u2019s an approach tested by the brand\u2019s Palisades store, which hosts Shibori tie-dye classes as well as craft workshops. \u201cYou want it to be a place where people can chill,\u201d she says.", "If her decade at Club Monaco (the Ralph Lauren-owned casual Canadian brand) is anything to go by, the future of Vince is in safe hands. \u201cWhen I joined Club Monaco in 2008 there was a great love for the brand, but it had gone off course and lost its way,\u201d she explains. \u201cOver the years I was able to put that back together and reinvent it, but still keep the core of what it started off as.", "\u201cIn the 1990s, everyone was still wearing colour, patterns and big shoulders from the 1980s,\u201d she continues. \u201cClub Monaco was simple clothing for people who didn\u2019t want to wear that. It was very black and white. It was a place I would go to in the 1990s in New York because I\u2019d want a black cardie or a white cotton shirt. There was nowhere to get them other than the more expensive Maison Margiela or Helmut Lang, which I couldn\u2019t afford.\u201d", "The Vince woman is very sure of herself, but her attitude is effortless", "Before Club Monaco and after Calvin Klein, Belhumeur worked for menswear brands in New York and then launched her own men\u2019s line for British label Fenn, Wright and Mason. \u201cThat\u2019s where I started going on trips to Asia and India and learning about sweater layouts in factories,\u201d she says. \u201cI also got to work in a lot of Italian mills on fabrics. Fitting men\u2019s clothes is a very precise thing, so I learned all about tailoring.\u201d", "By the time she went freelance and started a family in 1995, Belhumeur and her artist husband, Christopher, considered \u201ca run-down Victorian house\u201d in Westchester County, an hour-and-a-half north of New York City \u2013 their home. \u201cWe had no money and three kids running around, smashing into walls and jumping on the furniture. But I loved having that time with them.\u201d", "Selling it last year might have been \u201ca bit of a wrench\u201d, but Belhumeur sounds taken with her new home on the east side of the Hollywood Hills: \u201cThe pace is a little slower. It makes me think, \u2018Why was I running around so much like a crazy woman?\u2019 I was talking to my daughter about how people show off about how hard they work in New York, as if it\u2019s something to be proud of. In LA, people are proud of saying, \u2018I got away with working only this many hours today!\u2019\u201d", "On a typical day, Belhumeur will rise at 6.30am for an hour-long hike in nearby Griffith Park before driving to the office. She may feel an affinity with her current surroundings because they remind her of where she grew up. \u201cI was in the deepest countryside, which as a teenager I hated, because I wanted to go and see my friends and they were miles away,\u201d she says.", "It was an outdoorsy but crafty upbringing. Belhumeur\u2019s father was a pilot who was always travelling and returning home with blankets from Morocco and Spanish dolls, and her mother \u201cwas always making things\u201d. Often dragged to the local haberdashery shop, Belhumeur was taught to yarn and knit by her mother, which was more proactive than the career advice she got at school.", "\u201cI told them, \u2018Well, I like art,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Maybe you could do cake decorating or something like that.\u2019 It was only when I looked through the college prospectus and saw Kingston had a free trip to Paris at the end, I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do that then.\u2019\u201d Like Vince itself: so simple.", "Vince, 169 Draycott Avenue, London SW3 (vince.com)", "This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
