To which I can only say I look forward to their tweets of shock when next Wednesday\u2019s lunch features turkey and brussels sprouts \u2026 I wrote to the leader\u2019s office warning it would be \u2018an act of catastrophic political folly\u2019 to vote for the election, and set out a lengthy draft narrative explaining why we should not go along with it.", "\u201cI argued that the single issue of Brexit should not be enough to give Johnson a five-year mandate to enact his agenda on every issue. Instead, I said we should insist on a referendum on his proposed deal, to get the issue of Brexit out of the way before any general election.\u201d", "She blamed pro-leave colleagues in the shadow cabinet for having insisted on backing the election that Johnson wanted, which resulted in Labour losing a net total of 59 seats.", "Corbyn told the Guardian at the outset of the campaign that he had made the decision to support an election himself. Describing a shadow cabinet meeting, he said, \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said, Yes Jeremy.\u201d", "Since last week\u2019s disastrous result, some Labour MPs have called for the next leader to be someone from the north or Midlands who is not strongly pro-remain to help win back trust in Labour heartlands that went Tory in some cases for the first time.", "Caroline Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat, has said Long-Bailey and Nandy are the only candidates worth considering for that reason and accused Thornberry of insulting voters in the north, which has caused Thornberry to threaten to sue her for \u201cmaking shit up\u201d.", "Addressing such concerns, Thornberry, who is MP for Islington South, said: \u201cThe question is how we fight back from here. The answer is certainly not to have some great ideological debate between left, right and centre. Neither is it to set this up as a battle between leave or remain, north or south, and indeed men or women. When did we stop being for the many, not just half of us?\u201d", "She said the goal should be strategic thinking and a proper plan for the future rather than simply aiming to earn raucous cheers at a rally.", "Describing her time opposite Johnson as his shadow while he was foreign secretary, Thorberry claimed she \u201ctook the fight to him every day and pummelled him every week\u201d so that his mask slipped to expose a \u201cmendacious, lazy, dangerous charlatan, unable to hide behind the tiresome smokescreen of bluster he usually relies on\u201d.", "\u201cSo when the Labour leadership contest begins, whoever is standing \u2013 and I hope to be one of the candidates \u2013 the first question shouldn\u2019t be about their position on Brexit, or where they live in our country,\u201d she said.", "\u201cThe first question should instead be: what\u2019s your plan for taking on Boris Johnson over the next five years? And do you have the political nous and strategic vision to reunite our party, rebuild our machine, gain the trust of the public, give hope to our declining towns and smaller cities, and never again waste the opportunity to take back power?\u201d", "She said the prize was being able to focus on Labour\u2019s priorities over more than a century of helping the elderly, housing, the unemployed, and alleviating child poverty.", "Starmer, a fellow north London MP, set out his pitch for the leadership in the Guardian on Tuesday, without confirming he would definitely run.", "He called for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result and acknowledged Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d nor deal sufficiently with antisemitism.", "Both Thornberry and Starmer have served in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet, alongside Long-Bailey.
