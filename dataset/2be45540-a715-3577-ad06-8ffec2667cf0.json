Yet the compositions of the peace delegations from Afghanistan reveal that women are barely considered as worthy of having a say. It is this knowledge and the memory of the Taliban rule in the 1990s that make me fear for the future of Afghan women.", "My pessimism proved correct. On Nov. 9, a few weeks after I returned to Kabul from Doha, I received a call informing me that my name was on \u201cthe hit list.\u201d Several journalists and rights activists had been assassinated in October. Some more were killed in November.", "About 200 female journalists in Afghanistan stopped going to work, and 50 journalists, including 15 female journalists, had to leave Afghanistan. According to Nai, a nonprofit group that supports Afghan journalists, of the 1,900 female journalists who were working in the country in January 2020, about 200 had left the profession by November. After I received the call about the threat to me, I took the extremely painful decision to leave my family and my country, and seek safety elsewhere.", "In November, gunmen attacked Kabul University and killed at least 21 students; it was not clear who was responsible. Fear and confusion took over Kabul. All we could be certain of is that the killings of journalists and civil society activists were deliberate and organized.", "The Afghan authorities are not competent to investigate and prove culpability, the Taliban have denied they are responsible for these killings, and no one knows whether \u201cthe hit list\u201d really exists or who created it. Yet the Taliban\u2019s enmity toward the media is no secret. In 2016, the Taliban threatened to kill Afghan journalists if they continued their \u201cunfair coverage\u201d of the group. They carried out their threat and killed seven journalists working for Tolo TV.", "The Taliban have a long history of using assassinations to heighten the sense of insecurity among the people. The inability of the Afghan government and security forces to stop such attacks exposes their failures.", "The Taliban have come close to achieving their goals through the use of force and military supremacy. After the United States concluded it couldn\u2019t win the war in Afghanistan, even after two decades of fighting the Taliban, it entered into negotiations with them last year. That decision offered the Taliban greater legitimacy than they had ever enjoyed."], "authors": ["Farahnaz Forotan"], "keywords": ["hope", "afghan", "leader", "taliban", "killed", "journalists", "female", "lost", "kabul", "afghanistan", "working", "took", "country", "women", "opinion", "met"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
