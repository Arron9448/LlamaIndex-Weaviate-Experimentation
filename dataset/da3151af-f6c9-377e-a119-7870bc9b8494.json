In an era when chefs are increasingly optimizing their food for maximum Instagram posts, STTK pushes in the opposite direction: their creations are intentionally unwieldy, messy, and hard to encapsulate in just a few characters. Their intuitive recipes unfurl with no event horizon in sight, making their dishes almost impossible to recreate. Still, the imperfect aesthetic has resonated online, cutting through the noise of unicorn food and sickly sweet sundaes.", "Spiral Theory\u2019s upcoming dinner party is in collaboration with Los Angeles-based food arts non-profit Active Cultures, which posits that food is a vital form of cultural production, and aims to explore the historical underpinnings that arise from this approach. Active Cultures grew from a conceptual dinner party series titled The MSG Club, which was first founded by artist Glenn Kaino and L.A.-based chef Niki Nakayama, and hoped to cut through nostalgia and familiarity to introduce new foods to their dinner guests, potentially (perhaps hopefully) sowing a bit of discomfort in the process. So STTK designed a menu around \u201cfood fears\u201d for this New York City edition of MSG Club\u2014specifically the phobias of two special guests at the dinner party: curator Rujeko Hockley, who is currently the Assistant Curator at the Whitney Museum, and director and puppeteer Frank Oz (you might know him as Miss Piggy, Cookie Monster, or Yoda). Hockley has an aversion to papaya, and Oz has a distaste for cucumber. So papaya balls encased in rose water gelatin were added to the menu, along with a cucumber dish that proved intimidating: STTK set cold-press juiced cucumber in the shape of a frozen ball gag to create a dish that\u2019s quickly becoming one of STTK\u2019s signatures. \u201cThere\u2019s salt pickled sakura petals, or cherry blossoms, floating in there too,\u201d Menuez says, as well as a ribbon running through it, so you can tie the frozen juice ball around your head for the full effect (Oz, though he tried, couldn\u2019t seem to stomach it). STTK also created a towering fountain centerpiece that set the table with some other fear-inducing kitchen elements, like broken plates, egg shells, and mounds of dirt. \u201cWhen people taste our food, they\u2019re like, \u2018What the fuck is in my mouth?,\u2019\u201d Okoyomon says. I experienced this firsthand\u2014the dinner guest next to me became convinced, after eating a buzz button cocooned inside the rose water gelatin, that she was allergic to it. She couldn\u2019t figure out where the stinging sensation came from. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite thing,\u201d Okoyomon says. \u201cYou can\u2019t place it and you don\u2019t know how you got there. It might be something that you eat that night and you remember it later at two in the morning, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Fuck, my stomach feels crazy.\u2019 Yeah, it\u2019s because we fucked with your gut.\u201d"], "summary": "Their intuitive recipes unfurl with no event horizon in sight, making their dishes almost impossible to recreate.\nStill, the imperfect aesthetic has resonated online, cutting through the noise of unicorn food and sickly sweet sundaes.\nSpiral Theory\u2019s upcoming dinner party is in collaboration with Los Angeles-based food arts non-profit Active Cultures, which posits that food is a vital form of cultural production, and aims to explore the historical underpinnings that arise from this approach.\nSTTK also created a towering fountain centerpiece that set the table with some other fear-inducing kitchen elements, like broken plates, egg shells, and mounds of dirt.\n\u201cWhen people taste our food, they\u2019re like, \u2018What the fuck is in my mouth?,\u2019\u201d Okoyomon says.", "id": "da3151af-f6c9-377e-a119-7870bc9b8494", "title": "Spiral Theory Test Kitchen Wants to Change the Way You Taste", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "pubDate": null, "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/spiral-theory-test-kitchen-queer-cooking-collective"}
