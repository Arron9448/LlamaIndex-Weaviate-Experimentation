Through tears, my father told me I needed to take the job and hold on to the good memories. On my first day at work, I FaceTimed my parents from my new office. I could see the Hollywood sign. My name was on the door. Perhaps my father took this as permission to go. One week later, my mother called. He\u2019d fallen into a rapid decline.
