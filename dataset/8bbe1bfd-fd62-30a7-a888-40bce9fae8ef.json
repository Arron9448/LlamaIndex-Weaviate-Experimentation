Porto is of course synonymous with wonderful port wine and all the famous port producers are here, such as C\u00e1lem, Sandeman and Ferreira, so a visit here would not be complete without a tour of one of them. You\u2019ll learn about this fortified wine\u2019s fascinating history and its close British connections. Port is made from grapes still pressed in the traditional way \u2013 by feet \u2013 then lovingly matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you\u2019ll get the chance to sample various port styles at the end of our visit. After lunch on board we enjoy a guided tour of Porto. Strategically overlooking the Douro as it empties into the Atlantic, Portugal\u2019s second largest city was originally a Roman town, but its wealth derived from its knowledge of the sea routes to India, with fortunes made from trading spices, silks and other fine goods. Our tour unveils some of its major and more surprising sights. You\u2019ll have the rest of the afternoon to explore the truly fascinating city; so perhaps return to the terraced streets of the old town and wander the sloping maze of winding, cobbled alleyways, soaking up the atmosphere whilst stopping to admire the lovely architecture, soaring bell towers, fine baroque churches, golden rooftops and beautiful tiles of this slice of traditional Portugal. Stop for a drink in a cosy caf\u00e9 and be tempted by an array of delicious cakes and pastries \u2013 perhaps sample a pastel de nata, the traditional Portuguese custard tart. This evening, enjoy a final dinner on board expertly served by our restaurant staff under the supervision of the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. Afterwards, perhaps settle into the lounge to chat into the evening and reflect on the splendours of the remarkable River Douro \u2013 over a glass of port, of course."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["elegance", "youll", "visit", "river", "douro", "whilst", "ms", "tour", "cruise", "porto", "traditional", "port", "enjoy", "salamanca", "town", "course"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
