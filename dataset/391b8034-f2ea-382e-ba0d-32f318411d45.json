She represents the US Virgin Islands, a territory that does not have a vote in Congress, meaning that she was not permitted to vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment on the House floor.", "\u201cVirgin Islanders are always looking for space to be part of this America and try to make it better, even without a vote,\u201d Plaskett told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that their voice and the voice of people from territories representing 4 million Americans \u2013 Puerto Rico and other places \u2013 are actually heard.\u201d", "The multiracial lineup of prosecutors is all the more resonant because they are detailing the actions of a mob that included white nationalist groups and flaunted regalia such as the flag of the Confederacy, which fought a civil war to preserve slavery.", "Jamie Raskin speaks during the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump in the Senate at the US Capitol on 10 February. Photograph: AP", "And the rioters\u2019 objective was to overturn an election that Trump lost specifically by nullifying votes cast by people of colour, most of which went to his opponent, Joe Biden.", "Kurt Bardella, a senior adviser at the Lincoln Project, a group that campaigned for Trump\u2019s defeat, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be lost on anyone that the prosecution of Donald Trump and his white nationalist allies is being conducted by a very diverse group of Democrats encompassing gender, ethnicity and even religion.\u201d", "On Wednesday it fell to Plaskett to remind senators that when Trump was asked to condemn the Proud Boys and white supremacists, he said: \u201cStand back and stand by.\u201d The group adopted that phrase as their official slogan and even created merchandise with it that they wore at his campaign rallies.", "She also recounted how, on September 11, 2001, she was a member of staff at the Capitol and she might have been dead if the fourth hijacked jet that day had plunged into the Capitol, as it was believed to have been planned, instead of being taken down by heroic passengers and crashing into a field in Pennsylvania. She drew a line from that day to 6 January 2021.", "\u201cWhen I think of that and I think of these insurgents, these images, incited by our own president of the United States, attacking this Capitol to stop the certification of a presidential election,\u201d she said, enunciating each syllable, then pausing before adding, \u201cour democracy, our republic.\u201d", "In those days Plaskett was a Republican and later worked in the Department of Justice in the administration of George W Bush, converting to become a Democrat in 2008, and winning a place in Congress in 2014.", "Stacey Plaskett speaks at a press event in Washington DC on 21 May 2020.

At the heart of all of this is the systematic effort by the Republican party to disenfranchise voters of colour and to disqualify legal votes cast by people of colour in this country. That is at the epicentre of this entire conflict.\u201d", "The impeachment managers have made a blistering start as they seek to demonstrate that Trump was \u201cinciter-in-chief\u201d of the deadly violence at the US Capitol. They have used the former president\u2019s own rally speeches and tweets to show that he spent months pushing \u201cthe big lie\u201d of a stolen election and urging his supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d.", "But it remains extremely unlikely that they will get the 17 Republican senators they need for a conviction. The trial is likely to be another case study in how far apart the two major parties have grown. Despite some notable gains among voters of colour last year, Republicans have only one Black senator: Tim Scott of South Carolina.", "LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: \u201cThe diversity on the Democratic side is reflective of America: more inclusive, more diversity of thought. My grandmother used to say, the GOP [Grand Old Party] has built their castle on sinking sand. Their entire existence has been centred around white male privilege and lack of accountability for white men of means.", "\u201cSo the visual on their side shows it is not reflective of America, only a particularly elite class in America. The second distinction is the argument. Trump\u2019s defence team haven\u2019t even met the standard of mediocrity, in my opinion. They have been absolutely awful. I do think that\u2019s indicative that white men have literally never had to fully defend themselves.\u201d"], "authors": ["David Smith"], "keywords": ["reflect", "plaskett", "trump", "white", "trumps", "diverse", "managers", "colour", "seek", "impeachment", "america", "trial", "senators", "capitol", "persuade", "think", "unlike"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
