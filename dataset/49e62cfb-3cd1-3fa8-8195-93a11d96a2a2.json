For the wedding, Taylor originally planned to wear her grandmother\u2019s champagne-color satin gown, but she changed course after spotting a black, floral embroidered Oscar de la Renta gown online by chance. She describes it as \u201cultraconservative and traditional in silhouette, but unexpected in an upbeat black.\u201d This style mantra is how the bride approached her own registry, with a minimalist mindset and a neutral color palette, but also with moments of color and fanciful, nostalgic prints\u2014a nod to Coco Shop, the Antiguan-born boutique that Taylor currently oversees and helped revitalize in 2019.", "\u201cI love bright whites, gold hardware, and clean lines\u2014probably something quite minimal, but with lived-in qualities: old paintings, soft pillows, and things passed down through generations and brought home from different trips,\u201d the bride notes. Naturally, she looked for guidance from her mother when putting together her registry. \u201cI wanted her expertise when it came to what lasts and what she has treasured most in her kitchen and homes,\u201d explains Taylor. This idea of a generational connection rings true throughout the registry. \u201cI grew up with Bernardaud Naxos dinnerware, so they remind me of home. I\u2019m excited that our future kids will grow up with them too,\u201d she says. A set of Royal Limoges dinner plates were an easy complementary addition. Says Taylor: \u201cGray fits all seasons and I loved their gold trim. I only wear gold jewelry and prefer gold knobs and hardware. They just fit.\u201d Upgraded glassware was equally important, but here she opted for a more maximalist character to complement the classic decor pieces. \u201cMy husband and I currently drink everything out of beer glasses with New York sports teams on them and neither of us are New York sports fans, so I cannot wait to receive these Macchia su Macchia glasses,\u201d she says.", "While a Le Creuset kettle may seem like a traditional registry choice, for Taylor, it was inspired by a personal connection. \u201cI fell in love with green tea while visiting my brother when he lived in Japan,\u201d she says. \u201cI registered for the kettle to begin making more of it at home.\u201d Similarly, \u201cfor our wedding, my mother gifted me white linen napkins with my initials embroidered on them in white. They are gorgeous, feminine, and classic, and these placemats from Los Encajeros will be the perfect pair to complement them.\u201d For future brides, Taylor only has two words of advice: \u201cGo timeless.\u201d"], "authors": ["Julie Tong"], "keywords": ["embraces", "vogue", "personal", "registry", "wear", "wedding", "traditional", "york", "white", "unexpected", "gold", "style", "bride", "taylor", "timeless"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
