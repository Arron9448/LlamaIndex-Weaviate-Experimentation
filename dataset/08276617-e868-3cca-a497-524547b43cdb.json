Just as those fledgling fans are figuring out what loyal Yakuza players have known for more than a decade, Yakuza 6 comes along and upends it all. The latest entry in the series may mark the end of Kiryu\u2019s tale, but don\u2019t worry; Sega gives The Dragon of Dojima the sendoff he deserves.", "Without getting too deep in the weeds, Yakuza 6\u2019s story centers on Kiryu\u2019s adopted daughter Haruka Sawamura, who is struck by a hit-and-run driver early on. She was holding a child at the time of the event, and that child\u2019s identity is paramount to the overall arc. The long story is told through an abundance of cutscenes, but I was engaged throughout. Players who are concerned about jumping into the finale without having played through all the other games shouldn\u2019t worry, either. While the story is complicated, it\u2019s largely self-contained. The game cleverly provides context for the important players in the world, and in rare instances when a cameo or reference didn\u2019t click for me, I never felt lost.", "The story provides broad motivations, but much of the Yakuza 6 experience is about making your own way through the world. Between Kamurocho\u2019s familiar neon playground and the comparatively calmer Onomichi in Hiroshima prefecture, Yakuza 6 gives you plenty to do. The two locations are a joy to explore, and they\u2019re brimming with optional activities. Kiryu has a lot of time on his hands, and I looked forward to every opportunity to keep him busy. Many of the missions provide rewards that feed into two of your biggest diversions; the people you help often want to join your baseball team or help take down gangs in your new Kiryu Clan. I\u2019ve spent my fair share of time in Yakuza\u2019s batting cages, and it was satisfying to show off my skills while managing my own crew of sluggers. I didn\u2019t find the clan missions (which are basically tower-defense, minus the towers) quite as interesting, but I was still compelled to complete them all.", "The brawler-style combat feels satisfying, whether you\u2019re swinging your fists or whatever random props you can grab, and I appreciate little touches like the way terrain affects how you take down goons. Getting into scraps is quick, too, which encouraged me to seek out encounters even near the end of my adventure. Dragging enemies into stores, where the battles continue, is particularly fun \u2013 probably because I didn\u2019t have to worry about picking up the mess. Thanks to a reworked leveling system, I leveled up abilities and unlocked moves the way I wanted, rather than having to work my way around a preset ability grid. All these little elements help deliver an exhilarating sense of freedom.", "One of my favorite things about Yakuza 6 is that it delivers surprises at such a steady clip. Kiryu\u2019s quest has life-and-death stakes, but he\u2019s pretty much down for whatever along the way. If you\u2019re interested, you can spend countless hours in side missions and other activities, including spear-fishing, babysitting, and chatting up ladies online. Japan\u2019s citizens have their share of issues, too, which don\u2019t necessarily involve gang warfare. I was eager to lend a hand to everyone who needed help, partially because the rewards can be great, but also in large part because these side missions are so delightfully strange. More importantly, it\u2019s a blast. A typical Yakuza 6 session \u2013 if such a thing exists \u2013 can include darts and karaoke, before concluding with a goofy quest to retrieve an engagement ring from an errant robotic vacuum. The game does a great job in delivering both a meaningful and emotionally resonant story, as well as some of the weirdest, silliest stuff I\u2019ve seen in a long time.", "As fun as it all was, I\u2019m still sad to see Kiryu off. He leaves the series on his own terms, and the conclusion is a fitting tribute to the character. One of the things I\u2019ve liked most about him is how he remained decent, even though his lifestyle frequently put him into contact with decidedly less decent folks. Heck, one of the game's lengthiest mission chains is focused on making friends with all the patrons at a bar. Kiryu approaches the bizarre situations he encounters with grace and empathy, while also bringing a righteous rage when necessary. I\u2019ll certainly miss Kiryu, but we clearly haven\u2019t seen the end of Yakuza."], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["series", "yakuza", "kiryus", "way", "players", "review", "life", "missions", "help", "dragons", "worry", "conclusion", "fiery", "ive", "kiryu", "song"], "pubDate": "2018-04-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
