You seem caught between two worlds\u2014the world of the sick, and the world of the \u201cwell enough to go to work.\u201d In your second draft, commit to a point of view.", "Subject: Out sick", "Hi team,", "Apologies, but, unfortunately, I have to take a sick day today. Sorry, again.", "The repetition of your apologies introduces doubt. Let\u2019s be cognizant of subtext. Are you apologizing for being sick, or for something more nefarious, like not being sick?", "Subject: Taking a sick day", "Hi everyone,", "I\u2019m not feeling well, so I\u2019ll be taking the day off to rest. I\u2019ll be available on mobile and e-mail if needed, but please note that there may be a delay in my response.", "Thank you for understanding.", "This draft is so lucid and coherent, it raises the question: Is this how a sick person sounds? This character is meant to be so ill as to be physically unable to attend work. In your next draft, plumb the depths of what that means. Show us a fight to communicate in the face of illness and despair.", "Subject: Me today", "All,", "Not feeling so good. Will be OOO.", "The conciseness here communicates a powerful sense of urgency, and there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s left off the page. Is it vomit? Diarrhea? Both? You leave us to wonder\u2014an effective tool, no doubt. However, the directness comes across as aggressive. Remember, your goal is to convince your readers that you\u2019re a sympathetic and approachable character.", "Subject: Tummy issues", "Heyy,", "My tum is achy and I tossed and turned all night :( Will be unavail.", "There is such a thing as a narrator that\u2019s too sympathetic. When writing autobiographical prose, you must depict yourself as a complex human being, not a one-dimensional baby. Don\u2019t court sympathy with tawdry tricks like frowny faces. Reveal the ugliness inside of you. Your readers will connect to your brave authenticity.", "Subject: [no subject]", "Been throwing up green bile all mroning and the back of my throat has that mucus-y sick taste. Won\u2019t be in today. Will check in later.", "Bold choice with the absence of a subject line and greeting. Other writers couldn\u2019t pull this off, but it works beautifully here. Also, the credibility typo is a nice detail. However, as a storyteller, your job is to package unsavory details into a narrative, not simply regurgitate them. One approach helps your readers understand sickness; the other just makes them sick.

I know I suggested \u201cunder the weather,\u201d but, seeing it now in context, I don\u2019t think it works.
