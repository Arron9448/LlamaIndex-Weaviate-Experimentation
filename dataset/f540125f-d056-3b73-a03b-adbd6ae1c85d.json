On a recent morning, Talley rang up the designer in Los Angeles for a bicoastal discussion, beginning with Ford\u2019s new cinematic foray: Nocturnal Animals. The film, both written and directed by Ford, won\u2019t hit theaters until November 23, but we\u2019ve been given a sneak preview courtesy of Ford himself. \u201cI\u2019m creating a work that says, to me, what America is, and when Europeans often think of America, they think of Farrah Fawcett in her red swimsuit with her perfect teeth and her big hair,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to think certain things are beautiful, but if we look, things around us that we think maybe are not so beautiful, at first, can become incredibly beautiful.\u201d Of course, when Ford isn\u2019t challenging the notion of accepted beauty standards on-screen, he\u2019s rewriting the rules on the catwalk. Case in point: For his recent Fall 2016 ready-to-wear showing, he cast a host of women in their 40s, namely Carolyn Murphy and Amber Valletta, to strut alongside the likes of 20-somethings including Gigi Hadid and Binx Walton. \u201cI love an adult woman,\u201d Ford says. \u201cThere\u2019s something different that happens with all that experience in the way you carry yourself and the way you walk.\u201d", "As for whippersnappers looking to glean experience in the fashion industry, Ford has these words of advice to offer young interns: \u201cWork hard, do whatever it takes, sweep the floor, pick up pens, never say no, be quick, be fast. You\u2019re not going to just jump in designing a collection\u2014you\u2019ve got to be around it, you\u2019ve got to learn.\u201d According to Ford, the worst thing happening in fashion today is neither \u201cdecorated nails\u201d nor \u201cnudity at noon,\u201d as Talley might suggest. \u201c[It\u2019s] when you see people completely decked out in a look from the runway head to toe, because you can\u2019t see any of their own character or personality coming through, and it actually makes me sad,\u201d Ford says. \u201cI want to go over and talk to those people, make sure they\u2019re okay, because they don\u2019t have a strong sense of identity.\u201d Tune in to hear the full conversation between Talley and Ford, including the results of an impromptu round of word association with terms ranging from glamour and sexy to jaguar and elephants.
