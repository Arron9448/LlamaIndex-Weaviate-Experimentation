Whether it was vanquishing The Covenant with friends in Halo 3 or testing the boundaries of my relationship with my partner in Heave Ho or Moving Out, great co-op games have a way of amplifying the magic of the medium when shared with loved ones.

This is the type of activity that will have you yelling back and forth as you stumble with what you want the other player to do in conjunction with your movement.", "It Takes Two releases on March 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC."], "authors": ["Video Editor", "Alex Is Usually The Largest Nerd In The Room", "Literally", "Has A Deep-Rooted Passion For Video Games", "Movies", "A Good Beer.
