Neither Klopp nor the first-team squad were consulted over the controversial move.", "FSG\u2019s handling of the embarrassing episode has also attracted fierce criticism from supporters and led Jamie Carragher, the former Liverpool player who is now Sky Sports pundit, to claim it has no future at Anfield. No one from the Boston-based company put their name to statements announcing Liverpool\u2019s participation in, and then withdrawal from, a super league project. The only people quoted were the Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer, the Real Madrid president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, and Juventus\u2019s chairman, Andrea Agnelli. There was no apology from FSG initially but, in a video recorded for the club on Wednesday morning, Henry took full responsibility for the damage caused.", "\u201cI want to apologise to all the fans and supporters of Liverpool Football Club for the disruption I caused over the past 48 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes without saying but should be said that the project put forward was never going to stand without the support of the fans. No one ever thought differently in England. Over these 48 hours you were very clear that it would not stand. We heard you. I heard you.", "\u201cAnd I want to apologise to J\u00fcrgen, to Billy [Hogan, chief executive], to the players and to everyone who works so hard at LFC to make our fans proud. They have absolutely no responsibility for this disruption. They were the most disrupted and unfairly so. This is what hurts most. They love your club and work to make you proud every single day.", "\u201cI know the entire LFC team has the expertise, leadership and passion necessary to rebuild trust and help us move forward. More than a decade ago when we signed up for the challenges associated with football, we dreamed of what you dreamed of. And we\u2019ve worked hard to improve your club. Our work isn\u2019t done. And I hope you\u2019ll understand that even when we make mistakes, we\u2019re trying to work in your club\u2019s best interests. In this endeavour I\u2019ve let you down.", "\u201cAgain, I\u2019m sorry, and I alone am responsible for the unnecessary negativity brought forward over the past couple of days. It\u2019s something I won\u2019t forget. And shows the power the fans have today and will rightly continue to have.", "The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.", "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing this horrible pandemic has clearly shown, it\u2019s how crucial fans are to our sport and to every sport. It\u2019s shown in every empty stadium. It\u2019s been an incredibly tough year for all of us; virtually no one unaffected. It\u2019s important that the Liverpool football family remains intact, vital and committed to what we\u2019ve seen from you globally, with local gestures of kindness and support. I can promise you I will do whatever I can to further that.\u201d", "FSG has made a habit of backtracking and apologising for controversial decisions during its ownership of Liverpool. Executives performed a U-turn over plans to hike ticket prices in 2016 following a mass walk-out of fans at Anfield and after receiving a barrage of criticism for looking to furlough some staff at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The former chief executive Peter Moore also issued an apology when an attempt to trademark the city of Liverpool\u2019s name was rejected by the Intellectual Property Office."], "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "keywords": ["club", "project", "forward", "football", "disruption", "league", "work", "hours", "apologises", "w", "super", "john", "henry", "liverpools", "liverpool", "fans"], "pubDate": "2021-04-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
