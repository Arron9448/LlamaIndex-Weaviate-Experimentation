The entreaty is not merely a suggestion. For decades, registering for the Selective Service\u2014the federal agency that keeps a roster of America\u2019s 18- to-25-year-old men, in case a military draft returns\u2014has been a legal duty males must fulfil within 30 days of their 18th birthday.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Potential consequences are not light: denial of student loans, disqualification from citizenship, fines reaching $250,000 and up to five years in prison.", "A new petition to the Supreme Court challenges a broad carve-out to this rule. By requiring men (and transgender women) to register for the Selective Service, but exempting women (and transgender men), the plaintiffs say, the federal government is involved in invidious gender discrimination barred by the constitution.", "National Coalition For Men v Selective Service System revisits a 1981 ruling that upheld the Selective Service\u2019s sorting by sex. That judgment, Rostker v Goldberg, came when women could not serve in combat roles. \u201cRostker\u2019s fundamental premise is no longer true,\u201d the plaintiffs say. \u201cIn 2013, the Department of Defence lifted the ban on women in combat\u201d and two years later \u201cannounced that all military roles, units and schools would officially be open to women with \u2018no exceptions\u2019.\u201d", "Now that women fly fighter jets and serve as army rangers, the reasoning goes, there is no justification for giving them a pass on registering for the Selective Service. So held Gray Miller, a district-court judge in Texas, in 2019. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals shared that sentiment but reversed Judge Miller\u2019s ruling. Rostker is still binding law, the court noted, and new circumstances do not give a lower court \u201clicence to disregard or overrule\u201d a Supreme Court precedent.", "Will the justices agree to reconsider their 40-year-old ruling\u2014released days before Sandra Day O\u2019Connor would be nominated as the first woman to join their ranks\u2014that \u201cmen and women are simply not similarly situated\u201d in the military context? The plaintiffs cite a 1973 case argued by a young Ruth Bader Ginsburg (two decades before she became a Supreme Court justice) as encouragement: \u201cAlthough purportedly protective of women\u201d, stereotypes of women as belonging at home put them \u201cnot on a pedestal, but in a cage\u201d.", "The American Civil Liberties Union is bringing the case on behalf of a men\u2019s-rights group and two male plaintiffs. They enjoy support from the National Organisation for Women and a group of former generals. However, an amicus brief from a coalition including the Eagle Forum, a conservative organisation founded by Phyllis Schlafly, an anti-feminism activist who died in 2016, defends the status quo.", "It is an \u201cunassailable biological fact\u201d, the brief argues, that men are generally bigger, stronger and faster than women.
