But as the leaders feasted, suffering Iranians stewed. Just over a year later, in 1979, Pahlavi was ousted and mullahs led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power. It turned out Iran was not that stable. It has been causing trouble in the region ever since.", "Few, least of all America\u2019s spooks, saw the revolution coming in 1979. Nor, just a few years ago, did many imagine that America and Iran would come to the brink of war in 2019. But in June President Donald Trump nearly bombed Iran, which had attacked commercial shipping and shot down an American drone. There was more talk of war in September, after Iran or its proxy attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. The risk of an all-out conflict will cast a shadow over 2020.", "The backdrop to this bleak picture is Mr Trump\u2019s decision in 2018 to ditch a deal, negotiated under Barack Obama, that curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in return for economic relief. The president says he wants a new agreement that also limits Iran\u2019s missile programme and its meddling in the region. His administration has pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d, heaping sanctions on Iran in the hope of pushing it back to the negotiating table\u2014or spurring another revolution. So far, though, it has merely strengthened Iran\u2019s hardliners and re\u00adinforced their distrust of America.", "American officials are betting that Iran will reach a breaking-point in 2020, or soon thereafter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hell,\u201d says Mr Trump. \u201cThey are broke.\u201d The sanctions have cut Iran off from the global economy; its oil exports are close to zero, as America threatens potential buyers. The hardship has led to protests. But Iran is not broke, say America\u2019s own analysts. They predict that it has enough foreign reserves to last two years. Iran\u2019s \u201cresistance economy\u201d was built to withstand external pressure and evade scrutiny. It has weathered sanctions before.", "The Iranian regime will not collapse in 2020. Rather, it will restart more parts of its nuclear programme that were stopped under the deal. And, like a cornered animal, it will lash out in the region. With its trade dwindling, Iran has little to lose from turning the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply passes, into a gauntlet. The regime\u2019s Revolutionary Guard and its proxies in Yemen and Iraq will launch more attacks on America\u2019s allies in the region. Iran will show America that it can impose pain, too.", "All hope is not lost, however. Iran says Saudi Arabia, its arch-rival, has reached out through intermediaries. The kingdom is growing weary of its involvement in Yemen, where it is battling the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. A deal could be reached which ends that humanitarian disaster. Mr Trump is also eager to talk to Iran\u2019s leaders. So far they have rebuffed him, claiming he only wants a \u201cphoto opportunity\u201d. But Hassan Rouhani, the president, says that if America lifts its sanctions, \u201cthen negotiations with the US are a possibility.\u201d He even concedes that the nuclear deal is imperfect.", "Mr Trump and Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s despot, traded insults and threats before meeting in 2018. Then, says Mr Trump, they \u201cfell in love\u201d (though achieved little). A similar turnaround in America\u2019s relationship with Iran is not out of the question. It would distract from Mr Trump\u2019s domestic problems and boost his ego (and, perhaps, his presidential campaign). He might even settle for a deal that looks a lot like the old one, but has his name on it. The mullahs, under pressure at home, would be foolish not to allow Mr Rouhani to sit down with him.", "So why is a genuine breakthrough unlikely in 2020? Iran\u2019s hardliners largely define themselves by their hostility to America. Mr Trump\u2019s hawkish colleagues in the Republican Party are unlikely to support any deal that Iran would sign. Improved relations, and the comp\u00adromises they would entail, carry risks for both sides. But a photo opportunity would be better than war.", "This article appeared in the Middle East section of the print edition under the headline \u201cThe dreadful relationship\u201d"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["dreadful", "mr", "trump", "americas", "region", "deal", "america", "iran", "president", "irans", "2020", "relationship", "sanctions"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
