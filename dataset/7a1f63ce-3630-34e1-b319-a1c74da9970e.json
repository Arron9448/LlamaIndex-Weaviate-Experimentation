Or, perhaps more accurately, there are multiple ways, and they each tell a different story. Unique visitors\u2014the sheer number of people who have landed on a story\u2014is the bluntest of metrics. For publications sustained by advertising revenue, this number is key, because each visit, no matter how brief, generates some incremental amount of revenue. But the number fails to capture whether these readers stick around and form any kind of loyalty to a publication. Engaged minutes, the term for the total amount of time that readers spend on a piece, is more helpful. But even this metric, however gratifying, doesn\u2019t fully capture The New Yorker\u2019s ambition to be a valued daily destination for news and cultural coverage, ideas and arguments, fiction and poetry, and humor. As a result, I\u2019ve been intrigued by a new measurement tool, developed by Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s data-science team, that tracks all of the pieces someone reads on the way to subscribing to the magazine. This \u201csubscription contribution,\u201d as we call it, is a useful way of understanding what our audience values most about The New Yorker\u2014not just what readers are willing to pay for but what sparks a lasting relationship with them. That seems like as good a definition for \u201cfavorite\u201d as any.", "What\u2019s on this year\u2019s top-stories list, based on their subscription-contribution scores? A diverse collection of twenty-five pieces that includes ambitious investigative reporting, personal histories, cultural criticism, commentary, interviews, and essays. I particularly love the fact that the list collectively embodies what The New Yorker is today. It\u2019s nearly evenly split between pieces that were published in the weekly magazine and online only. There are triumphs of investigative reporting, by the likes of Jane Mayer, Ronan Farrow, and Connie Bruck, and also a glorious riff on Keanu Reeves, by Naomi Fry, and a personal essay by Emilia Clarke, the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star, who, in the run-up to the show\u2019s final season, wrote about surviving two brain aneurysms. There\u2019s an interview, by Michael Schulman, with Linda Ronstadt, and a profile, by Nathan Heller, of Elizabeth Anderson, a philosopher whose work focusses on equality as the basis for a free society.", "Coverage of politics is well represented, including David Remnick\u2019s interview with Nancy Pelosi shortly after she launched the House impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Masha Gessen\u2019s reflection on the term \u201cconcentration camp,\u201d and Adam Entous\u2019s deeply reported piece on how the troubled past of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter might affect the former Vice-President\u2019s bid for the White House. But, in terms of the stories that drove the most New Yorker subscriptions, the subject matter was refreshingly varied. \u201cThe Day the Dinosaurs Died,\u201d Douglas Preston\u2019s remarkable story on a young paleontologist\u2019s stunning discovery in North Dakota, is No. 3. Ian Parker\u2019s meticulous unravelling of the many real-life deceptions of the mystery novelist Dan Mallory is No. 8. Richard Brody\u2019s withering review of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood\u201d makes the Top Twenty.", "There\u2019s a classic example of narrative magazine writing in Rachel Aviv\u2019s harrowing piece on a woman\u2019s struggle to stop taking prescription psychiatric drugs. Jonathan Franzen\u2019s pessimistic essay on climate change polarized Twitter, but few other pieces drove more new subscriptions. Joshua Rothman\u2019s fascinating exploration of the art of decision-making\u2014part memoir about becoming a father and part idea-driven books essay\u2014which rounded out the top ten, is hard for me even to characterize, except that it felt thoroughly of The New Yorker.", "The most surprising piece on the list, other than Franzen\u2019s? I\u2019d highlight two: an essay by Chris Wiley about the photographer Lee Friedlander\u2019s sixty years of documenting his marriage with his wife, Maria; and Isaac Chotiner\u2019s interview with a Harvard astronomer about a mysterious object travelling through our solar system.", "Enjoy them all.
