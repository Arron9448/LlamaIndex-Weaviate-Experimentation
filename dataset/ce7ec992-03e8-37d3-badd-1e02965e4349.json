His proposed gun-control measures are far more modest. But the Virginians who gathered this month at a meeting of the board of supervisors of Augusta County, in the state\u2019s rural west, were not buying that. The meeting included a vote on whether the county should declare itself a \u201cSecond Amendment sanctuary\u201d. It was held at a high school to accommodate the crowd that was expected to show up. In the end, so many people came to protest against supposed Democratic plans to disarm them that they could not all fit in, and loudspeakers had to be set up outside for the latecomers.", "At least 60 of Virginia\u2019s 95 counties have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries in recent weeks. They follow counties in states such as Colorado and New Mexico. They have borrowed from the left the rhetoric of the \u201csanctuary cities\u201d movement, where local governments limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities in an attempt to protect illegal immigrants from deportation. But, in practice, for a county to declare itself a Second Amendment sanctuary is little more than a howl of rage from rural gun owners.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "In Virginia the movement began in November, when Democrats took control of both houses of the state\u2019s legislature for the first time in over two decades. Gun control was a big issue in that election. After a gunman killed 12 people in Virginia Beach in May, Mr Northam called a special legislative meeting on gun control. The Republicans, who at the time had a majority in both chambers, put a quick end to it. Gun-control groups responded by pumping money into the election. When they take office in January, the Democrats plan to introduce tighter background checks and a ban on the purchase of some types of guns.", "Yet what is popular in Virginia\u2019s fast-growing cities and suburbs, where well-educated and immigrant newcomers have settled, is anathema in rural areas like Augusta County. According to Terry King, a 66-year-old retired welder, the Democrats\u2019 measures were \u201copening a door you can\u2019t close\u201d. What started with background checks would surely end with the confiscation of the guns he had been using to hunt deer and rabbits since he was a child. Like others in the predominantly male crowd, he wore an orange \u201cGuns save lives\u201d sticker on his plaid flannel shirt. The stickers had been handed out by the Virginia Citizens Defence League ( VCDL ), a gun-rights outfit which helped draft the county\u2019s resolution.", "\u201cThe problem is the people who have moved into the cities,\u201d said Gary Colvan, a 60-year-old former carpenter on disability benefits who stood in the cold for two hours to show his support. City dwellers did not understand, he went on, that it was not just a question of culture: rural Virginians needed guns to defend their families. \u201cOut here a police officer can be half an hour away,\u201d he said. Mass shootings pained him, of course, but armed citizens made America safer, not more dangerous."], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["guns", "meeting", "rural", "virginia", "county", "sanctuary", "second", "controls", "states", "gun", "end", "virginians", "rail"], "id": "ce7ec992-03e8-37d3-badd-1e02965e4349", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/12/21/rural-virginians-rail-against-gun-controls"}
