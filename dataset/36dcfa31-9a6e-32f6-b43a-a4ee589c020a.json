She didn\u2019t want to leave me with a babysitter,\u201d she says. While she disliked going to sales with her mother at first, Haroutounian slowly became interested in clothing. Her mother had an affinity for American designers of the \u201970s, such as Stephen Burrows, Geoffrey Beene, and Norma Kamali, which sparked Haroutounian\u2019s obsession with clothes. \u201cI kind of fell in love with clothes there,\u201d she says. Her first purchase was at 10 years old when she went to a yard sale of a former rock band manager. \u201cThere were \u201970s clothes, like platforms and all of these really rare T-shirts,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything was a quarter. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been super into collecting.\u201d From that sale, Haroutounian has kept a Hole T-shirt, as well as an authentic John Lennon and Yoko Ono \u201cBed-Ins for Peace\u201d T-shirt that she estimates is worth about $1,000.", "At 13, Haroutounian started to make a profit. Her first sale was a \u201960s Swiss-made record player that she bought for $50 and resold for $1,200. Later at 16, she purchased a \u201990s Betsey Johnson bondage skirt from a thrift store for $1 and sold it to one of her mother\u2019s customers for $60. She didn\u2019t launch her website until 2017, when she was in high school and cleaning out her closet with a friend who recommended she start selling on Depop. \u201cI was hesitant, but when I started, everything sold pretty quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just kind of went from there.\u201d During her time selling, Haroutounian has found some stellar gems, including a Jean Paul Gaultier tattoo dress and matching bolero from spring 1994, a pair of Versace boots from the fall 1992 S&M collection, and a Prada suit from spring 1996, which she describes as \u201cavocado green with a Bakelite buckle.\u201d It\u2019s not the only celebrity-favorite piece in her collection. One of the most standout items is a red leather Chanel jacket from fall 1992, the same style that Claudia Schiffer wore on the runway."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["paying", "selling", "clothes", "mother", "vintage", "tshirt", "haroutounian", "spring", "college", "yard", "22yearold", "started", "sale", "went", "rare", "depop", "sales"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
