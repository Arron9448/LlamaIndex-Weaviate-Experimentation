Jularbo, a mother of four, projects the mixture of sternness and warmth that one expects from a nurse. In the previous month, COVID-19 had begun sweeping across Europe, but Swedish schools remained open. As Jularbo bent to take the student\u2019s temperature, the student coughed and then said, \u201cOh, maybe I should tell you, my partner has been diagnosed with corona.\u201d Jularbo ordered the student to go home immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t go back to class to get your bag,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have someone bring it to you.\u201d", "Four days later, Jularbo woke with a fever and a splitting headache. \u201cI understand why people who are really sick, or people who are in excruciating pain, say, \u2018I just want to die,\u2019 \u201d she told me. She was so tired that she couldn\u2019t leave her room for several days. One morning, she made tea and sat on the couch, determined to see her children off to school; she woke up to the sounds of them coming home, tea cool on the table. After nine days, the last two symptom-free, she went back to work. But a week later the headache and fever returned. She locked herself in her office to avoid exposing anyone. \u201cI was so, so scared that I had made someone else in the office sick,\u201d she told me.", "Jularbo\u2019s illness came at a pivotal time for Sweden. While lockdowns, curfews, and travel bans were being rolled out across the rest of the world, Swedish restaurants, stores, bars, museums, day cares, and elementary schools all remained open. People were encouraged to work from home and to reduce travel, but both were optional. Masks were not recommended and remained rare. Households could mix; until the end of March, even parties of up to five hundred people were allowed. The man behind Sweden\u2019s coronavirus response is Anders Tegnell, the country\u2019s head epidemiologist. Tegnell worked in Zaire during the 1995 Ebola epidemic, and then served as an expert on infectious diseases for the European Union before being hired by the Swedish public-health agency, in 2013.", "The Swedish constitution gives government agencies extraordinary independence, so Tegnell and the public-health agency have led much of the coronavirus response, and, constitutionally, the government has little power to impose restrictions. Tegnell, who is sixty-four and tall, with round glasses, has often said that lockdowns are not supported by science and that the evidence for mask-wearing is \u201cweak.\u201d His stance is a startling departure from the scientific consensus, but he maintains that if other countries were led by experts rather than politicians, more nations would have policies like Sweden\u2019s. The world has been left gawking. American liberals were shocked that the country of Greta Thunberg could seem so scientifically backward. Right-wing activists in Minnesota held up signs during anti-lockdown protests reading \u201cBe Like Sweden.\u201d Within the country, Tegnell has become an icon of Swedish exceptionalism, believed to be excessively reasonable, levelheaded, and rational. Supporters praised him for not giving in to political panic. Wearing a mask in Sweden was sometimes seen as a signifier of being anti-science.", "Jularbo has many friends and colleagues who contracted COVID-19, and her case was severe. But I met her in the \u201cAnders Tegnell Fan Club\u201d on Facebook, which contains a smorgasbord of multimedia tributes: T-shirts bearing his face, a chocolate figurine in his image, a poster with his face glowering above the words \u201cWash your hands.\u201d \u201cI prefer to have medical experts making the decisions instead of maybe a prime minister who knows, excuse me, shit, about health and medical issues,\u201d Jularbo told me. She\u2019s not the only person in the group who has caught the coronavirus. Staffan Hugemark, a fifty-three-year-old who works at a software company, got sick along with his family after returning from a ski trip in northern Italy. Still, he recently had a falling out with an old friend who disagreed with Sweden\u2019s policies. \u201cPeople look at Sweden and think that it\u2019s a disaster here, and it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. Viktoria Ell\u00e9nius, a forty-seven-year-old former aesthetician, got sick early in the pandemic and couldn\u2019t work for weeks, which caused her to lose her skin-care business; she couldn\u2019t get a test, but she thinks she had COVID-19. Nevertheless, she believes that Tegnell\u2019s policies saved the country from the costs of a lockdown, including economic damage and widespread depression. \u201cAt the beginning, I didn\u2019t like Anders Tegnell,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the more I have heard about him, the more time has gone by, the more I love him.\u201d", "Jularbo is now working with long-haul COVID-19 patients in the rehabilitation unit of a hospital in Eskilstuna, seventy miles west of Stockholm. She suffers from long-term symptoms herself, including lingering fatigue. \u201cI\u2019ve never been tired like this,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy alarm goes off, and it\u2019s like, shoot me. I don\u2019t care if my kids get to school on time. I don\u2019t care about anything.\u201d Still, she\u2019s proud of how Sweden\u2019s public-health agency has handled the pandemic. \u201cThey\u2019ve been good. They haven\u2019t been running around listening to what everybody else does,\u201d she said. This winter, she messaged me, \u201cI\u2019m more worried about you living in the states. The pandemic is hitting hard.\u201d", "Most mornings, my husband, who is Swedish, FaceTimes with his friends or family in Sweden. Early in the pandemic, the calls seemed like windows into ordinary lives, largely uninterrupted. Children had birthday parties and sleepovers. Adults met in restaurants and bars. A friend sent a video of a gym class in Stockholm\u2014twenty people breathing heavily in a windowless room. My father-in-law is in his seventies and has a severe lung condition, which means that if he\u2019s infected with COVID-19, it\u2019s more likely to be fatal. But while my husband and I, in California, stayed home, he and my mother-in-law were still going out shopping and seeing friends without wearing masks. They\u2019re not reckless or uninformed people. My father-in-law is a retired engineer who reads the paper every morning, and we almost always agree about politics. Yet every time we suggested that perhaps they should be wearing masks when they went to, say, a bar, we were met with polite skepticism. My father-in-law recently discussed masks with his lung doctor, a senior physician at one of the country\u2019s top hospitals, whose advice was that the only reason one might consider wearing one was because other people would think you were sick and give you more space. This was the philosophy my in-laws adopted. A healthy person \u201ccan\u2019t wear a mask in Sweden,\u201d my mother-in-law told me, in October. \u201cPeople will look at you like you are a very strange person.\u201d The Swedish health agency communicated to the public that there was insufficient evidence that masks prevent transmissions, that they are often used incorrectly, and that they could be used as an excuse not to distance properly, which would be harmful.", "Tegnell introduced the country\u2019s light-touch approach to the pandemic in March, as cases were mounting. Internal e-mails obtained by the freelance journalist Emanuel Karlsten show that the government at least considered whether the strategy might lead to more widespread immunity. In an e-mail exchange between Tegnell and the head of the Finnish public-health agency, on March 14th and 15th, Tegnell suggested that keeping the schools open could help the young and healthy develop immunity sooner. His Finnish colleagues noted that their models found that closing schools would decrease the infection rate among the elderly by ten per cent. Tegnell responded, \u201cTen percent might be worth it?\u201d", "However, Sweden seems to have settled on its final strategy primarily through a mix of unorthodox scientific conclusions, pragmatism, and folkvett, a particularly Swedish notion of common sense. No epidemiologists thought that self-isolation should be a long-term solution. \u201cLockdown is a temporary measure that you do to buy you time,\u201d David Nabarro, a long-time United Nations adviser and one of the World Health Organization\u2019s special envoys on COVID-19, told me. But most countries were unable to get the virus under control and decided to leave lockdowns in place until a vaccine became available. This seemed unsustainable to Tegnell. He also shirked masks. A year ago, there were few studies that directly measured the impact of masks on viral-particle emissions and community spread of the virus, and controlled experiments were difficult to conduct, for logistical and ethical reasons. Over the course of the pandemic, evidence supporting masks has piled up. An analysis of mask mandates in German towns found that they may have reduced COVID-19 infections by about forty-five per cent. Another study examined U.S. states with mask mandates, and found that the daily growth of infections was two per cent lower in states where a mask mandate had been in place for a few weeks. By April, 2020, the W.H.O., the Centers for Disease Control, and other groups decided that there was enough evidence, and recommended face coverings. The C.D.C. now firmly concludes that \u201cexperimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Yet Tegnell remained unsatisfied. In April, 2020, he wrote a letter to the European Center for Disease Control urging against a mask recommendation, saying, \u201cThe argument for and evidence for an effect of face covering to limit the spread from asymptomatic persons is not clear. . . . The arguments against are at least as convincing.\u201d", "As the Swedish strategy garnered attention, Johan Giesecke, Sweden\u2019s former head epidemiologist, told UnHerd, a British YouTube channel, that he expected the infection fatality rate to be \u201cmuch, much lower\u201d than was being reported in the media at the time. \u201cI think it will be like a severe influenza rate, on the order of 0.1%.\u201d (A study by the Swedish public health-agency later found that the rate was at least six times higher in Stockholm.) He said that the difference between Sweden and other countries\u2019 policies was that \u201cthe Swedish government decided early, in January, that the measures we should take against the pandemic should be evidence-based. And when you start looking around at the measures that are being taken now by other countries, you find that very few of them have a shred of evidence.\u201d Tegnell said that he had been in close contact with his counterparts in the United Kingdom, who were planning similarly light restrictions. But cases in the U.K. were increasing rapidly. On March 16th, scientists at Imperial College London published a paper, based on an epidemiological model, predicting that, unless some form of lockdown was imposed, more than five hundred thousand Brits would die from preventable COVID-19 infections. A week later, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced that his government would be closing schools, bars, and restaurants, falling in step with the rest of Europe. \u201cIt was slightly frustrating,\u201d Tegnell told me, when I spoke to him, in August. \u201cWe were really hoping we could take us through this crisis together.\u201d", "Sweden is a country of ten million people, about the size of Los Angeles County, and almost twenty per cent of Swedes live in Stockholm, the largest city. In April, 2020, a widely-circulated pre-print version of a paper by researchers at Uppsala University, adapting the Imperial College model, predicted that, under the Swedish strategy, fifty per cent of susceptible Swedes would be infected within thirty days, resulting in over eighty thousand deaths by July. That spring, the virus began spreading unchecked in Sweden. \u201cIt just kept adding up,\u201d Tegnell said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re always kind of hopeful and think that, O.K., this is something that\u2019s going to pass over.\u201d Soon, the per-capita death toll was among the highest in Europe. Slight modifications were made to the Swedish advice: visitors to nursing homes were banned on March 30th; people were not allowed to gather in groups larger than fifty. Tegnell told me that the death toll weighed on him. \u201cI think this was a big frustration and feeling of failure for us,\u201d he said. But he remained steadfast, often saying, in interviews, \u201cJudge me in a year.\u201d", "Tara Twana, a member of the Stockholm County Council, heard about the mounting infections in nursing homes at the beginning of the pandemic and felt grateful that her elderly parents still lived at home. Twana is forty-nine, with long hair that she wears in a blowout. She and her family are Iraqi Kurdish, and her father was one of the leaders in the peshmerga movement for Kurdish independence. The family fled Iraq in 1988 and sought asylum in Sala, Sweden. \u201cThe people in Sala were very very kind,\u201d Twana told me. As a child, Twana resented her parents\u2019 activism, which often required that they travel away from home, but, in college, she joined a left-wing political party and began to get involved in local politics. Since joining the county council, she has focussed her efforts on public health and women\u2019s issues.", "In the beginning of the pandemic, Twana was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Tegnell\u2019s response. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the Swedish government,\u201d Twana said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m assimilated a lot in the Swedish society.\u201d At the government\u2019s advice, she and her family limited their movement somewhat but never wore masks. Then, at the end of March, Twana\u2019s sixty-seven-year-old mother, Pari, came down with a headache and fever. Twana tried to check her into a hospital to keep her away from her father, Abdulla, who was eighty-three, but doctors told them to stay home. They said that there was no need to wear masks but that they should try to stay apart in the house. They spoke to one another on the telephone from different rooms.", "A week later, Abdulla wandered into his bedroom, looking confused, and asked Pari where he was and whether there was a toilet in the house. She called an ambulance, which took him to the hospital, where he tested positive for the coronavirus, with a hundred-and-five-degree fever. Twana\u2019s mother was soon admitted, too, as her symptoms worsened, and husband and wife shared a room. Two days later, Twana\u2019s father\u2019s oxygen levels began dropping. Twana called him on FaceTime to say goodbye. At Christmas, he\u2019d given her a book that he had written, entirely by hand, on Kurdish history in Mesopotamia, and had asked for her feedback. She hadn\u2019t had time to read it, but she lied, telling him that she had liked it. She told me, \u201cHe was so happy. I promised I would publish his book.\u201d He died sixteen hours later.", "Twana, and some others in Sweden, feel let down by how their government has managed the pandemic. Alexandra R\u00f6nnholm, a fifty-four-year-old government employee, lost her husband in January. She wrote to me to say that Tegnell and his colleagues \u201chave acted too late and too little which has led to over 12000 people premature death including my husband. He would have lived without Corona!\u201d Nanaz Fassih, a fifty-two-year-old pediatric nurse, was skeptical of the Swedish response from the beginning; she tried to wear a mask to work in hospitals and clinics, but was told that this was not allowed. (Today, masks are more commonly used in Swedish hospitals.) On December 25th, she lost her eighty-three-year-old father to COVID-19. She had often heard the Prime Minister speaking in support of the health ministry\u2019s policies. \u201cHe said the strategy is going well,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow can he say it is good?\u201d Twana wishes that the government had instituted stricter protections. \u201cThat\u2019s a politician\u2019s work, to take information and protect the people in society,\u201d she said. Instead, she said, \u201cAnders Tegnell, he was Prime Minister.\u201d She added, \u201cI still believe in the government. I do. But I\u2019m very, very sad about how they dealt with the issues with the pandemic.\u201d", "This summer, case counts began to drop in Sweden. When I spoke to Tegnell at the end of August, he felt that the worst was behind him. Just a few weeks later, he and other international experts had a special audience with Boris Johnson, to give advice on how Sweden had brought numbers down with their light-touch approach. \u201cI think we are reasonably optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cOur prognosis is, No, we don\u2019t really see a huge second wave coming on.\u201d This did not last. By December, cases and hospitalizations were higher than they\u2019d been since the earliest days of the pandemic. Intensive-care units in Stockholm and Malm\u00f6, the country\u2019s third biggest city, were full. \u201cIt was just this development we did not want to see,\u201d Bj\u00f6rn Eriksson, Stockholm\u2019s director of health and medical care, said during a press conference. Confidence in the public-health agency had fallen from sixty-eight per cent in October, to fifty-two per cent in December. The government appointed an independent commission to investigate the Swedish response to the pandemic, and passed a new law temporarily allowing the state to close businesses as needed.", "Tegnell\u2019s prediction of a tapering epidemic curve and quickly-attained immunity never came to pass. Sweden\u2019s per-capita case counts and death rates have been many times higher than any of its Nordic neighbors, all of which imposed lockdowns, travel bans, and limited gatherings early on. Over all in Sweden, thirteen thousand people have died from COVID-19. In Norway, which has a population that is half the size of Sweden\u2019s, and where stricter lockdowns were enforced, about seven hundred people have died. It\u2019s likely that some simple policy changes\u2014especially shutting down visitations to nursing homes sooner, and providing more P.P.E. and testing to nursing-home staff\u2014would have saved lives. And the strategy doesn\u2019t seem to have helped the economy much: the Swedish G.D.P. fell by around three per cent, better than the European average, but similar to the drop in other Nordic countries.", "Fredrik Elgh, a virologist at Ume\u00e5 University and one of Tegnell\u2019s former bosses, wishes that Sweden had implemented restrictions like those used by other countries in the region. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go the same route as our neighbors that have been so successful?\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have done that, too, if we had followed their path.\u201d The fatalities in the elder homes, which account for about fifty per cent of the COVID-19 deaths in Sweden, seem especially needless; if visits to these facilities had been banned sooner, if their workers had been advised to wear masks and get tested frequently, it\u2019s possible that thousands of lives could have been saved. People from both pro- and anti-Tegnell camps believe that this was an unnecessary tragedy. (Tegnell agrees, although he does not think that the responsibility lies solely with the health agency.) \u201cThe Swedish strategy aimed at protecting the elderly has failed,\u201d Mats Melin, the country\u2019s former chief justice and the current head of the government-appointed Corona Commission, told me. In December, Sweden\u2019s King, Carl XVI Gustaf, criticized the country\u2019s policies, telling the state broadcaster, \u201cThe Swedish people have suffered enormously in difficult conditions,\u201d and adding that, when it came to the strategy that the country employed, \u201cI think we have failed.\u201d Stefan Lofven, the country's Prime Minister, told reporters, \u201cThe fact that so many people have died cannot be seen as anything else than a failure.\u201d", "But, although the outcome in Sweden was a black spot in Scandinavia, \u201ccompared to other countries in Europe, it\u2019s not the worst off,\u201d Patrick Heuveline, a professor of sociology at U.C.L.A. who studies pandemic mortality rates, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as Italy, Spain, the U.K., and Belgium for example.\u201d Tegnell holds up this statistic when defending his strategy, claiming that sparsely-populated Norway and Finland are the outliers, and that Sweden should be compared to the rest of Europe. Sweden has a larger foreign-born population than other Nordic countries, and its population is more concentrated in urban areas, Tegnell claims. Other experts are skeptical of this argument. \u201cI find no correlation between proportion of foreign-born and Covid death rate,\u201d Heuveline wrote, in an e-mail. \u201cNorway has a higher proportion of foreign-born than Denmark, which has about the same proportion as Italy (about 10%), but Covid-19 mortality is much higher in Italy than in Denmark, and higher in Denmark than in Norway.\u201d Over all, Elgh, Heuveline and other experts argue, Sweden\u2019s population is more similar to the other Nordic countries. Its first infections also came later than in other parts of Europe, giving its government more time to warn its citizens of the virus\u2019 severity. For these reasons, comparisons to the rest of Scandinavia, which are less favorable to Sweden, may be more apt."], "authors": ["Mallory Pickett", "Mallory Picket", "Jerome Groopma", "Isaac Chotine"], "keywords": ["tegnell", "masks", "covid19", "experiment", "swedish", "pandemic", "told", "swedens", "sweden", "twana", "strategy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
