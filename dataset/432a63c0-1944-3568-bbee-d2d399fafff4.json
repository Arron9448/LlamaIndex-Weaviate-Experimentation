Today\u2019s launch of her latest project, a collaboration with the iconic Champagne brand, Dom P\u00e9rignon is proof of that fact. The Nick Knight\u2013directed clip revealed the partnership and a peek at the bottle of ros\u00e9 and sculpture Gaga designed especially for Dom P\u00e9rignon. Its trippy visuals of crystal castles which morph into catwalks and an endless party where Gaga and her pastel-clad entourage dance to the sound of her Chromatica hit, \u201cFree Woman\u201d before the singer is transformed into one of Knight\u2019s silhouette portraits are an appropriately surreal introduction to an unexpected team up.", "A host of Haus of Gaga mainstays teamed up on the project, including Knight, long-term collaborator and creative director Nicola Formichetti and Haus of Gaga makeup artist Sarah Tanno, and hair stylist Frederic Aspiras. You have them to thank for all that eerie Born this Way album art, but this go-round, they went in a completely different direction. Envisioning a celebratory atmosphere with the effervescence of a sip of ros\u00e9, they created a \u201cQueendom\u201d ruled by Gaga and her fans. \u201cWe wanted to express the power of creative freedom and inhabit a world where this is possible,\u201d shared Gaga from Rome, where she is filming Ridley Scott\u2019s House of Gucci.", "Seeking visuals that felt \u201cinspiring, collaborative, and free,\u201d Gaga and the entire Haus of Gaga team prioritized innovation. Knight\u2019s surrealist style and wealth of fresh ideas made him the ideal choice for the project. \u201cEvery time we work together, we find a way to do something we\u2019ve never done before, and this collaboration is no exception,\u201d Gaga says. \u201cAnd of course, there are my creative collaborators from the Haus of Gaga, including Nicola, [choreographer] Richy Jackson, Freddie, and Sarah. There\u2019s a certain alchemy that happens when we create together.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["creativity", "visuals", "collaboration", "project", "team", "sarah", "mission", "ros\u00e9", "way", "lady", "unexpected", "haus", "creative", "gaga"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
