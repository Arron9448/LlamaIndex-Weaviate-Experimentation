Most Republicans remain fiercely loyal to the former president, but others are seeking a new direction for the party.", "The House of Representatives impeached Trump on 13 January on a charge of inciting an insurrection by exhorting thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Congress was gathered to certify Joe Biden\u2019s election victory.", "Call participants said they were particularly dismayed by the fact that more than half of the Republicans in Congress \u2013 eight senators and 139 House representatives \u2013 voted to block certification of Biden\u2019s election victory just hours after the Capitol siege. Most Republican senators have also indicated they will not support the conviction of Trump in this week\u2019s Senate impeachment trial.", "\u201cLarge portions of the Republican party are radicalising and threatening American democracy,\u201d McMullin told Reuters. \u201cThe party needs to recommit to truth, reason and founding ideals or there clearly needs to be something new.\u201d", "Asked about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: \u201cThese losers left the Republican party when they voted for Joe Biden.\u201d", "A representative for the Republican National Committee referred to a recent statement from its chair, Ronna McDaniel. \u201cIf we continue to attack each other and focus on attacking on fellow Republicans, if we have disagreements within our party, then we are losing sight of 2022 [elections],\u201d McDaniel said on Fox News last month. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to win is if we come together.\u201d", "The Biden White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "McMullin said just over 40% of those on the Zoom call backed the idea for a third national party. Another option under discussion is to form a \u201cfaction\u201d that would operate either inside the Republican party or outside it.", "Names under consideration for a new party include the Integrity party and the Center Right party. If it is decided instead to form a faction, one name under discussion is the Center Right Republicans.", "Potential members are aware that the US political landscape is littered with the remains of previous failed attempts at establishing a third party.", "\u201cBut there is a far greater hunger for a new political party out there than I have ever experienced in my lifetime,\u201d one participant said."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["form", "security", "officials", "talks", "trump", "told", "antitrump", "discussions", "zoom", "republican", "house", "party", "election", "dozens", "republicans"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
