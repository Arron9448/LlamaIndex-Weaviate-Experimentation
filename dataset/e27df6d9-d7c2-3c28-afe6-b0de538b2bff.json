You can still see that fierce girl in the woman Lee has become: A trailblazing curve model, she remains a serious fighter for racial equity and justice even as she flaunts a personal style she describes as eclectic and eccentric: \u201cgrunge one day, heels the next.\u201d", "Prada coat, bag, and shoes; prada,com.

As a teenager in an Atlanta school, she recalls, \u201cI was the chunky cheerleader. They said, \u2018You\u2019re the base.\u2019 I said, \u2018Nooo!

You couldn\u2019t contain my energy.\u201d When she began modeling at the age of 18, she was propelled by the same spirit. \u201cThere was hardly anyone who looked like me doing the kinds of jobs I wanted to do. It was always: If you\u2019re big and Black, you could be the lingerie girl, the swim girl.\u201d But Lee wanted to be the high-fashion girl, the girl who got the serious campaigns, the girl who deserved every accolade that thinner, whiter models received. Early on, she took courage from the curve model Crystal Renn: \u201cI saw her doing Dolce & Gabbana and Jean Paul Gaultier, and I was like, You know what? I\u2019m going to do that too.\u201d"], "authors": ["Lynn Yaeger", "Lynn Yaege", "Luis Alberto Rodrigue", "Carlos Nazari"], "keywords": ["lee", "precious", "youre", "zoom", "wanted", "model", "girl", "took", "having", "going", "serious", "moment", "finally", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
