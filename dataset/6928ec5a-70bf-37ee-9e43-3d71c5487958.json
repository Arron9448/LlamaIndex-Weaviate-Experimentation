Before February 2012, she was content to be an anonymous Floridian, working for the Miami housing department and raising her two sons with her ex-husband, Tracy Martin. Then one of her sons, 17-year-old Trayvon, was shot and killed.", "Trayvon had been walking to his father\u2019s fiancee\u2019s house one evening, unarmed, minding his own business; an armed neighbourhood watch coordinator named George Zimmerman decided the teenager was acting suspiciously. Zimmerman called the police, and, against their advice, decided to follow Trayvon. Moments later, after a violent encounter, Trayvon was shot dead. Zimmerman claimed he had acted in self-defence. At the trial, five months later, he was found not guilty of second-degree murder.", "The incident attracted global news attention, sparked mass street protests and launched the Black Lives Matter movement. And Fulton was suddenly its figurehead, leading marches and making direct and powerful speeches, often with tears in her eyes, her fresh grief close to the surface. \u201cThis is not about a black and white thing,\u201d she said at one march. \u201cThis is about a right and wrong thing.\u201d", "Eight years on, Fulton, 54, has influence on a national level as a campaigner, activist, author, public speaker and media commentator. Her work has brought her into contact with powerful people, from the Obamas, who invited her to the White House (Barack Obama said Trayvon could have been him, 35 years previously) and Hillary Clinton to Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 (the latter of whom included Fulton in her Lemonade visual album). Last year, Fulton made her first foray into politics. As she once put it: \u201cIt took my son being shot down to make me stand up.\u201d", "Trayvon Martin in 2012. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock", "Fulton was thrust into the spotlight, but she made the decision to hold it. Speaking on Zoom from her Florida home, she explains that, after Trayvon\u2019s death, she knew her life and her privacy would never be the same. \u201cI just refused to be quiet. My son had no voice and I refused to just let him be just somebody that was shot and killed and the person not go to jail. Initially my focus was Trayvon, and that\u2019s how I started getting involved in activism. I\u2019ve learned since that time that it is so much bigger than Trayvon.\u201d", "The transformation was by no means straightforward. \u201cFor the majority of my life, 95%, I had a happy life. I had a joyful life. And when this tragedy happened, I found myself in a dark, dark space that I wasn\u2019t familiar with, and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. And I listened to people tell me how strong I was, but I didn\u2019t feel strong at all. I felt weak. I felt hopeless. I felt helpless.\u201d She dabs tears from her eyes with a tissue. Behind her on the bookshelves are several framed photographs of Trayvon. \u201cEvery day I would say to myself I was strong, I was strong, but I did not feel that way. I needed my inside to match up with my outside. And then I started to believe in myself. I started to trust in God and I was praying and I was meditating, and I looked in the mirror one day and said: \u2018You are strong.\u2019\u201d", "Fulton has been more active than ever since Black Lives Matter (BLM) exploded again last year. The high-profile killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, among others, catalysed what is reckoned to have been the largest protest movement in US history. Up to 25 million Americans are estimated to have participated in BLM protests against racism and police violence last summer. Trayvon\u2019s name and image are still a prominent element of the movement \u2013 referenced in placards and social media, and by prominent sports stars such as the tennis player Naomi Osaka, who wore a face mask emblazoned with his name during her victorious US Open campaign last September.", "Whatever comfort Fulton might take from the honouring of her son\u2019s memory, BLM\u2019s resurgence is really a sign of how little progress has been made since his death. She sees parallels in the case of Arbery in particular. Like Trayvon, he was an unarmed young black man whose only \u201ccrime\u201d was being in an area where some people \u2013 civilians, not police officers \u2013 thought he did not belong. He was jogging through a Georgia neighbourhood when three armed men decided to follow him in their vehicles, leading to a fatal altercation.", "Crucially, however, unlike with Trayvon, Arbery\u2019s and Floyd\u2019s deaths were captured on video. \u201cPeople were forced to see the ugly truth,\u201d Fulton says. \u201cThey were forced to see what African Americans have to deal with on a daily basis. They saw it with their own eyes and they weren\u2019t able to take that back, and that\u2019s why you see so many people that\u2019s on the streets joining forces. You\u2019ve never seen so many people not of colour join with Black Lives Matter.\u201d", "Fulton forced herself to watch the video of Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cI didn\u2019t make any comment for a few days. I couldn\u2019t. It was just \u2026\u201d Her words trail off. She pauses to dab away the tears again. \u201cJust really, really, really a bad situation. I just don\u2019t understand the justice system, police policies and procedures \u2026 if that is what we call \u2018protecting and serving\u2019 \u2026 a person who only needed to be arrested \u2026 how did he end up deceased?\u201d", "She is, at least, heartened by the nationwide discussion and debate about the role of policing that has taken place. And by the change of administration. The Trump administration\u2019s response to last year\u2019s protests was often excessive and violent \u2013 fuelled by the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric. As well as his refusals to publicly condemn white supremacists such as the Proud Boys, Trump described BLM as \u201ca symbol of hate\u201d that is \u201cdestroying many lives\u201d.", "Fulton with a collage of her son Trayvon Martin. Photograph: Amanda Edwards/WireImage", "Joe Biden\u2019s presidency is a welcome and much-needed change, she says. In terms of racial justice in particular, she is optimistic. \u201cHe has admitted that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Recognising the problem is the first step. Many have not acknowledged the fact that there are racial disparities in this country. They refuse to rectify the problems such as police reform, an unfair justice system, housing discrimination and mass incarceration, to name a few.\u201d", "The question now is whether BLM has gone as far as it can go as a protest movement, and how to translate activism into political representation. Many mothers with similar experiences to Fulton\u2019s are already trying to make the transition. Lezley McSpadden \u2013 the mother of Michael Brown, whose killing in 2014 by police in Ferguson, Missouri, fuelled the first wave of BLM protests \u2013 ran for Ferguson city council in 2019. She finished third, but since Brown\u2019s death the council membership has gone from being one-sixth black to half. More successful has been Cori Bush, a former nurse who also entered politics as a result of Brown\u2019s death, and in 2020 was elected as congresswoman for Missouri\u2019s 1st district. Or Lucy McBath, whose 17-year-old son Jordan Davis was also shot and killed in Florida, in November 2012, following an argument over loud music. She is now the Democrat representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th congressional district, having defeated a white, pro-gun Republican in the 2018 midterm elections.", "Last August, Fulton ran for Miami-Dade county commissioner, on a platform of local improvements, gun control and championing ordinary people (she did not call for defunding the police). This is Fulton\u2019s home territory: she has lived her entire life in the area she sought to represent. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Florida Memorial University, a historically black college with strong Christian links, and for more than 25 years she worked for the Miami-Dade County Housing Development Agency.", "Fulton was endorsed by Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, among others, but lost to Oliver Gilbert, a former mayor of Miami Gardens (who is also African American), by just 331 votes. \u201cI never saw myself as a person being involved in politics but I decided to run because there were some things occurring right here in my own community that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with,\u201d she says. Will she consider running again? \u201cWell, a lot of people have been saying: \u2018You have to do this again because it was too close.\u2019 I can\u2019t tell you right now, honestly. That is something I\u2019m exploring, but I definitely will do my research and take a look at it to see if there\u2019s another seat I want to run for in the near future.\u201d", "For the most part, Fulton\u2019s work has been apolitical and grassroots, geared towards healing, community and opportunity. In 2012 she founded the Trayvon Martin Foundation, which she runs along with Trayvon\u2019s father and their other son, Jahvaris Fulton, who is 30. Their work focuses on issues around gun violence, African American youth empowerment and family support. Since 2014, for example, Fulton has hosted an annual Circle of Mothers weekend in Florida, bringing together 100 or so mothers from across the country who have lost children or family members to gun violence. \u201cIt\u2019s about healing your mind, body and soul. We laugh together, we cry together, we hug together. We do all those things that men find strange,\u201d she laughs. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know each other to do that; we have compassion. I\u2019m not saying that guys don\u2019t, but it\u2019s easier for us to heal as a group.\u201d She regrets being unable to hold the event last year, because of Covid-19. \u201cWe had to do a Zoom call, which is not the same as having people around you, and people who are able to hug you.\u201d But the Circle of Mothers is a growing network. Those mothers are going back to their communities and forming their own local circles. \u201cThat\u2019s how you heal this country.\u201d", "(From left) Geneva Reed-Veal (mother of Sandra Bland), Sybrina Fulton, Gwen Carr (mother of Eric Garner) and Valerie Bell (mother of Sean Bell) at the Oxford Union in 2016. Photograph: Tom Pilston", "Fulton comes from a long line of strong women, she says. Born in Miami, she grew up with her great-grandmother, her grandmother and her mother. \u201cNot saying I did not have strong men, but the women in my family were very dominant. They were loving, but at the same time they took care of business. They took care of the kids and they took care of their husbands. They went to work, they kept the house cleaned, they cooked, they saved money and they went on vacation. I just saw them doing everything. So those were my superwomen.\u201d", "After her encouraging first step into politics, Fulton\u2019s life could now be at another crossroads; the same can be said for her country. What would she like to happen now?", "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever going to be an end to Black Lives Matter until black lives are equal,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just not something that is possible right now. We can\u2019t continue with the system we have in place now. It cannot be like feeling we are strangers in our own country. We want to be able to be comfortable in our own homes, be comfortable running down the street, or playing music too loud, or in Sandra Bland\u2019s case, just being pulled over. [Bland was violently arrested for a minor traffic violation in Texas in 2015. Three days later she was found hanged in her prison cell.] We are a nervous wreck when the police pull us over because we never know when we are going to be shot and killed.\u201d Positive change is needed, she says, and even after Trump\u2019s departure, it will not happen overnight. \u201cIt\u2019s not about changing laws; a law is fairly easy to get changed. It\u2019s about changing mindsets. That\u2019s very hard to do.\u201d", "As for her own future, whether or not she returns to politics, she is likely to remain active and busy. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to fight,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked this life for me. I would not have picked something so severe, but this is the hand I was given. I just have to use what I have, and make sure that I\u2019m using my voice in a positive way.\u201d To that end, she has just finished writing her second book. Her first, Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin, was jointly authored with Tracy Martin and published in 2017. The next one, sole-authored, is more in a self-help, life-counselling vein. \u201cI\u2019m talking about how do you deal with coming back from the dark, dark places that I\u2019ve been through. How do you come back from losing a child, losing a house, losing a job, losing a parent? It\u2019s by no means instructions but it\u2019s a play-by-play of what I did, and what I went through to come back from that dark place.\u201d", "Despite her evident strength and resilience, nobody who has lost a child ever really gets over it, she says. \u201cMost of my days are good, but I still have my bad days. I will carry a hole in my heart for the rest of my life.\u201d"], "authors": ["Steve Rose"], "keywords": ["life", "bigger", "trayvon", "thats", "fulton", "bereaved", "strong", "son", "mother", "fought", "sybrina", "martin", "shot", "really", "black"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
