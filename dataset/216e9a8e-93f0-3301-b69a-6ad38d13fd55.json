There\u2019s been the personnel changes (original director Colin Trevorrow left after \u201ccreative differences\u201d, prompting the return of JJ Abrams). Then there was the fact that this instalment\u2019s predecessor, Rian Johnson\u2019s The Last Jedi, took the story to surprising new places and left a lot of questions unanswered.", "Some fans were left confused; a nastier contingent railed against its so-called \u201cidentity politics\u201d. Even some of the actors have admitted their doubts about The Last Jedi \u2013 John Boyega recently described it as \u201cfeeling a bit iffy\u201d. Add in the fact that this instalment has to cap off a 42-year trilogy of trilogies, and that Baby Yoda from spin-off series The Mandalorian has outshone any character in the movies in terms of public affection, and this has more work to do than it ought to.", "Play Video 2:23 Star Wars 9: The Rise of Skywalker final trailer \u2013 video", "Given that there is no possible way of pleasing all the people even half the time when it comes to Star Wars, the good news is, The Rise of Skywalker is the send-off the saga deserves. The bad news is, it is largely the send-off we expected. Of course there is epic action to savour and surprises and spoilers to spill, but given the long, long build-up, some of the saga\u2019s big revelations and developments might be a little unsatisfying on reflection.", "We\u2019re given little time to think about that though: the story gets moving quickly and barely pauses for breath. The Resistance gang is all brought together swiftly, including a cut-and-pasted Carrie Fisher, and in short measure they\u2019re off in the Millennium Falcon on a kind of galaxy-trotting treasure-hunt, told in quick, efficient strokes. The central characters \u2013 Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe, John Boyega\u2019s Finn, and good old Chewbacca (who gets a bit more to do this time), establish an easy, seriocomic camaraderie that makes you wish they\u2019d spent more time together on screen.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ridley and Carrie Fisher. Photograph: Lucasfilm Ltd./Allstar", "Their whistle-stop tour is fleshed out with action set-pieces, new characters and locations, and plenty of attractive visual detail in the margins. There\u2019s so much plotting and exposition, it feels like two movies condensed into one at times, and there is little downtime in which to really get into any character depth but Abrams\u2019 knack for efficient storytelling and the odd visual flourish carries it along, at least to the half-way point.", "As for the Dark Side, it is no secret that Ian McDiarmid\u2019s old-school Sith lord Emperor Palpatine is back in the frame, along with Adam Driver\u2019s conflicted Kylo Ren, whose cracked mask hints all too obviously at his bruised inner turmoil. But then Rey has her issues too. She is kind to abused droids and injured snake monsters, but there are question marks over her morality too, as hinted at at in the trailer\u2019s much-discussed inclusion of a \u201cdark Rey\u201d.", "Ren and Rey\u2019s mysterious connection has been the most intriguing aspect of the new trilogy. Here, it unfolds in a series of teases and false starts that almost border on wearisome, though there are hints of ambiguity and even eroticism to it. Let\u2019s just hope they don\u2019t turn out to be brother and sister this time. As with the original Star Wars trilogy, there is just enough in this dynamic to muddy up the simplistic good-versus-evil themes, although this latest trilogy has been as much about hope versus fear, which is where it could possibly strike a contemporary chord.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Photograph: Allstar", "The big questions get answered, but cannot be discussed further, for the time being. Let\u2019s just say some old Star Wars traditions die hard. As do old Star Wars characters. There are so many returning old faces in this movie, you start to wonder if anyone ever actually dies and stays dead in this far-away galaxy. But if you\u2019re going to do a send-off this huge, there are a lot of goodbyes to say, and a lot of loose ends to tie up. The fact that The Rise of Skywalker manages most of them and within a vaguely coherent story is something of an achievement in itself. This vast, hulking Star Destroyer of a franchise has become too cumbersome to pull off any genuinely nimble manoeuvres, but at the same time, it never falls out of the sky. Partly that\u2019s a simple matter of momentum, but it is also a question of faith. Over its long history, Star Wars has acquired a mythic grandeur few movie franchises can ever hope to match.", "\u2022 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens on 19 December in the UK and 20 December in the US"], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["rise", "long", "laborious", "end", "star", "exit", "review", "sendoff", "death", "lot", "little", "trilogys", "old", "wars", "skywalker", "trilogy"], "id": "216e9a8e-93f0-3301-b69a-6ad38d13fd55", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Steve Rose"], "title": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker review \u2013 death is not the end in new trilogy's laborious exit"}
