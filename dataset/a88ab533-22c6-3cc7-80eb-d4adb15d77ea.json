The Rev. Jeremy Wong and Karen Busch, residents of Santa Clara County who held religious services in their homes, challenged those limits, saying they interfered with their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.", "A federal judge ruled against them, reasoning that the law imposed limits on all private gatherings, defined as \u201csocial situations that bring together people from different households at the same time in a single space or place,\u201d and did not single out religious services.", "A divided three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to block that ruling while an appeal moved forward. It did not matter, the majority reasoned, that some commercial activities were arguably treated more favorably than private gatherings in homes.", "\u201cThe state reasonably concluded that when people gather in social settings, their interactions are likely to be longer than they would be in a commercial setting; that participants in a social gathering are more likely to be involved in prolonged conversations; that private houses are typically smaller and less ventilated than commercial establishments; and that social distancing and mask-wearing are less likely in private settings and enforcement is more difficult,\u201d Judges Milan D. Smith Jr. and Bridget S. Bade wrote, summarizing the trial court\u2019s findings.", "In dissent, Judge Patrick J. Bumatay wrote that the state was not free to impose harsher restrictions on religious study than on \u201cbarbershops, tattoo and nail parlors, and other personal care businesses.\u201d", "\u201cThe one thing California cannot do is privilege tattoo parlors over Bible studies when loosening household limitations,\u201d he wrote.", "\u201cThe Constitution shields churches, synagogues and mosques not because of their magnificent architecture or superlative acoustics, but because they are a sanctuary for religious observers to practice their faith,\u201d Judge Bumatay wrote. \u201cAnd that religious practice is worthy of protection no matter where it happens.\u201d"], "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "keywords": ["likely", "tattoo", "commercial", "wrote", "social", "restrictions", "private", "judge", "meetings", "gatherings", "vote", "supreme", "state", "prayer", "homes", "court", "lifts", "54", "religious"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
