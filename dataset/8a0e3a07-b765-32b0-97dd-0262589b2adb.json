There\u2019s the Green Pass in Israel, which grants Israeli nationals access to spaces like gyms, restaurants, and public pools that were once banned during the pandemic. The European Union, meanwhile, proposed a \u201cDigital Green Certificate\u201d that would allow E.U. citizens to travel throughout the bloc unrestricted. In the United States, New York just rolled out their Excelsior Pass with IBM, and Madison Square Garden has already opted into using the technology.", "But what actually are they, how do they work, and what forms do they take, especially now that the CDC has updated their travel guidelines? (People who have been vaccinated will no longer need to show a negative COVID test or self-quarantine.) Vogue talked to travel experts, government spokespeople, and even the creators of these passes themselves to find out.", "Is there a difference between the terms \u201cvaccine passport\u201d and \u201chealth pass\u201d?", "A \u201cvaccine passport\u201d is a form of identification that can be used internationally, while a \u201chealth pass\u201d is something that likely only works in your own country (or, in here in the U.S., your own state). Think of it this way: A vaccine passport works like your actual passport. A health pass is more akin to your driver\u2019s license. What you should whip out depends on where you are, or where you\u2019re going.", "However, many experts prefer \u201chealth pass\u201d over \u201cvaccine passport\u201d\u2014even when it may have international capabilities. Why? The latter implies you need, well, a vaccine. This is not always true; often times, you can use a recent negative PCR test as proof of good health status.", "Honestly? The terms are often used interchangeably.", "What will they look like?", "It\u2019s still early, but so far, most have been QR codes. You display them via a smartphone app\u2014think of something like a mobile boarding pass\u2014or by going to a website, and then printing them out on a piece of paper. From there, businesses, venues, or border control agents are able to scan them."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["passport", "works", "covidera", "pass", "travel", "future", "need", "test", "passports", "know", "vaccine", "terms", "used", "passes", "health"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
