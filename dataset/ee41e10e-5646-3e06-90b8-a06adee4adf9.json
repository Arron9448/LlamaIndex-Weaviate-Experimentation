So it was a new thing, working from home. But from day one I knew I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Natalia Zurowska, who moved from Poland to France for a better work-life balance Photograph: Kuba Olszak", "At first, Zurowska did her job from different areas of her home to stave off her feelings of malaise. \u201cI did one day at the desk, one day sitting on the couch and one day in the bedroom,\u201d says Zurowska. \u201cBut as lockdown went on \u2013 one week, two weeks, three weeks \u2013 I became constantly connected. During my break, my notifications were always on. When I closed my laptop at the end of the day, I had notifications on my phone. It was disturbing.\u201d", "Zurowska is typical of millions across Europe who were suddenly thrust into remote working when the pandemic hit. EU research shows the numbers who went to full-time WFH mode rocketed from 5% in 2019 to almost 40% last spring. By July, 48% of respondents to a survey conducted by the EU agency Eurofound said they worked wholly or partly from home. In Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Spain, Denmark, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Italy more than half were working from home.", "This seismic shift in office life has brought about another social change, it has blurred the work-life boundary beyond recognition. Digital technologies had already eroded the difference for many people but Covid put the always-on culture into overdrive. \u201cICT-based mobile working has been growing for a decade,\u201d says Tina Weber, research manager at Eurofound. \u201cBut the pandemic has been transformational. It\u2019s completely changed the nature of how Europe works.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Remote staff are working an extra 48.5 minutes a day, according to a Harvard study. Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty Images", "WFH has clear pluses beyond comfortable clothes including greater workday flexibility, less time spent commuting and quality of life available outside cities. But the downside doesn\u2019t just involve Zoom fatigue: many people find they are working harder and longer. A Harvard study that analysed the emails and meetings of 3.1 million people in 16 global cities, found remote staff work 48.5 minutes more per day. Eurofound\u2019s data suggests that far from \u201cshirking from home\u201d those remote staff are twice as likely as office-based workers to be exceeding the EU\u2019s 48-hour working week. Almost a third of the remote army work in their free time several times a week \u2013 compared with fewer than 5% of office workers. Further research published this month found employees working from home in the UK, Austria, Canada and the US are at their computer an extra two hours a day.", "Professor Anna Cox, a computing and work-life balance expert at University College London, says that deterioration in work-life balance is mostly down to pressure and insecurity created by employers\u2019 use of tracking software. \u201cIt\u2019s left employees feeling like they\u2019re being watched every minute,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like there is an expectation to always be on call. It has such an impact on workers, particularly those who are not high-status managers.\u201d", "The loss of a clear work-life boundary has profound implications, particularly for women, who bear the brunt of childcare and domestic chores. Campaigners point to research showing rising levels of anxiety, depression, interrupted sleep patterns and burnout among the remote workforce, all of which they argue is partly a result of checking emails, keeping devices on and answering messages after hours. They say that employment law needs to catch up with the changed realities.", "\u201cAll too often we see management by fear,\u201d says Esther Lynch, the deputy general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), which represents 45 million workers across 38 European countries. \u201cThere needs to be a clear obligation on employers to ensure the right to disconnect for their employees.\u201d", "Although the EU\u2019s Working Time Directive, introduced in 2003, stipulates minimum daily and weekly rest periods, and work-life balance is one of the 20 principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, there is no right under EU law for those who work digitally to switch off outside working hours.", "A \u2018big win\u2019 for workers", "But the movement to legally protect leisure time is gaining ground. The European parliament voted overwhelmingly last month in favour of a resolution calling on the European commission to propose a law allowing those who work digitally to disconnect outside their working hours.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for European workers,\u201d says Alex Agius Saliba, the Maltese socialist politician who proposed the non-binding measure. \u201cThe result enables action to protect workers\u2019 mental health, wellbeing and private life. Hopefully, it will set a precedent around the world.\u201d", "The scale of the vote in favour showed \u201cthere are real concerns\u201d, Nicolas Schmit, the European commissioner for jobs and social rights, told the Guardian.", "Proponents of reform say lessons can be learned from France. It is 20 years since France introduced a 35-hour working week limit for companies with more than 20 employees \u2013 which later extended to smaller companies. That led to a ruling in 2004 by the Cour de Cassation, France\u2019s highest court, against an ambulance company\u2019s decision to fire a driver for not answering his personal phone outside of working hours.", "Pioneers in France then tested radical approaches, such as the days without emails attempted by camera manufacturer Canon in 2010 and by food company Sodexo in 2013. These were later abandoned. Others found a happier medium with less extreme measures \u2013 banking group BNP Paribas and network provider Orange introduced rules \u2013 in 2014 and 2016 respectively \u2013 against contacting employees on weekends, evenings or during their holidays, that are still in place today.", "In 2017, the then minister of labour, Myriam El Khomri, concerned about information overload (or info-obesity as she called it) introduced a law that required companies with more than 50 employees to draw up a charter thatclearly set out times when staff should not send or answer emails \u2013 in other words the world\u2019s first \u201cright to disconnect\u201d law.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Myriam El Khomri, pictured in the French national assembly in 2016, introduced the world\u2019s first \u2018right to disconnect\u2019 law.

In 2015 it shut down its internet server and mobile connections between 7pm and 7am. \u201cIt was quite effective,\u201d says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bouchet, director of innovation and services. \u201cBut it was also very constraining.\u201d", "The company loosened its approach in 2019, and staff now receive reminders in emails emphasising that they do not need to be answered out of hours. \u201cThe lighter system works well now. It gives us flexibility,\u201d says Bouchet. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s only because we sent the message first with the stricter policy and changed the workplace culture \u2013 that was very important.\u201d", "Critics say France\u2019s legislation only obliges companies to negotiate with staff representatives each year and in the event of disagreement to sign a charter \u2013 and often such agreements are non-binding. \u201cThe law has been a good thing,\u201d says Caroline Sauvajol-Rialland, professor at Sciences Po Paris and author of the book Infobesity. \u201cFrance became the first country in Europe to establish the right to disconnect rules. But the law is too light and many companies are ambivalent towards it.\u201d", "A recent survey of 34,000 workers by a coalition of French unions found 78% worked for companies that had not properly implemented the right to disconnect, 24% noted an increase in their workload during the pandemic and 30% were suffering from information overload. \u201cThere\u2019s this great challenge of lundimanche that we must tackle,\u201d Sauvajol-Rialland says, referring to a French portmanteau word for the blurring of Sunday into Monday.", "France\u2019s ministry of labour confirmed concerns when it published guidance in March reiterating that \u201cthe distinction between work time and leisure time must be clear and guarantee the employees\u2019 right to disconnect\u201d.", "In France, there would have to be an earthquake to stop the lunch break Natalia Zurowska", "Zurowska, moved from Poland to France in July to start a job in the sales department of a paint company in Marseille and with work split between home and the office, has fewer complaints now. I find that France is very good for work-life balance,\u201d she says. \u201cHere, the lunch break is sacred. There would have to be a war or earthquake to stop it. And I\u2019ve found nobody texts me or sends me emails outside of working hours.\u201d", "Other European countries including Spain and Italy have followed France\u2019s example. Ireland and Luxembourg are in the process of legislating to protect remote workers. In Germany, which has no legislation but is considered to have forward-thinking policies at company level, large businesses such as Volkswagen have limited email server connections on evenings and weekends.", "Pandemic level playing field", "The pandemic may have exacerbated the always-on pressure but it is also seen by campaigners as an opportunity to create a level playing field across the EU. \u201cFrance\u2019s example has been very beneficial and a very good case study,\u201d says Maltese MEP Saliba. \u201cBut we need to implement minimum requirements across Europe \u2013 and if member states want, they can go further.\u201d", "It won\u2019t be plain sailing. Business groups lobbied hard and won an amendment to the European parliament resolution that gives companies up to three years to implement voluntary agreements with social partners before any EU directive goes ahead.
