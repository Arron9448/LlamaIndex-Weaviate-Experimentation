As with bans on lighting up indoors, he says, so too with mandatory quotas for women on company boards, which the Dutch Parliament voted for this month after softer targets failed to move the needle much. Employers say they approve. Assuming all goes to plan, the Netherlands will join seven European countries (and California) in replacing the carrot of \u201cplease\u201d with the stick of \u201cor else\u201d to increase gender diversity.", "Will it make a difference? Quotas with consequences for firms\u2014such as fines in Italy or delisting in Norway\u2014have increased women\u2019s boardroom presence. Firms with more women seem to work better, with higher attendance and tougher monitoring of management. But no discernible impact on company performance has been identified. And the hoped-for trickle-down effect\u2014whereby more female board members would swell the ranks of female executives\u2014has yet to materialise.", "Still, quotas are here to stay. No country has lifted those put in place so far (though the Dutch insist theirs are temporary). Best practice is a work in progress, but some dos and don\u2019ts are becoming clear. Formalising selection processes to avoid a shortlist of chairman\u2019s chums, for example by hiring an external search firm, as most British firms but only two-fifths of those in America do, is a good idea; it helps avoid inadvertent double standards. So is broadening selection criteria away from a multitude of narrow ones, such as years of executive experience or industry expertise. Ensuring that more than one woman makes it onto the shortlist also helps; research has shown that a lonely shortlisted woman (or representative of a minority) has little chance of getting the job.", "Firms should avoid seeking a \u201cpink unicorn\u201d who ticks all conceivable boxes, recommends Laura Sanderson of Russell Reynolds, an executive-search firm. Spreading the desired skills over a number of future appointments makes it easier to find female candidates with at least some of them (or male ones, for that matter). Short, fixed terms for board members make renewal easier. This helps explain why in Britain, which has espoused them, boards are 30% female whereas in America, which has not, progress has flagged, despite corporate professions of gender equality.", "Critics say boards are the wrong thing to focus on\u2014a symptom of workplace gender inequality, not its cause. A study just published by Zo\u00eb Cullen of Harvard and Ricardo Perez-Truglia of the University of California, Los Angeles, highlights this. The authors studied promotion at a large Asian bank and found that men with male superiors rose up the hierarchy faster than those with female ones. Women managers do not appear to be similarly partial to female underlings, which may help explain why female board quotas have no effect on management\u2019s gender mix.", "The Dutch quota requires 30% of seats at large listed firms to be occupied by women. This translates to an extra 66 female board members, on top of the 122 who occupy such positions already, estimates Mijntje L\u00fcckerath from Tilburg University. Annet Aris, herself a member of several boards, admits the new law is \u201ca lot of noise for a small group of women\u201d. But, she adds, it is \u201cstill a very important signal\u201d."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "Skirting the issue - How to deal with board gender quotas", "pubDate": null, "summary": "And the hoped-for trickle-down effect\u2014whereby more female board members would swell the ranks of female executives\u2014has yet to materialise.\nShort, fixed terms for board members make renewal easier.\nThe authors studied promotion at a large Asian bank and found that men with male superiors rose up the hierarchy faster than those with female ones.\nWomen managers do not appear to be similarly partial to female underlings, which may help explain why female board quotas have no effect on management\u2019s gender mix.\nThis translates to an extra 66 female board members, on top of the 122 who occupy such positions already, estimates Mijntje L\u00fcckerath from Tilburg University.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/12/12/how-to-deal-with-board-gender-quotas"}
