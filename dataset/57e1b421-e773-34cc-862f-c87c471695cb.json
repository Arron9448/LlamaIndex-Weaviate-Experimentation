Rooted in the emotional side of our brain, one person's pain can be another person\u2019s pleasure. You might consider the qualities that I deem admirable to be inconsequential or even counterproductive and vice versa.", "Etymologically speaking, the word \u201chero\u201d means \u201cprotector\u201d or \u201cdefender,\u201d and so \u201cheroes\u201d are traditionally considered to hail from positions of strength \u2014 presidents, soldiers and in everyday life, first-responders \u2014 those who risk their lives to protect ours.", "In more recent times, sports figures, entertainers and celebrities of various stripes are often assigned heroic status. In fact, whenever they \u201cfall\u201d from their pedestals for any number of reasons, we often lament their dwindling numbers. What we\u2019re mostly mourning, I think, are people our children can look up to \u2014 as well as figures we can aspire to emulate ourselves.", "The truth of the matter, though, is that I think there are probably almost as many heroes out there as ever before \u2014 it\u2019s just that we\u2019re either valuing the wrong attributes in a person or we\u2019re looking for them in all the wrong places.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "As a young boy, I had a bulletin board in my bedroom plastered with sports clippings from the local newspapers and magazines. My childhood scrapbook was likewise filled with highlights from World Series and Stanley Cup championships.", "Looking back, I had a pretty low bar for earning my affection. New York Mets relief pitcher Neil Allen became a hero of mine in the early 1980s when he signed a scorebook for me along the first base line at Shea Stadium.", "I met retired shortstop Bud Harrelson at a baseball dinner at Baldwin\u2019s (N.Y.) Coral House. I\u2019ve had a warm spot for the scrappy baller ever since. In our backyard, I used to pretend I was Reggie Jackson, dropping my bat after another well-timed October home run.", "But as I matured and began to develop a better appreciation for what I thought really mattered, my attention turned away from sports stars and instead to people involved in pursuits and industries that I began falling in love with, specifically politics, radio and even old stars of the silver screen.", "In high school, I wrote down the names of the three people I really wanted to meet before I died \u2013 Ronald Reagan, Paul Harvey and Jimmy Stewart. I was eventually able to meet Reagan and Harvey, but not the lanky native of Indiana, Pa. All three men are long gone but remain high on my list of people I admire.", "Yet in recent years, as I approach midlife and beyond, my assessment of true heroism has shifted yet again.", "Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, and in a world that often ascribes status to the rich and the powerful, I have come to believe that true greatness is often quiet and even unassuming.", "Heroism is standing up and speaking out when the cultural elites try to bully you into sitting down and staying silent.", "It\u2019s a husband and wife remaining faithful to one another for a lifetime. It\u2019s caring for a spouse with Alzheimer\u2019s, a child with Down syndrome or a parent in the sunset of their life.", "It\u2019s a mother and father sacrificing for their children, forsaking personal luxuries in lieu of small shoes and expensive school supplies.", "It\u2019s the single mom working multiple jobs or the woman, unable to parent, making an adoption plan for her child.", "Heroes are pastors in the pulpits on Sunday mornings, proclaiming increasingly unpopular truths \u2014 and hours later sitting with a grieving family whose whole lives have been shattered by an incalculable loss.", "They\u2019re nurses and medical personnel patiently treating the sick, teachers helping a dyslexic child to read and volunteers at the soup kitchen or parents serving on the local PTA board.", "At my church, I know women who knit blankets for babies they\u2019ll never know and who bake cookies and bread for families they\u2019ll never meet.", "Heroes don\u2019t always make a million dollars \u2014 but they always make a difference in the life of somebody else.", "With the Senate impeachment trial beginning, and the presidential election well underway, you can be sure the rancor and the rhetoric are going to rise exponentially in the coming months of 2020.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "To paraphrase the old saying, \u201cWe ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d", "Through it all, take a big, deep breath and look for the heroes, many of whom won\u2019t be in the headlines but instead in your own homes and neighborhoods.", "CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA"], "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
