We had this incredible mid-1890s American raincoat with exaggerated gigot sleeves, for instance, which I have now paired with a coat from J.W. Anderson\u2019s fall 2020 collection. It\u2019s now such a strong juxtaposition\u2014stronger than it was. We also have one of John Galliano\u2019s repurposed looks from the Maison Margiela Artisanal spring 2020 collection, which I\u2019ve paired with Saint Laurent\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d mink and crocodile jacket from his fall 1960 collection for Christian Dior that we acquired several years ago.", "A recently acquired shift dress from Patrick Kelly from the \u201980s will be paired this pearl-encrusted dress by Olivier Rousteing for Balmain, which was shown in 2012 and again at fall 2020 couture. Photo: Gorunway.com", "I also wanted to include more designers that weren\u2019t so well known and maybe had been written out of fashion history. So I paired a Frederick Loeser & Co. riding habit from circa 1897 with a Victor Joris suit from 1968 that Baby Jane Holzer had given us. We were researching Joris as we wrote the label, but he served as assistant to both Dior and Balmain.", "The bigger change to the curation was really a direct response to Black Lives Matter. When I first worked on the curation, I wasn\u2019t as focused on issues of race and ethnicity or gender and sexuality. It was purely aesthetic: I was looking at changes in silhouettes from 1870 through to the present and creating the strongest juxtapositions with the \u201cinterventions.\u201d But with the social-justice movements of this spring and summer, I looked at the curation and knew I wanted to include more Black, indigenous, people-of-color designers. BLM has made me reflect on fashion curation more generally and the need to create new, more inclusive definitions. I think that we need to readdress the misperception that fashion is exclusively Western, and we need to construct more diverse fashion histories and narratives. This is something that I\u2019m thinking about for future shows; every decision that I make going forward has to be informed by race and ethnicity and gender and sexuality. The awareness can\u2019t go away; this is a lifelong commitment.", "An early iteration of the little black dress from the Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel, ca. 1927 (left), takes on a more literal meaning in this garment (right) from Off-White c/o Virgil Abloh, 2018. Photographed by Ethan James Green, Vogue, November 2020", "Initially, in one pairing, for example, I had Chanel\u2019s iconic little black dress from ca. 1927 with a rather literal copy by Norell from 1965. But I\u2019d always had Virgil Abloh\u2019s \u201cLittle Black Dress\u201d in the back of my mind: equally as strong but more ironic. And I wanted very much for Stephen Burrows to be part of the \u201970s group, but we had nothing of his in the collection that was black; it was all his signature color blocking, so I spent months scouring eBay, 1stDibs, Etsy, and I managed to find two black dresses that I bought for the museum. Out of the two, I decided to include a piece with his trademark lettuce edging finished with red topstitching. That led me to pair him with Lamine Kouyate of XULY.B\u00ebt, who also finishes his garments with red topstitching. It\u2019s become one of my favorite comparisons in the show, and I would never have made the connection without pushing myself to think about things differently."], "authors": ["Andrew Bolton", "Andrew Bolto"], "keywords": ["created", "met", "black", "collection", "little", "curation", "need", "delayed", "opening", "opportunity", "dress", "paired", "wanted", "include", "fashion"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
