In a country where protest politics reign large, students are on a mission: to overturn a bill that, in the name of bringing order to unruly universities, foresees the creation of disciplinary councils and a special campus police force. \u201cOur demand is simple. The educational bill has to be withdrawn,\u201d said Grigoriou. \u201cIt\u2019s a repressive law that far from serving our needs only serves the fake needs of a conservative few.\u201d", "In his third year of a business administration course, the 20-year-old admits he now spends more time \u201con the frontline\u201d than behind his books. But he is far from alone. Nationwide there have been growing student protests against the legislation, which is seen as rolling back rights gained since the restoration of democracy in 1974.", "With MPs due to vote on the bill late on Thursday, following three days of heated debate, demonstrators clashed with riot police in Athens and Thessaloniki as opposition against the centre-right government\u2019s attempt to overhaul the sector intensified.", "Inside the 300-seat House tensions were also high as the main opposition leader, Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras, slammed the administration for using the pandemic to pass unacceptable laws. Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis insisted it was not the police but democracy that will be installed in colleges. \u201cThe aim is to give back public universities to their natural occupants,\u201d he told the chamber.", "One of Europe\u2019s smaller countries, Greece has 24 state universities and more than 600,000 students, in a reflection of how tertiary education is seen as a lever to social mobility. But chaos also abounds. Tales of lawlessness on Greek campuses \u2013 particularly in Athens \u2013 are legion, attributed in part to a law that long prohibited police from entering university grounds, in memory of those killed in 1973 when the colonels\u2019 regime violently crushed an uprising at the Athens Polytechnic.", "Although repealed by Mitsotakis within weeks of assuming office in 2019, the legacy of the so-called asylum law lingers. In urban centres, campuses previously known as no-go zones for police have become synonymous with crime and decay. Drug peddling, sexual assault and the presence of anarchists and other anti-establishment groups on university grounds have all been blamed for driving ever more Greeks to seek higher education abroad.", "Students clash with riot police in Athens. Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images", "\u201cWe hear of outrageous transgressions of security, even professors being attacked in lecture theatres, and of vandalism and theft,\u201d said Prof Kevin Featherstone, who teaches contemporary Greek studies at the London School of Economics. \u201cAsylum rights born in a different era have been grossly abused to the detriment of all.\u201d", "Criticism of the bill has focused on the plans for an unarmed police force. Empowered to arrest students perceived to be involved in criminal activity, the 1,030-strong body of specially trained men and women would be able to call in riot police if deemed necessary. For leftwing parties who have viewed the asylum law as sacrosanct \u2013 and are mindful of the role of campuses as recruiting grounds \u2013 the prospect of any police presence comes perilously close to erasing freedom of expression.", "\u201cNo country in the world has police on university sites,\u201d said Syriza\u2019s education spokesperson Nikos Filis, noting that the entire academic community and even the police were against the proposals. \u201cThis is the government taking its law and order agenda to new heights. Why not reinstate the security guards who were fired when Greece signed up to [EU-mandated] austerity during the economic crisis? A police force will simply add fuel to the fire.\u201d", "For Niki Kerameus, Athens\u2019 education minister and the architect of the reforms, the legislation far exceeds the issue of police surveillance limited to only \u201cfour or five\u201d universities, she says, where the problem of security is acute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a horizontal measure and in time the body may even be removed if there is no longer need for it,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s simply not true to say that elsewhere police don\u2019t intervene when criminal incidents occur on campuses, because they do.\u201d", "At 40, the Harvard-educated lawyer is among the youngest ministers in the government and has dreams of Greece becoming an educational hub in south-east Europe. To get there, she says, the country finally has to grapple with the perennial problems that have plagued higher education. \u201cOur tertiary education system has tremendous potential, proven by the fact that so many of our graduates go on to study at the best universities abroad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to unleash that potential. And to do that we need to take certain actions.\u201d", "Niki Kerameus, Greece\u2019s education minister, in parliament. Photograph: Aristidis Vafeiadakis/Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock", "In a first, the bill deals with the phenomenon of \u201ceternal students\u201d \u2013 40% of Greek undergraduates continue their studies into middle age \u2013 as well as faculty evaluation and raising university admission standards.", "\u201cThis is 2021,\u201d said the minister, insisting that disciplinary committees were necessary because rules had never been enforced. \u201cWe have to deal with issues and take action where there is offence, be that plagiarism or destruction of university property. It\u2019s plain common sense and long overdue. This isn\u2019t about right of left. It\u2019s about what is best for our universities and future generations.\u201d", "Under Kerameus\u2019s watch, undergraduate courses in English have begun to be taught as part of a drive to attract foreign students and forge partnerships with leading universities in the US and elsewhere. But that, too, has drawn criticism from the opposition, who accuse the government of being hellbent on privatising tertiary education at the expense of the public nature of universities.", "Not all students are opposed. Katerina Tsitomenea, a law undergraduate at the University of Athens, agrees the changes are overdue. \u201cThere are some strange types on campus and you don\u2019t always feel secure,\u201d she said. \u201cI have friends who study law in the UK and I\u2019m always surprised at how different the environment is at universities there.\u201d", "For Featherstone, who sat on Greece\u2019s National Council for Research and Technology as its first foreign member, the furore is tantamount to a culture war over how Greece should develop.", "\u201cWhat we are seeing is part of a long-term conflict between two sides of Greek society. One is international-looking, seeks meritocracy, has liberal values and is aspirational for Greece to compete in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other is insular, fearful, non-meritocratic, dismisses excellence and wants academic institutions to operate on very different values. It\u2019s a culture war through and through.\u201d"], "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "keywords": ["minister", "dispute", "education", "barricades", "universities", "greece", "students", "law", "greek", "university", "athens", "bill"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
