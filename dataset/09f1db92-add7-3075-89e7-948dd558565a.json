The four artists had not met one another before being nominated in May, though their letter speaks of a \"shared ethos that runs across our otherwise very different practices.\"", "\"The politics we deal with differ greatly, and for us it would feel problematic if they were pitted against each other, with the implication that one was more important, significant or more worthy of attention than the others,\" the artists wrote.", "The group used its acceptance speech to criticize the rise of the right-wing politics and the ruling Conservative Party's so-called \"hostile environment\" immigration policy.
