It\u2019s an affair that continues for more than three decades. The novel asks: is carnal desire more intense and profound when outside the strictures of marriage? It\u2019s a question posed by many writers, as adultery and other variants on illicit romance have always been key themes in fiction.", "On which note, here are my 10 favourite novels on the agonies and ecstasies of the extramarital adventure:", "1. The End of the Affair by Graham Greene", "A male novelist \u2013 unmarried, living a solipsistic existence in south London during the blitz \u2013 begins an affair with a senior civil servant\u2019s wife. He becomes obsessed with claiming Sarah as his own. His jealousy is fuelled by the despair of knowing that he will probably never have a proper life with her. And then there is her entrenched Catholicism. A brilliantly constructed novel about the way in which passion can often become a game of obsessive ownership.", "2. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert", "It could be argued that the modern novel commenced with Flaubert\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 because it stands as the first work of fiction that grappled with the nightmare of marriage at its most prosaic. Of course Flaubert shocked the guardians of moral propriety by having his not-so\u2013bright heroine \u2013 whose has married a third-tier provincial doctor \u2013 starting an affair with a military man in town on secondment. Flaubert not only invented the so-called \u201cdesperate housewife\u201d genre, but also spoke a truth that few then or now want to recognise: stepping out from the bonds of fidelity is often a response to boredom.", "3. The Easter Parade by Richard Yates", "Yes, Yates\u2019s 1961 novel Revolutionary Road remains a postwar American classic. But 15 years later he produced another masterpiece of national despair. The Easter Parade follows the sad destinies of two sisters who become unhinged after their parents\u2019 divorce. Sarah goes on to be a sad housewife. Emily makes a disastrous marriage, drifts from one bad affair to another, quietly embraces alcoholism. What Yates captures brilliantly in this tightly constructed novel \u2013 which spans five decades \u2013 is the way that drifting from one casual fling (often with a married man) to the next becomes an accumulated articulation of deep inner despair \u2026 and an even deeper malaise at the heart of the country.", "4. The Awakening by Kate Chopin", "An absolute gem, first published in 1899 \u2013 now regarded as a landmark in American literature, even if many an upholder of the puritanical status quo back then condemned it as immoral. It\u2019s the story of Edna, who has married well and is comfortably placed in the world of the New Orleans bourgeoisie. But she has begun to question the way society has forced her into the role of adoring spouse and baby provider. When a certain young man makes his romantic yearnings known \u2013 and when another suitor makes an amorous move while Edna\u2019s husband is out of town \u2013 well, in true 19th-century style it all ends tragically. Chopin defied established proprieties by showing the sexual desires of a married woman outside the stifling conjugal bed.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Charged carnality \u2026 Jude Law as Karenin and Keira Knightley in the title role of Anna Karenina (2012). Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Allstar/Universal Pictures", "5. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy", "One of the central cornerstones in the canon of world literature; a great state-of-the-nation novel that also deals with the absolute messiness of the human heart and the way that the biggest mystery in life might just happen to be yourself. An illicit love affair between two aristos also becomes a sweeping portrait of tsarist Russia and a daring (for its time) treatise on the charged carnality of the extramarital. And it remains a profound statement about how that very human pursuit of happiness is always just that \u2013 a pursuit.", "6. Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie", "Winner of a mid-80s Pulitzer prize, Lurie\u2019s novel is a sharp look at a lonely, single, deeply unloved American female academic on sabbatical in London. Her intellectual rigour and her misanthropy are upended when she meets, on the flight over, a gauche, chain-smoking, defiantly unintellectual fellow from Tulsa. Although she dismisses him initially as a married yahoo, something extraordinary develops between them. A smart, quietly piercing novel about love\u2019s improbable narratives.", "7. Deception by Philip Roth", "A much underrated novel from Roth\u2019s expatriate London years. A writer named Philip, immersed in midlife blues, is having an affair with an elegant Englishwoman still some years away from the precipice of turning 40 but stuck in a catastrophic marriage. A novel almost entirely composed of dialogue, its pre/post-coital conversations speak volumes about the furtive, edgy passionate intimacy that two people bring to the hours they set aside for their clandestine adventure.", "8. Rabbit, Run by John Updike", "Though Updike was looked upon in the 1960s as the master of suburban adultery, please go back to his early masterpiece Rabbit, Run for its affecting yet uncompromising portrait of failed American promise and the stifling tedium of marriage. As it follows a high school basketball star whose life shifts into day-to-day banality after he marries his pregnant sweetheart and tries to make ends meet with a dismal sales job, we see him drift into an adulterous affair. The inherent musicality of Updike\u2019s prose is here married to a vision of American life that underscores the need for eroticism as a way of escaping the prosaic.", "9. The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera", "Can you adore your spouse but still have multiple affairs? Why should sex outside love (and the vows of marriage) be considered a breach of all sorts of societal norms? To be compulsively attached to the sex act \u2026 is this an addiction or a positive existential choice? These complex moral questions, for which there are no definitive answers, are played out in a Czechoslovakia reeling under Soviet domination at the height of the cold war. Kundera\u2019s ever-dazzling novel is finely attuned to the contradictory interplay of the libido and the quasi-stability of long-term love.", "Top 10 books about escape from captivity | Toby Litt Read more", "10. The Postman Always Rings Twice by James M Cain", "Cain was a seriously great writer working in the genre of crime fiction; a chronicler of small desperate lives in the Great American Nowhere. The Postman \u2026 is a straightforward tale of a drifter who ends up at a diner in a dusty corner of California owned by a blob of a guy \u2013 who also has a garage and a very young, sultry American wife, bored to despair by her husband. Naturally, the drifter picks up her sexual need. Naturally he fulfils it. Naturally they begin to plot her husband\u2019s death. Written with a spare, dustbowl lyricism it is the best adultery noir ever written.", "\u2022 Isabelle in the Afternoon by Douglas Kennedy is published by Hutchinson on 9 January.
