First, dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water. Then, in a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeasty water. Bring the dough together, adding more of the warm water as you go, until you have a soft dough. You may not need to use all the water -- you're looking for the dough to just come together.", "2. Lightly flour your work surface and turn out the dough. Knead it into a smooth dough; you may need to add more flour as you go so that it's not too sticky. Form the dough into a ball, put it in a clean bowl, cover loosely, and set aside in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours.", "3. Divide the risen dough in half. Gently pull and roll out each portion on a floured surface, handling the dough with care and letting it stretch and fall over the backs of your hands until it is a uniform thickness.", "4. Top the dough as desired: Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce over the dough. Top with sliced mozzarella, a good grating of Parmigiano, and some fresh basil leaves.
