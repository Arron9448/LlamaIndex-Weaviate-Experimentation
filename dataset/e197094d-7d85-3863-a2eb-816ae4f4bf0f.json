Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Federal regulators on Wednesday issued highly critical findings from their inspection of a Baltimore plant that was forced to throw out up to 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s coronavirus vaccine and ordered to temporarily stop all production. The Food and Drug Administration cited a series of shortcomings at the massive plant, which is operated by Emergent BioSolutions. The inspection was triggered by reports that Emergent workers had contaminated a batch of Johnson & Johnson doses with the harmless virus that is used to deliver AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, which is also manufactured at the plant. The violations included failure to properly disinfect the factory and its equipment, as well as failure to follow proper procedures designed to prevent contamination of doses and to ensure the strength and purity of the vaccine manufactured there. In a 12-page report, the inspectors cited a total of nine violations, ranging from the design of the building to improperly trained employees. The inspection was finished on Tuesday. In a statement, the F.D.A. noted that it has not authorized Emergent to distribute any doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and that no vaccine manufactured at the plant has been released for use in the United States. AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is not yet authorized for use in the United States, and all the Johnson & Johnson doses that have been administered in the country so far were manufactured overseas. At the agency\u2019s request, all production at the factory has been halted. \u201cWe will not allow the release of any product until we feel confident that it meets our expectations for quality,\u201d the statement from Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.\u2019s acting commissioner, and Dr. Peter Marks, the agency\u2019s top vaccine regulator, said. The agency said it was working with Emergent to fix the problems. The inspectors castigated Emergent\u2019s response to the discovery last month that Johnson & Johnson doses had been contaminated with AstraZeneca\u2019s virus. The incident \u201chas not been fully investigated,\u201d they wrote. For instance, they said, Emergent failed to review the movement of workers between the zones in which each vaccine was manufactured. \u201cThere is no assurance that other batches have not been contaminated,\u201d they said. The inspectors found that workers frequently moved between AstraZeneca\u2019s and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s manufacturing zones without documenting that they had showered and changed their gowns as required. In one day, for instance, more than a dozen employees moved from one zone to another, but only one documented having showered, they said. Workers also failed to properly handle manufacturing waste, creating risks of contamination in the warehouse where raw materials are stored, the inspectors found. They also cited peeling paint, crowded conditions and other issues with the facility. Emergent said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cwhile we are never satisfied to see shortcomings in our manufacturing facilities or process, they are correctable and we will take swift action to remedy them.\u201d In its own statement, Johnson & Johnson said it had already stepped up its oversight of Emergent, its subcontractor, and that it would \u201censure that all of F.D.A.\u2019s observations are addressed promptly and comprehensively.\u201d One major change has already been made: AstraZeneca will no longer be manufactured at the plant, a move that federal officials insisted upon earlier this month to limit the chance of cross-contamination with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "The U.S. military gives initial vaccine doses to all but eight of the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.

Doug Mills/The New York Times All but eight of the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, the U.S. Southern Command said on Tuesday. Biden administration officials said that the Department of Defense had expanded vaccine availability to all 40 detainees starting on Monday, the day that all people 16 years and older became eligible for vaccination in the United States. The Southern Command, which oversees the detention center, first sought permission from the Trump administration to vaccinate the detainees in a Dec. 23 memo that described the prison population at Guant\u00e1namo as \u201ca high-risk community,\u201d and invoked both \u201cthe Geneva Convention and Department of Defense guidance.\u201d \u201cThirty-two of the detainees have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,\u201d the command said in a statement. Military officials declined to say whether the other eight detainees were offered the first shot of the two-shot Moderna Covid-19 vaccine but refused. The vaccines are not mandatory for the military or civilian Defense Department employees and were offered to the detainees on a voluntary basis. Many of them are approaching their second decade in U.S. detention and have chronic illnesses. The oldest is 73 and has a heart condition, diabetes and other geriatric illnesses. The Biden administration froze initial plans to offer them the vaccine on Feb. 1, because elected officials and families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks accused the Defense Department of putting terrorism suspects ahead of the American people, who were only just beginning to get access to the vaccines in substantial numbers at that point. Vaccination rates have risen substantially since then across the country, which was nearing President Biden\u2019s goal of administering 200 million doses by his 100th day in office. Defense officials also went forward with vaccinating the detainees this week in part because of what appears to be a significant rate of refusal to take the vaccines by adults at the base of about 5,500 residents, including at the detention center, which has a staff of 1,500 guards and civilians. As of April 1, according to health officials at the base, 47 percent of those eligible had not had a dose.", "In the U.S. vaccination campaign, \u2018the last miles here are going to be the toughest.\u2019 A vaccination site in Los Angeles County this month.

Allison Zaucha for The New York Times Now that the United States has met President Biden\u2019s goal of having Covid-19 vaccines available to all adults, health officials around the country are hitting what appears to be a soft ceiling: More than half the nation\u2019s adults have received at least one dose, but it will take hard work to convince the rest. The risk is that it will take so long that the nation will not be able to reach herd immunity in time to stop worrisome new variants from evading the vaccines. Polls show that vaccine hesitancy is on the decline as more people see their friends and relatives get vaccinated without incident.

Prakash Mathema/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Doctors have confirmed the first coronavirus cases among climbers trying to scale Mount Everest, a troubling sign for Nepal\u2019s effort to reopen its lucrative high-altitude tourism industry. Multiple climbers tested positive at CIWEC Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital, after being flown there in recent days from Everest Base Camp, the hospital\u2019s medical director said on Wednesday. The medical director, Prativa Pandey, declined to offer additional information about the cases, saying only that officials at Everest Base Camp, the starting point for expeditions on the world\u2019s tallest peak, were trying to ensure that groups of climbers were not mingling with one another. \u201cWe are taking it up with the health ministry to see what we can do for the safety of climbers and staff up there,\u201d Dr. Pandey said. Nepal has reopened Everest and seven other peaks of 26,200 feet and above to small numbers of mountaineers in the hopes of restarting its tourism sector. It suspended all commercial climbing expeditions last year \u2014 a risky move for the small, tourism-dependent Himalayan country, which has been battling a resurgence of the coronavirus along with the rest of South Asia. The government has issued 371 climbing permits to Everest hopefuls, and tourism officials say the number could increase. Journeys to the summit, 5.5 miles above sea level, begin at Everest Base Camp, where climbers stay for roughly two months to acclimate to the altitude. To guard against an outbreak, Nepal\u2019s government established a temporary high-altitude health care unit at the base camp, at an elevation of 17,600 feet, and expedition operators regularly test climbers for the coronavirus. Officials have mandated masks and social distancing, and said that climbers who were suspected of being infected would be flown out for testing. A government doctor at the base camp said that three foreign climbers from his clinic were flown to Kathmandu this month after complaining of Covid-like symptoms. At least one, he later learned, tested positive. The doctor said that other climbers had developed similar symptoms and were also flown to Kathmandu for testing. He had no information on their cases. Mingma Sherpa, the chairman of Seven Summit Treks, Nepal\u2019s largest expedition operator, said that attempts to scale Everest would continue even if some climbers were infected with the virus. \u201cExpeditions won\u2019t be canceled,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point of returning or giving up climbing after reaching base camp.\u201d In other news from around the world: India shattered its single-day records for new coronavirus infections and deaths, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said a second wave had hit the country \u201clike a storm.\u201d The health ministry on Wednesday reported 293,018 cases and 2,023 deaths over 24 hours, eclipsing the highs set in recent days. After averaging roughly 11,000 cases per day in early February, India may soon become the only country aside from the United States to surpass 300,000 daily cases. Mr. Modi, who faces growing criticism over his government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, urged states to avoid lockdowns and instead focus on \u201cmicro-containment zones\u201d to reduce economic harm. But the second largest state, Maharashtra, was expected to announce a lockdown for 15 days beginning on Wednesday night.", "The outbreak in India has prompted neighboring Sri Lanka to postpone plans for a two-way air travel bubble, The Hindu newspaper reported. Less than two weeks ago, India\u2019s government said it had finalized an agreement with Sri Lanka, a small island nation whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism, to allow special commercial flights between the two countries. Indian tourists accounted for nearly one-fifth of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign visitors in January 2020. Infections in Sri Lanka, which reported 367 new cases on Wednesday, have declined sharply since mid-February, but officials warned this week that a new variant was spreading in the country for the first time.", "France said on Wednesday that travelers arriving from India would be subjected to a mandatory 10-day quarantine, adding to a growing list of countries that the French authorities have restricted travel from to prevent the arrival of worrisome virus variants.
