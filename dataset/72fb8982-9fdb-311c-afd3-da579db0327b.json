We\u2019re fortunate the carnage wasn\u2019t greater.", "That the attempted coup failed shouldn\u2019t blind us to its significance or the stain it has left on America. Nor to the importance of holding those responsible fully accountable.", "Trump\u2019s culpability is beyond dispute.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no question the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. He lit the flame,\u201d said Elizabeth Cheney, the No3 House Republican.", "Trump should be impeached, convicted and removed from office \u2013 immediately.", "To let the clock run out on his presidency and allow Trump to seek the office again would signal that attempted coups are part of the American system. If Senate Republicans can install a new supreme court justice in eight days, Trump can be removed from office within 12.", "He should then be arrested and tried for inciting violence and sedition \u2013 along with Donald Trump Jr and Rudy \u201ctrial-by-combat\u201d Giuliani.", "Those who attacked the Capitol should also be prosecuted. They have no first amendment right to try to overthrow the US government.", "Trump\u2019s accomplices on Capitol Hill, most notably the Texas senator Ted Cruz and Missouri senator Josh Hawley, should be forced to resign.", "Knowing Trump\u2019s allegations of voting fraud were false, Cruz and Hawley led the move to exclude Biden electors \u2013 even after the storming of the Capitol \u2013 thereby lending Trump\u2019s claims credibility.", "The United States constitution says \u201cno Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress\u201d who \u201cshall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against\u201d the constitution, \u201cor given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof\u201d.", "Both Cruz and Hawley are eyeing runs for the presidency in 2024. They should be barred from running.", "Other abettors are trying to distance themselves, but their conversions come too late.", "Senator Lindsey Graham now says Trump must \u201cunderstand that his actions were the problem, not the solution\u201d, and criticizes the White House for making \u201caccusations that cannot be proven\u201d.", "Graham was one of Trump\u2019s key attack dogs, even bullying state election officials to change voting tallies. If Graham is not forced to resign, he should at least be censured and stripped of his ranking membership on the Senate judiciary committee.", "The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Vice-President Michael Pence finally broke with Trump, but only after remaining mute as Trump lied and bullied his way through the last eight weeks, thereby signaling agreement with his preposterous claims.", "McConnell should also resign or be censured and stripped of committee assignments. Pence should be barred from public office.", "Some officials have resigned in response to the attempted coup. The transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said it was \u201centirely avoidable\u201d and the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, told Trump there was \u201cno mistake the impact your rhetoric had\u201d. Other Trumpers are reportedly jumping ship too.", "Yet before Wednesday most of them defended Trump\u2019s antics, lavished him with praise and did his dirty work. Their complicity should forever haunt their reputations and consciences.", "Other accessories are Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg, of Facebook, and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, YouTube\u2019s parent company.", "For four years, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have functioned as Trump\u2019s megaphones, amplifying his every lie and rant. When pressured to remove Trump\u2019s fabrications about the election, they labeled them \u201cdisputed\u201d.", "Twitter has now permanently suspended Trump, preventing him from sending messages to his more than 88 million followers \u201cdue to the risk of further incitement for violence\u201d. Facebook has banned him indefinitely. YouTube should as well.", "But why did it take an attempted coup for them to act?", "Many business leaders now denouncing the violence enthusiastically bankrolled Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, knowing full well who he was and what he was capable of doing. And they\u2019ve had no qualms about advertising on his largest megaphones, including Fox News. All are complicit because they knew Trump would stop at nothing.", "Fox News\u2019s mendacious hosts and producers have no excuse. After repeatedly telling Trump supporters the election was stolen, they\u2019re now saying the attempted coup was \u201cunderstandable\u201d because Trump supporters believed the election was stolen. Morally, if not legally, they share responsibility for this travesty.", "All are parts of the ecosystem that led to Trump\u2019s sedition. That ecosystem is still in place.", "Those who say we should \u201clook forward\u201d to a new administration and forget or dismiss what occurred last week are delusional.
