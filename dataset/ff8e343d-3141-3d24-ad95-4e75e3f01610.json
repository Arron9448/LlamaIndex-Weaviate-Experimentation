He was also one of three authors behind a 2018 hoax wherein the trio got seven bogus papers published in various scholarly journals in an attempt to discredit the academic rigor of fields like gender studies\u2014a move decried (and defended) by many of his fellow academics.

That would be a dream come true to me.\u201d", "Boghossian actually did write a number of sci-fi scripts with his friend Christopher Johnson, co-founder of The Onion. Unfortunately none of them were ever produced. \u201cWe wrote something that we wanted to watch, and then we were told repeatedly that it was too intelligent and that no one would watch it,\u201d Boghossian says. \u201cI think it would have been a niche hit. I think people consistently underestimate the type of people who like sci-fi.\u201d", "As a philosopher, Boghossian is used to tackling tough questions, but one question he can\u2019t answer is why he spends so much time watching science fiction.", "\u201cI have no idea why I\u2019m obsessed with science fiction TV and movies,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I have that rather unusual desire.

I\u2019ll give you an example. My son wanted to leave the house, and it was cold\u2014we live in Portland, Oregon\u2014and I said, \u2018Get a coat or you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u2019 And my wife\u2019s an MD/PhD professor of medicine, and she said, \u2018No, that\u2019s not true.\u2019 And instead of me saying \u2018What\u2019s your evidence for that?\u2019 or anything, I immediately became defensive and said, \u2018Of course it\u2019s true.\u2019 Think of the incredible arrogance of that, saying \u2018Of course it\u2019s true.\u2019 What basis do I have saying that with no evidence whatsoever? \u2026 [But] if you hear something so frequently, particularly if it comes from people who love you, those things have a masked emotional valence to them, so you\u2019re much more likely to assign higher confidence to those.\u201d", "Peter Boghossian on How to Have Impossible Conversations:", "\u201cThe book has 36 techniques, and 35 of them are unbelievably well-sourced from hostage negotiations, cult exiting, drug and alcohol programs, applied epistemology, etc. The other technique is something I\u2019ve been playing with, a speculative technique. [The book] synthesizes these very dense bodies of literature and breaks it down into techniques. \u2026 The point of the book is to empower people to speak across divides. You know, someone believes something, a person is a Trump supporter or Elizabeth Warren or whatever it is, or this person believes in a big wall or no wall, everyone should have a gun or no one should have a gun. \u2018I can\u2019t talk to a person like this.\u2019 Well the point of the book is to empower people to have those impossible conversations.\u201d", "Peter Boghossian on the principle of charity:", "\u201cUnless you\u2019re a psychopath, you feel things deeply, and things have a moral resonance to them, and I think that one of the tragedies of the age, which is exacerbated by social media, is that we don\u2019t ascribe\u2014in philosophy we call it the \u2018hermeneutic of charity,\u2019 and in anthropology as well\u2014we don\u2019t ascribe charitable interpretations for why people believe things or why people do things. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad people, it\u2019s just that they have certain information and they\u2019re acting from that information. One of the things we could do to really heal our current divide, and perhaps put more civility into our society, which in my opinion we\u2019re in desperate need of, is just to stop walking around assuming everybody has bad intentions.\u201d", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy", "Powered Outbrain", "Kayla Lacour", "Echo Esc_Html", "Wired_Get_The_Byline_Name", "Related_Video"], "keywords": ["dreams", "tv", "boghossian", "ive", "writing", "things", "science", "book", "philosopher", "scifi", "watch", "dont", "think", "true"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
