Vice\u2014the outlet that first reported on the video\u2014was quick to highlight the way that face-swap technology could be used to manufacture a wholly new form of \u201crevenge porn,\u201d one in which victims could find themselves featured in explicit sexual media without ever taking off their clothes in front of a camera.", "Two years later, a number of powerful entities have taken steps to push back against the threat posed by deceptive videos, especially in the realm of politics. Facebook announced a ban on deepfakes last week, while Congress has lately earmarked millions of dollars for the development of technology to detect them. But the fear of sexual deepfakes still looms large in conversations about online harassment. Politicians, celebrities, even regular, unfamous women with vindictive ex-boyfriends have all been held up as potential victims of this high-tech form of abuse. Less discussed, however, is the impact deepfakes will have on a wholly different group of women: the actors whose bodies and sexual performances are used as the basis for manufactured pornography.", "Even as deepfake technology has gotten significantly more convincing, it\u2019s still rare to see a video that\u2019s been created completely from scratch. In most cases, deepfake creators are just grafting one person\u2019s face onto another person\u2019s body\u2014rendering, for instance, the porn performer Pepper XO into the movie star Gal Gadot.", "Porn performers whose scenes are manipulated in this fashion aren\u2019t the direct subjects of this abuse. Most of the time, they\u2019ll never even know about the deepfakes that were based off of their work. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the sense of violation that many industry members feel when confronted with the phenomenon\u2014or the fears they have about how this technology could be used to harass and abuse them, as well.", "Sex worker Sydney Leathers hasn\u2019t come across any deepfakes based on her porn scenes, but she is intimately familiar with what it feels like to have her work used to harass and debase another woman. In January 2019, a bathtub selfie that Leathers had posted to Instagram began circulating online, repackaged as a naked photo of newly elected congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.", "For Leathers, who only heard about the photo once it had been debunked and correctly identified in the media, the experience was deeply upsetting. It felt, she says, \u201ca little violating,\u201d particularly since Ocasio-Cortez is a politician she likes and respects. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re a part of [the harassment of other women],\u201d Leathers continues. But when someone repackages your porn scene as a tool of abuse, you don\u2019t get a choice in the matter.", "The idea of being weaponized as a deepfake feels \u201cmore objectifying than any of the made up reasons why people who hate porn think it\u2019s objectifying,\u201d says Ela Darling, an adult film performer and director of marketing at ViRo Club, an erotic VR platform. \u201cThat would literally make me into a tool they\u2019re using to harm someone else. I\u2019d feel eviscerated.\u201d The knowledge that she\u2019d play no active role in the creation of the deepfake doesn\u2019t provide Darling with much comfort. \u201cI would feel used,\u201d she says, describing the idea as \u201cskin-crawlingly gross.\u201d", "Working as a porn performer already means getting accustomed to having your image repackaged and distributed in ways that you\u2019re not fully comfortable with. Numerous performers have had the experience of seeing a scene that was shot in one context appear online with a completely different framing. A loving scene involving a black performer and a white performer may wind up being advertised with racist keywords and descriptions; a performer in her mid-twenties may be shocked to see herself labeled as a \u201cMILF\u201d or \u201ccougar\u201d when a scene lands online."], "authors": ["Lux Alptraum", "Lux Alptrau"], "keywords": ["performers", "technology", "deepfakes", "leathers", "performer", "online", "feel", "deepfake", "used", "scene", "porn", "harms", "adult"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
