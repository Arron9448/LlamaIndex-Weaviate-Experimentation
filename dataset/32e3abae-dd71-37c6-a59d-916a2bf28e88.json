She spoke with typical precision. In Germany, which on Wednesday prolonged its current lockdown until at least March 7, things are bad: Since October, cases have soared \u2014 they are only now starting to come down \u2014 and over 50,000 people have died. An atmosphere of grim resignation prevails.", "But wasn\u2019t Germany one of the global leaders in pandemic control during the first wave? Didn\u2019t Germans enjoy a fairly normal summer of trips to the beach and meeting with friends at beer gardens? Didn\u2019t their children return to school, as normal, in August and September?", "Yes, yes and yes. But when fall came, things started to go wrong. And it wasn\u2019t bad luck. It was politics.", "Last spring, as the virus rampaged through Europe, German policymakers acted swiftly and with rare unity. In March, schools, shops and restaurants were closed and gatherings of more than two people banned. After a few weeks, cases dropped and the country started to reopen gradually in April and May. Over the summer, there were very few restrictions \u2014 and very little Covid-19."], "authors": ["Anna Sauerbrey"], "keywords": ["summer", "lost", "times", "normal", "didnt", "wasnt", "control", "yes", "germany", "meeting", "started", "things", "coronavirus", "york"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
