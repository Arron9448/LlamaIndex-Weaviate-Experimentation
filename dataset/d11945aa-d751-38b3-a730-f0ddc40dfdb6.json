Inside? Model shoes she\u2019d cobbled together out of cardboard, sellotape, and wire. \u201cThey were almost childlike,\u201d she recalls with a chuckle. \u201cBut the production department was delighted.\u201d", "If you follow Toogood\u2019s work, that anecdote isn\u2019t surprising. The British designer has an absolute dedication to form over anything else: her Roly Poly chair, with its baby elephant-esque shape, is iconic and instantly recognizable. So when she teamed up with the shoe brand, there\u2019s no way she was just going to slap on a color, send it over in a PDF, and call it a day. \u201cWe aren\u2019t the type to put a logo or a pattern on something,\u201d she says. No: She was going to shape her slip-ons into something distinctly, tangibly, Toogood.", "That\u2019s a tricky endeavor, by the way. Birkenstocks are beloved precisely because of their configuration: their squishy, flat footbed, their loose fitting straps, their easy, throw on demeanor. (Can you name another shoe brand that\u2019s worn by Katie Holmes, models on the Valentino runway, and your grandpa?) \u201cYou have to be careful if you\u2019re talking about recutting them. That\u2019s like redoing the shape of a wheel,\u201d says Toogood. \u201cYou have to keep that fine line. We wanted to make something different, but something you could still connect to the original, practical, shape.\u201d", "The result? Three distinct designs that are still very embedded with the Birkenstock DNA, available later this month on 1774.com, t-o-o-g-o-o-d.com, and Matchesfashion.com.", "Toogood covered in Birkenstock x Toogood designs. Photo: By Tom Johnson", "First, there\u2019s the Forager, a simplistic style that comes in felt, leather and\u2014most ambitiously\u2014canvas. (Canvas is a signature fabric of Toogood\u2019s, used recently for her Puffy chair. She loves it for the challenge. \u201cAs a designer, you really have to work on the geometry to make it elevated and beautiful,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf it looks good in canvas, it means it's a great design.\u201d) Then, the Mudlark, a shoe Toogood imagines would be worn by an archaeologist mucking around for ancient artifacts by the river. Finally, the Beachcomber, a plump design inspired by frothy and fluffy seafoam.", "Overall, Toogood\u2019s color palette is a muted one. (See: that aforementioned focus on form.) With one exception: pollen, a hue that is best described as that of a dividing road line. Because, well, it actually is the same shade of a dividing road line: a few years ago, they were doing construction work on the street right out of Toogood\u2019s studio. Then it dawned on her: \u201cIt was the perfect utility yellow,\u201d she says. So she ran out and asked the workers to coat one of her sculptures. She\u2019s used that as a baseline ever since.", "Shoes aren\u2019t the only thing in her Birkenstock collaboration, by the way. Toogood was also inspired to make her own relaxed clothing line to pair with the no-fuss shoes, as well as a Birkenstock bed. (Yes, you read that right\u2014if it\u2019s your dream to have a bed with the same comfy consistency as a Birkenstock sole, put in a custom order on 1774.com.)", "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most ambitious project we\u2019ve done,\u201d says Toogood. \u201cBut it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d", "Below, peruse a few select pieces from Birkenstock x Toogood in advance.", "The Beachcomber in Flint Nappa $510 MATCHES FASHION Shop Now", "The Beachcomber in Chalk Nappa $510 MATCHES FASHION Shop Now"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["shoe", "collaborate", "shape", "faye", "birkenstock", "x", "toogoods", "line", "puffy", "toogood", "work", "way", "beachcomber", "practical"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
