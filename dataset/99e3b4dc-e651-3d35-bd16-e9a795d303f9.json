In one story, Nicol\u00e1s nags his older brother, Javi, to let him sell drugs with him and his dealer friend, Rick. The narrator\u2019s sense of illicit excitement at being among the big boys is heightened by a sexually charged moment as he and Rick count the takings. Then comes an abrupt section break: Rick has been shot dead and we\u2019re at the wake. In front of the casket, Javi snatches Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s hand: \u201cHe made me touch Rick\u2019s face. He told me this was what happened to fags.\u201d", "If Lot could resort to shock to get out of a tight spot (the above story takes place in just six pages), Washington\u2019s first novel, Memorial, is a more grownup proposition. Again set in Houston, it follows Benson, a black daycare worker, and Mike, a Japanese-born cook, who have been together for four years. When Mike learns that his long-estranged father is dying in Osaka, he decides to fly out \u2013 just as his mother, Mitsuko, turns up out of the blue in Texas.", "Having to host Mitsuko alone in a one-bed flat, never previously having met her, adds strain to Benson\u2019s already rocky relationship with Mike. Just when he\u2019d plucked up the courage to ask about having kids, Mike floated the idea of an open relationship and the memory of the hard words that followed colours the odd-couple predicament that occupies the novel\u2019s first third, with Mitsuko just as uneasy as Benson. When she asks how he feels about her staying, and he says it\u2019s fine, she says: \u201cI\u2019m fluent in fine. Fine means fucked.\u201d", "While Memorial shares Lot\u2019s attractively conversational style (not to mention its conspicuous indifference to \u201cwhiteboys\u201d and \u201cwhitegirls\u201d), Benson\u2019s segments, in particular, threaten to drown the book in self-pity. If some companionably awkward sex scenes provide relief \u2013 as well as vital context \u2013 it also helps that Washington is too savvy a writer not to see that his theme of communication failure can be funny as well as sad. Here\u2019s Benson seeking word from Osaka:", "", "\u201cI start to text Mike.", "I type, We\u2019re done.", "I type, Fuck you.", "I type, It\u2019s over dickhead.", "I type, How r u, and that\u2019s what I send.\u201d", "", "At times, the novel seems less a portrait of a relationship than a splice of two stories on the same theme: while Mike looks after his father, a bar-owning ex-alcoholic, Benson has to deal with his own estranged dad, a former meteorologist fired for on-air drunkenness. The ambling dual narrative, looping between past and present, draws tragicomic power from blunt coincidence: Mike breaks his radio silence at exactly the moment that Benson finds himself kissing another man.", "", "When Benson tells us he lives in \u201cthe Third Ward, a historically black part of Houston\u201d, it\u2019s hard not to feel a pang for the sink-or-swim immersion of Lot, whose streetwise voice had no truck with such reader-friendly niceties. Still, Lot took easy options in other ways and the more mature messiness of Memorial lies partly in Washington\u2019s calculated uncertainty over what resolution ought to look like in a gay love story, as Benson and Mike search for answers to questions they don\u2019t quite know how to ask. At one point, Benson tells his colleague Ximena that her fiance is \u201ca good dude, but what if it doesn\u2019t work out?\u201d \u201cNobody ever knows if it\u2019ll work,\u201d she says, in a line that might be Memorial\u2019s credo: \u201cThat\u2019s why you do this shit.
