honor and pleasure to be here.", "Um- my name is Dawn Song, um.", "I'm a professor at UC Berkeley in computer science", "and also the founder and CEO", "of a startup called Oasis Labs.", "[stammers]", "Let's wait a second for the slides to show up.", "Great!", "And today I'll be talking about the", "future of data privacy.", "So as we all know, data is a new oil", "of our modern economy.", "However, today, how the data is being utilized", "and handled, unfortunately, is creating huge issues", "for both businesses and individuals.", "So for businesses, uh, they have, they're facing", "a number of challenges when handling this data.", "First, data breaches continue to plague businesses.", "We have seen many large scale data breaches.", "Where attackers have stolen records of hundreds of millions", "or even billions of users in a single incident.", "And also, with the increasing privacy regulations,", "such as GDPR and CCPA it's becoming", "increasingly expensive for businesses to comply", "with this this regulations.", "And many of the business are not even equipped to do so.", "And also, at the same time, it's actually very difficult", "for businesses to utilize valuable data.", "A lot of valuable data is being siloed.", "It's being locked up and it's difficult", "for businesses to use.", "And when we look at, uh, individuals,", "individuals are also suffering.", "Individuals are losing control of their data", "and they are losing trust of companies that use their data", "and also, individuals are not really getting", "sufficient benefits for their data.", "So today, traditional solutions are insufficient", "to address these challenges.", "We need new, uh, technologies solutions.", "With these new technologies to provide", "better data protection, uh, not just for data", "at rest or in transit, but also for data in use.", "And also we need to enable controlled use of data", "instead of just traditionally copying", "and sharing the raw data.", "And also, we need to have more principle solutions", "to protect the computation output", "from leaking sensitive information.", "Instead of the traditional solutions of anonymizing data,", "which does not provide sufficient", "protection for data privacy.", "We are developing new technologies to establish a new", "data privacy paradigm for the benefits", "of both businesses and individuals.", "In particular, we are leveraging a number", "of new technical advancements.", "First, secure computing utilizing, for example", "hardware secure enclaves provides a practical", "and secure way to protect the computation process", "uh, from leaking sensitive information.", "And the concepts, such as differential privacy,", "provides a theoretical foundation for ensuring", "the computation output from leaking sensitive information.", "And technologies like distributed ledger", "and smart contract platforms provide immutable logs", "of the actions that have been taken on data,", "how the data's been utilized, who is being utilized", "and hence to ensure the data usage, uh,", "compliance with the desired policies.", "With a platform combining these technologies", "we can provide new solutions that provide better benefits", "for both businesses and individuals.", "So for businesses, it can provide better solutions", "to protect against malicious attacks and data breaches,", "and also can help ensure data usage", "is compliant with regulations.", "And also helps break down data silos", "to allow businesses to better utilize valuable data.", "And for individual users, this technology can help-", "and this new paradigm can help users", "to maintain control of their data.", "To maintain control of how their data is being utilized.", "And also to enable them to better", "participate in the data economy", "and seeking fairer compensation for their data.", "At Oasis Labs we are building the platform", "to make this new data privacy paradigm a reality.", "Our technology is being piloted at Stanford Hospital", "in collaboration with doctors there", "to help patients contribute their medical data", "for medical research in a privacy preserving way.", "And we are also working with genomic testing companies", "to help users to maintain control of their genomic data", "so that their genomic data can be used", "in a privacy preserving way while they still", "benefit from the analytical results.", "Privacy is not just about technology.", "More importantly it's our fundamental rights.", "So the concept of individual property rights,", "actually, has only been established in the recent past.", "In the last few hundred years.", "And, the establishment and the enforcement", "of individual property rights is now the cornerstone", "of modern economics and has been, uh,", "one of the main driving forces in propelling,", "uh, the modern economy.", "Similarly, when you consider data property rights as well.", "So today, we lack an adequate framework", "for data property rights.", "With the establishment, and enforcement, of data property", "rights this will help individuals to derive value from their", "data and also to propel economic growth to unlock new value.", "With this new paradigm we will be in a very different world", "where, uh, it allows users for the first time", "to become owners of their data instead of serfs.", "Thank you.", "So with that, I will talk more about data privacy", "and the new paradigm with Tom Simonite from Wired.", "Thank you Dawn.", "Lots of interesting ideas there.", "Um, I wanted to start with picking up", "what you talked about at the end there about property rights", "So, when people talk about the value of digital technology", "I think there's often, uh,", "an idea that the value comes from the freedom,", "uh, that you have.", "You don't have to worry about where", "something is physically located.", "You can do whatever you want with those", "and copy it over and over again and move it anywhere.", "What you're saying is that we actually need some limitations", "sometimes to- to do useful and valuable things.", "Yeah, we need to establish the, uh,", "the rise in ownership to data.", "And once value is derived from data", "we can populate, essentially distribute, the value", "that's being created from that data.", "Why do you think that we haven't", "managed to do this previously?", "Was it that people and companies building technology", "um, were chasing business models where it was convenient", "not to allow ownership?", "Or was it that there were technical challenges", "that prevented us from doing this before?", "Uh, that's a very good question.", "I think it's a number of factors.", "So one, without- uh- the actual um", "you know, notion of data ownership", "and data property rights.", "And without establishments enforcement of these rights", "then... say for example, any one, a business", "they can just take this data,", "and then they can derive value from it,", "and without attributing value properly", "back to the original data owners,", "and also throughout the process of the data pipeline.", "Okay", "[Dawn] And also, um so far, we also have now", "been having sufficient technical solutions", "to enable this process as well.", "[Tom] Okay, and you briefly mentioned a few", "technologies that you are using to do this new thing.", "One of them you described as um distributed ledges.", "Other people use the B word.", "Any children in the room should cover their ears.", "Block chain.", "Um, it's a word that has become a little bit", "of a punchline in some ways.", "You know, here at Wired, we've covered digital heists,", "uh, federal indictments, frauds, block chain conference", "where the catering was spiked with THC.", "Um, you talk about block chain differently.", "What is valuable about this technology?", "You know, as a computer scientist what do you see", "in this approach that is unique?", "Mmhmm.", "Yeah, block chain distribulator is a technology", "that essentially enables, um uh, essentially,", "for example, establishing records without", "relying on central trust.", "Uh, so in the past, for example, if want to", "identify the ownership of properties,", "for example even Tai Ho properties and so on,", "for example you'll have to rely on", "someone keeping track of this database.", "And you need to essentially rely on the trust", "that this data base is being kept in a secure way.", "Uh, now for example, the entity is not going to modify it", "without actually, uh you know, the consent of the right", "person, and so on.", "So there's a lot of central trust, in this case,", "that's being put.", "Maintaining the correct records for this database.", "And this causes a number of issues.", "One is that it really relies on the", "central trust of the entity and it can be very inefficient.", "Um, and it also doesn't provide, really,", "the sufficient security for that.", "So, with the distribulator technology, essentially,", "in a fully decentralized world you actually can have,", "essentially, a group of entities that come together", "even if they don't actually trust each other mutually,", "but the distribulator and block chain technology can", "enable this group together to maintain", "this ledger, this database,", "without actually relying on the trust of any of them.", "And in this case even if some fraction of this group", "is malicious the record is still being kept in a secure way.", "And this way, essentially, it helps remove the trust,", "an essential party, and can help remove a lot", "of intermediaries in a process", "where this information is being utilized.", "[Tom] Okay.", "And so, using that technology and some other tricks", "and inventions from your group, you are, uh,", "running a trial you mentioned with the Stanford Group.", "Tell us about what, how that works", "from the patient side of things.", "So, um, there's a service, you called it Kara I think.", "[Dawn] Right, right.", "Where people can volunteer their data.", "How does that work?", "What can people do?", "[Dawn] Oh yeah, so, the patient with the app", "actually can take a photo of their medical records", "and also for example in this case", "for ophthalmology, can take a photo of their scans", "and uh our technology then will help enable patients", "to contribute this data in a privacy preserving way.", "And enable the data to be utilized for", "for example, for medical research and so on,", "in a privacy preserving way.", "And in the future patients could also get benefits from that", "[Tom] Okay, and that could include being", "paid for the data, you think?", "[Dawn] Right. Yeah.", "Are we all gonna get rich from our medical data?", "Do you have a sense from of how much, ya know,", "an ophthalmology image might be, or?", "So that's a very good question,", "Um, so, uh, so I think that's important for users", "in the interest of our patients, to maintain control", "of their data and this allows them actually to", "gain a number of different benefits", "while having their privacy being protected.", "One, of course, on top of monetary benefits...", "So for example if a patient has some rare disease", "and their data can be hugely valuable in developing", "new drugs and new cures for other disease.", "Um, and also, what we have seen, for example", "in our collaboration with genomic testing companies", "that in this case actually helps users to get", "uh, can help users get better services", "and get different analysis and results", "while still owning their data", "and uh, with their data being, uh um", "data privacy being protected.", "So essentially, in the future, this actually can help enable", "them to benefit from more services", "at the same time to still maintain their privacy.", "And hence, I think, it's even, like, greater value", "than just getting money to you.", "Okay, and in a lot of these projects", "I imagine, in the medical projects for example,", "they probably want to collect as much data as possible", "from many many different people.", "How do you figure out the individual", "contribution of each data point?", "Yeah that's a very good question.", "There's some new research that we have", "been working on as well.", "So when you look at essentially how to value", "the contribution of different individuals", "or different data sources.", "So far today there is no good solution.", "There is like a very ad hoc solutions.", "Maybe people just try to negotiate how much", "to get paid for their data.", "Maybe an auction for their data.", "But we're having, doing new research", "looking at how we can provide some more", "principle solutions to value the data.", "In particular, to value how you distribute value", "among the different data sources.", "So, in this case, essentially um, we think there are a", "few important considerations for", "any data valuation mechanisms to take into account.", "So, one, it actually needs to be task specific.", "So essentially, for example, if Alice has a,", "has a disease.", "And her data is particularly useful for training", "a machining model for curing this disease,", "but not for other diseases.", "And hence her data is particularly valuable", "for this particular task.", "For coming up with drugs or cures", "for this particular disease.", "And also, it should be fair so that", "if someone's data is particularly useful for training", "this particular machining model.", "For example, the data point is a more rare point", "that's very, particularly useful for training", "this machine model then this data point,", "or this data source,", "should be considered to have,", "it should attribute higher value to that.", "And also, we need to have a very efficient way to compute", "uh, this data value attribution.", "So we have been developing new techniques in this space.", "And this problem, actually, is very interesting.", "A similar problem has been well studied", "in the field of cooperative game theory.", "So essentially, it's about if you have a number of parties", "coming together in a collective effort", "and this collective effort gains profits", "Uh, then how you should distribute profits among this group.", "And there's a notion called the Shapley Value,", "that is utilized to essentially do this task.", "And uh, we have been developing new techniques showing that", "this Shapley Value one, is actually a very good concept.", "When we try to figure out data valuation", "for different data sources,", "for contributing to, for example a machining model.", "And also we have been developing very efficient techniques.", "How to compute the Shapley Value even, ya know,", "for a very large scale machining.", "[Tom] Okay. And then, just briefly,", "cause we're running out of time,", "Um, you'll talk about applications", "where there isn't much data moving around today,", "medical data is hard to get ahold of for researchers.", "There are many parts of the economy where people,", "you know, uh, the cat is out of the bag.", "And when I say cat, I mean our data.", "You know, we've given it away, it's gone.", "Do you think that this approach can compete with", "those businesses that already,", "that operate in a less secure or private manner?", "Exactly, exactly.", "That's very good question.", "So essentially, that's why we view this as a new", "data privacy paradigm.", "So in this paradigm, essentially, data gets", "When you share the data, essentially,", "you share the raw data and then once you give data to", "someone you completely lose control of the data.", "You don't know what happens to it, uh, who uses it,", "how it's.. what it's used for.", "In this new data privacy paradigm", "we call it a controlled data use.", "You don't really just give out copies of the raw data.", "So someone who wants to use the data and", "benefit from the data essentially", "will need to do this in this controlled fashion", "so that even someone try to use the data", "it will still be enforced to use the data", "in a privacy preserving way.", "[Tom] Okay.
