Biden has repeatedly denied the claims.", "A video tweeted out by the Sanders campaign hours before Tuesday\u2019s primetime Democratic presidential primary debate in Iowa included a clip of Sanders from a recent CNN interview saying: \u201cJoe Biden has been on the floor of the Senate talking about the need to cut Social Security.\u201d It then showed an old C-SPAN clip of Biden on the Senate floor saying, \u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security, as well.\u201d", "THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE", "Campaigning in Iowa on Saturday, Biden pushed back, as he pointed to another video from an unverified account that was re-tweeted by the Sanders campaign. That video was deceptively edited to appear to show Biden agreeing with Ryan.", "Biden told an audience that \u201cBernie\u2019s people\u201d had circulated a video that falsely suggested that in 2018 he agreed with then-House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s push to dismantle Social Secuirty benefits.", "\u201cIt\u2019s simply a lie, that video that\u2019s going around,\" he said. \"This is a doctored tape. And I think it\u2019s beneath, and I\u2019m looking for his campaign to disown it but they haven\u2019t yet.\u201d", "Sanders\u2019s campaign manager Faiz Shakir responded hours later, charging in a statement that \u201cJoe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.\u201d", "\u201cThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security -- he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions,\u201d Shakir added. \u201cThe vice president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\u201d", "Sanders didn\u2019t mention his dispute with Biden over Social Security at campaign events in New Hampshire on Friday. But he did turn up the volume on his pitch for women voters in the first-in-the-nation primary state.", "Sanders\u2019 comments at the Portsmouth Women\u2019s March and at a town hall event in Exeter came four days after the populist senator clashed on-stage at Tuesday\u2019s debate in Iowa with fellow progressive and 2020 nomination rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over sexism and whether or not he told her a woman couldn\u2019t win the presidency.", "SANDERS-WARREN SEXISM CLASH PAYS OFF FOR BOTH CAMPAIGNS", "\u201cWe are in this together,\u201d Sanders said in a short speech ahead of the march in Portsmouth.", "\u201cMen, if you think abortion rights, if you think equal pay for equal work is just a women\u2019s issue, you are dead wrong,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is a human issue and the men have got to stand with the women.\u201d", "Sanders didn\u2019t take part in the actual march in Portsmouth. Instead, he headed to Exeter, where he pledged to more than 1,000 people gathered at the high school \u201cthat I will never nominate any individual to the Supreme Court or any other federal courts who is not 100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade.\u201d", "On Friday, the Sanders campaign went up with two new TV commercials in New Hampshire. In one of the ads, the senator highlights his commitment to women\u2019s rights, warning that under Republican President Trump, \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are under attack.\u201d", "Sanders\u2019 appearance at the rally in Portsmouth was a late addition to his schedule. Reporters weren\u2019t notified until Friday night. The campaign told Seacoast Online that the organizers of the event had invited the senator -- but not everybody appeared happy with his appearance.", "Portsmouth Democrats Chair Laurie McCray told Fox News that \u201cthe Women\u2019s Marches, in my opinion, should be for, by and a about women and the issues that are important to them.

The meeting took place as both lawmakers were each gearing up to launch White House bids.", "\u201cWell, as a matter of fact I didn\u2019t say it,\" Sanders insisted at the debate, as he unequivocally denied that the conversation took place.", "Warren said she disagreed with the notion that a woman candidate couldn\u2019t defeat President Trump in November\u2019s general election.", "\"Bernie is my friend and I\u2019m not here to try to fight with Bernie,\u201d she also explained, before saying it was important to take the issue of sexism \"head-on.\"", "But at the end of the debate, Warren refused to shake Sanders\u2019 hand as the two senators had a brief, heated conversation in which both candidates called each other a liar. Since the salvos on the debate stage, both candidates have refused to discuss the showdown, and Sanders didn\u2019t bring it up at his Portsmouth or Exeter stops.", "The fireworks smashed the non-aggression pact between the two. And the clash brings gender back into the spotlight and opens up Sanders to allegations of sexism. This, after the independent senator earlier this cycle survived a controversy over claims of sexual harassment by some of his male staffers on his 2016 presidential campaign.", "Fox News' Madeleine Rivera and Rob DiRienza contributed to this report."], "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "keywords": ["womens", "told", "video", "debate", "trade", "security", "biden", "social", "sanders", "campaign", "president"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
