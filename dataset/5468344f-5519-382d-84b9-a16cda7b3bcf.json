(Images from the series will be on view at the Museum of Art and History in Lancaster, California from February 8 to April 19.) Although Johnson has kept the methods behind the images a secret, the upshot is that by modifying how the German camera operated he was able to sharply render objects in motion while turning their backgrounds into colorful streaks.", "The eureka moment, he said, came when he realized that panoramic cameras actually produce timeline images. When you take a panorama photograph on your smartphone, for instance, you aren\u2019t capturing a single moment in time\u2014you\u2019re capturing a given landscape over the course of the 30 seconds or so that it takes to pan your camera across the horizon. By tinkering with the camera\u2019s settings, Johnson was able to capture an entire narrative in a single frame. \u201cI approached my subjects like a cinematographer,\u201d he explains.", "Johnson sought out subjects for the series all over the world, from an open-pit coal mine in Kentucky to a commuter train in Johannesburg, South Africa. Some of the earliest images in the series show a woman performing tai chi at a photography studio in Hamburg, Germany. \u201cPeople doing tai chi move very slowly for long periods of time,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cSo I could stand next to someone and just keep shooting all kinds of angles, trying out different lenses and recording speeds.\u201d", "A genuine Renaissance man, Johnson trained as an architect before moving into performance art, political activism, filmmaking, special effects work, and now fine-art photography. In the 1990s he spent two years studying linguistics and biological anthropology at UCLA. What connects all these disparate endeavors is Johnson\u2019s polymorphous curiosity about the world. In explaining the Spacetime series, he made reference to theoretical physics, Japanese poetry, the philosophical field of epistemology, director Ridley Scott, and Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico.", "\u201cFor something to capture my interest it has to be challenging or curious or stand out in some way,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThe same holds true whether I\u2019m looking at art or making it.\u201d", "Johnson is the first to admit that the Spacetime photographs can be hard to decipher\u2014\u201cthe human brain isn\u2019t equipped to process them\u201d\u2014but for him, that\u2019s exactly the point. He wants to force viewers to reconsider their categories of perception. \u201cIn my view, space and time are just cultural constructs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re blended together, and we separate them conceptually.\u201d", "To quote from one of the films Johnson worked on: Whoa.", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Michael Hardy", "Michael Hard", "Flavie Halais", "John Pavlus", "Sophia Chen"], "keywords": ["worked", "johnson", "photos", "camera", "spacetime", "capturing", "space", "series", "photography", "literally", "images", "art", "bend", "world"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
