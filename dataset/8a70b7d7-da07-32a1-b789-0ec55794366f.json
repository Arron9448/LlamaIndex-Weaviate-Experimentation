Meanwhile, Nintendo fans have had to wait patiently for their time to shine. Thankfully, that time is close at hand. Monster Hunter Rise is an all-new adventure for Nintendo Switch, giving hunters another excuse to hit the field (and a host of monsters). In this episode of NGT, we take a look at what\u2019s ahead, including a look at the returning fan favorite (?), the Khezu.", "We start out with a quick look at Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s cooking system. Unlike World\u2019s kitchen, which featured drool-worthy entrees and dishes, Rise seems to be more about indulging your hunter\u2019s sweet tooth.

Story be damned; Monster Hunter vets know that the only reason hunters hunt is to fill their closets with spiffy new gear. If you\u2019re curious to learn what Rise\u2019s take on Khezu gear looks like, it\u2019s your lucky day! We show off the complete set, from the Assassin\u2019s Creed-style outfit to a grotesque, toothy hammer.", "Monster Hunter Rise is coming to Nintendo Switch on March 26."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["nintendo", "look", "theyre", "hunter", "fight", "switch", "today", "boss", "monster", "hunters", "rises", "returning", "gameplay", "rise", "khezu"], "pubDate": "2021-02-26T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
