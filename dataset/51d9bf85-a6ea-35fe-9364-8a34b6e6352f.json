Legal challenges chipped away at some of the restrictions, but travel bans on citizens from more than a dozen mostly-Muslim majority countries survived \u2013 until they were scrapped by President Joe Biden in one of his first acts in office.", "It was the end of a cruel regime of policies that did nothing to make Americans safer, according to national security experts. Instead, it cut US citizens off from their friends and families, upended educations and careers, and tarnished the reputation of a country that, despite its misadventures in the Islamic world, was still a magnet for ambitious and successful Muslim migrants.", "Many are now preparing to apply for visas again, hoping Biden\u2019s election will turn the page on a dark era of American history. Some are still wary, wondering if the xenophobia that birthed the Muslim ban will linger long after the order has been scrapped.", "Of the estimated 42,000 people whose visa applications were turned down as a result of the ban, most were Iranians. Elkhlasi, 30, was born in Tehran but became an American citizen only months before Trump was elected. It felt as if the country to which she had sworn allegiance had turned on her, she says.", "\u201cI became a US citizen to defend the US and to do whatever it took to count this as my country,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this country was not allowing my parents to even come and visit me, to see my new house. I was heartbroken.\u201d", "Three weeks before the first ban came into place, Shawki Ahmed\u2019s wife and three children had interviewed for their US citizenship applications at the American embassy in Cairo. The second-generation Yemeni American, a member of the NYPD, had been trying to get his family to the country since the eruption of Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2014.", "The Trump order threw the process into chaos, he says. \u201cIt took two and a half years to sort out: legal fees, I wrote the embassy, used lawyers \u2013 nothing.\u201d", "It became clear the hurdle was not a matter of documents or security tests \u2013 it was simply who they were.", "\u201cI\u2019m a police officer, my father came to this country in 1959, we are law-abiding tax-paying citizens, we\u2019re not dependent on welfare,\u201d Ahmed, 40, says. \u201cBut apparently Trump decided those things don\u2019t matter just because of our last name \u2013 because we are Muslim.\u201d", "In Gaziantep, Syrian national Aya Shayah had more riding on the US presidential election than most. Her son, Hisham, requires surgery on his ear that a specialist in Los Angeles can complete six months faster than doctors in Turkey. She had visited her sister in the US a few times since 2013. Visiting Myrtle Beach in South Carolina was \u201clike a movie\u201d, the Syrian national recalls. \u201cPeople running, and kites in the sky, and dog walking, it was so nice to see that.\u201d", "Aya Shayah applied for a US visa in 2016 so her son Hisham could have ear surgery performed in Los Angeles. Photograph: Courtesy Aya Shayah", "She filled out an application to renew her visa in 2016, just before Trump won office. \u201cIt was a very long application, they literally wanted every detail of my life from about age five,\u201d Shayah says. \u201cAnd after all that, there was a six-month silence, and then they rejected me.\u201d", "With Syrians now allowed to visit, and her sister pregnant again, she will try to return. \u201cNow Trump is gone, I am applying for us again and I hope we will get it, I am feeling positive about it,\u201d Shayah says.", "Elkhlasi followed the presidential race from London, where she moved after two years of lobbying to allow her parents to enter the US, efforts that she says left her questioning if she could ever really be American. \u201cThe ban felt very personal,\u201d she says. \u201cIt got me mad, I was in a depression phase. I wondered, \u2018Are Americans always going to think of me differently?\u2019\u201d", "It was the reaction of her colleagues and friends in California to the Muslim ban that gave her faith, she says. \u201cThey said they were sorry, that they didn\u2019t know how to apologise \u2013 even though it wasn\u2019t their fault. But it made me feel better. It changed my feelings about America, and that\u2019s the only reason I want to give it another try.\u201d", "Ahmed\u2019s family was stranded abroad for almost three years. \u201cIt was very costly emotionally,\u201d he says. \u201cMy kids were out of school for close to a year, it was very hard on them; they wanted to know what they had done wrong to be cut off from home and their dad. My mother was sick in Cairo and I couldn\u2019t bring her to America for treatment.\u201d", "In October 2019, he finally managed to get them to the US, but knows that tens of thousands of others in similar situations had no such luck. \u201cPeople in the community are definitely joyful that Trump has gone and the ban has been lifted,\u201d he says. \u201cWe feel like democracy has been restored. This is the America my father came to: immigrant America is the real America.\u201d"], "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Bethan Mckernan"], "keywords": ["shayah", "security", "country", "trump", "scraps", "view", "visa", "order", "caution", "america", "hope", "migrants", "biden", "american", "ban", "muslim"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
