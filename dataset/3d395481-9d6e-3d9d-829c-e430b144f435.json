{"paragraphs": ["TODAY, in the courtyard of the Greenwich Hotel, Gerwig is dressed not unlike Alcott, or Jo March, in a high-necked, long-sleeved indigo APC blouse with small blue buttons down the front. She can be deliberate and considered\u2014speaking with measured ellipses, holding her chin in her hand, Winnie-the-Pooh-style when thinking\u2014but then erupt with the energy of a 1940s screwball-comedy heroine. \u201cI mean, goodness, you\u2019re getting completely unfiltered just me sifting through what we did,\u201d she exclaims at one point. Like the characters in her early films, Gerwig seems to be letting you in on the way her mind works in real time. She will later admit that speaking about Little Women with unbridled ardor for two hours left her exhausted. Gerwig appears to do everything this way: with full thrust, with her entire gravitational force behind her. This was certainly true of making Little Women.", "\u201cIt\u2019s epic personal filmmaking,\u201d says Meryl Streep, who plays \u201cthe old battle-ax\u201d Aunt March. \u201cIt\u2019s very much the author\u2019s tale, and as a result it\u2019s hers,\u201d she says. The film, which begins with the sisters as adults, unfolds in two time lines, mirrored in the two halves of the book, which were originally published by Alcott as separate volumes. The first takes place when the girls are teenagers; the second, seven years later. And the ending, an invention of Gerwig\u2019s, introduces a meta--narrative comparing the paths of Jo and Alcott. \u201cI had the idea that if I could make Jo publishing a book at the end the thing you didn\u2019t know you needed to see,\u201d she says, \u201cit would be the way you want people to end up together in a movie.\u201d She places her hand over her heart and leans across the table. \u201cYou want her to get that book, and you don\u2019t realize it until you see it and she\u2019s holding it in her hands. You\u2019re like, That\u2019s the thing. That book.\u201d", "\u201cWhen I watched the first cut of Little Women,\u201d says Baumbach, \u201cI felt like you know exactly why this movie\u2019s being made, because it\u2019s so personal. It both serves the story and honors the book, and then is really something that only she could do.\u201d Painstakingly detailed, the film is traditional in look, but not staid. Gerwig kept her camera in constant, restless motion and quickened the pace of Alcott\u2019s dialogue: \u201cI wanted to hear all the lines traditionally, but said at the speed of life,\u201d she says. \u201cGreat things said with irreverence.\u201d For the waltz scenes, Gerwig brought in choreographer Monica Bill Barnes, who had the actors dance to The Cure and David Bowie. And Watson, a trained yoga instructor, led the group in yoga and meditation. \u201cHaving so many girls leading the way on set definitely changed the tone,\u201d says Ronan. \u201cWe were all completely hyper with each other, and Greta is such a girl\u2019s girl herself, she really captured that energy.\u201d", "When they wrapped, Gerwig was six months pregnant, but thanks to a wardrobe of A-line dresses and cocoon coats, the cast say, they had no idea. \u201cI just figured that was her style at the moment,\u201d says Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays Jo\u2019s neighbor Laurie. They\u2019d shot in Concord, Massachusetts\u2014Alcott\u2019s home\u2014with Gerwig going so far as to build an exact replica of Orchard House, where Alcott wrote (and set) Little Women. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place, all of these people living in proximity to each other and reimagining the world,\u201d Gerwig says of Concord. \u201cIt gets inside of you.\u201d She is referring to the cluster of American thinkers who congregated there more than a century ago, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Emerson lived across the street from the Alcotts and was the family\u2019s longtime benefactor. Thoreau is thought by some biographers to have been Alcott\u2019s inspiration for Laurie and would take the young Alcott sisters on nature walks around neighboring Walden Pond. During filming, Gerwig spent weekends doing the same. She also visited nearby Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, home to all of the authors\u2019 graves, where admirers leave pens at the headstones. At Alcott\u2019s, Gerwig left a yellow Lamy fountain pen."], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/greta-gerwig-cover-january-2020", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["women", "alcott", "girls", "motherhood", "youre", "book", "adventures", "gerwig", "greta", "way", "little", "alcotts", "jo", "twin", "filmmaking"], "id": "3d395481-9d6e-3d9d-829c-e430b144f435", "title": "Greta Gerwig on the Twin Adventures of Filmmaking and Motherhood", "summary": "She will later admit that speaking about Little Women with unbridled ardor for two hours left her exhausted.\nThis was certainly true of making Little Women.\nThat book.\u201d\u201cWhen I watched the first cut of Little Women,\u201d says Baumbach, \u201cI felt like you know exactly why this movie\u2019s being made, because it\u2019s so personal.\nThey\u2019d shot in Concord, Massachusetts\u2014Alcott\u2019s home\u2014with Gerwig going so far as to build an exact replica of Orchard House, where Alcott wrote (and set) Little Women.\nAt Alcott\u2019s, Gerwig left a yellow Lamy fountain pen.", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chloe Mall", "Annie Leibovit"]}
