The bad guys would need to know both to read your stuff.", "If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a public key that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient \u2013 and no one else \u2013 has a corresponding private key which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.", "Get started", "Don\u2019t use your regular email address. Create a new email account solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do it on a computer that isn\u2019t being monitored, and make sure the sign-up information you provide doesn\u2019t tie the account back to you.", "If you\u2019re using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or GMX webmail, look into Mailvelope for encrypting messages in your browser. Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, are Gpg4win for Windows and GPGSuite for Mac.", "Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys. Keep your private key and password safe and don\u2019t store the two together.", "After that", "You should encrypt your messages and attachments using both your public key and that of the person you are writing to. All being well, this means that only you and the journalist will be able to decrypt them. You can find Guardian journalists\u2019 keys at theguardian.com/pgp.", "Information carried with an email message can reveal your IP address. If you don\u2019t want the location you\u2019ll send from to be traceable, connect to your email service over the Tor network.", "Email your encrypted material to us, along with a copy of your public key so we can reply to you also under encryption. Don\u2019t encrypt the public key itself.", "Remember to log out after sending the message. You may also wish to delete the history of the correspondence from your browser or email software. Keep your computer secure."], "authors": ["Luke Hoyland", "Chris Fenn"], "keywords": ["securely", "pgp", "key", "message", "public", "encryption", "guardian", "person", "contact", "email", "keys", "messages"], "pubDate": "2017-03-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
