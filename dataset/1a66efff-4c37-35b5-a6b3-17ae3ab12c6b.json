Manolo Arroyo, the president of the company\u2019s Asia Pacific Group, was named to take on the marketing portion of Mr. Crespo\u2019s responsibilities under the resurrected title of CMO.", "Although most big companies employ CMOs, the title has become less popular in the past few years as marketing increasingly overlaps with other business drivers like innovation, analytics and strategy. CMO titles have been eliminated or gone unfilled this year at brands including Uber Technologies Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Beam Suntory Inc.", "About 70% of large companies have CMOs at the corporate level, down from roughly 74% in 2009, according to estimates by leadership advisory firm Spencer Stuart.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "When Coca-Cola named Mr. Crespo as chief growth officer and cut the CMO role, Chief Executive Officer James Quincey explained that marketing was becoming less neatly separated from other key activities.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a much greater intersection and integration of how to engage with consumers and shoppers,\u201d Mr. Quincey said on an earnings call then. \u201cAnd therefore, bringing together in one group the classical marketing pieces with a customer piece with a commercial piece and with the strategy, underpinned with the digital engagement, is what\u2019s going to allow us to more seamlessly operate in this new environment.\u201d", "Coca-Cola declined to make executives available on Monday to discuss the reversal, but pointed to a staff memo by Mr. Quincey about the changes.", "Though Mr. Crespo built a strong framework for growth around the company, the company needs more emphasis on marketing to accelerate its vision, Mr. Quincey said in the memo.", "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the trap of some of these proxy roles sometimes,\u201d said Keith Johnston, vice president and research director at Forrester Research Inc., which recently predicted that CMO titles would continue to wane. \u201cIf you\u2019ve aligned budgets and decisions, you\u2019re in a pretty good place, but you can\u2019t have someone who doesn\u2019t really understand marketing. You have to emphasize the customer relationship because that\u2019s how brands are built now, but you can\u2019t dismiss the fact that brand plays a role.\u201d", "Mr. Arroyo has more marketing experience than Mr. Crespo did when he became chief growth officer. Mr. Arroyo also will continue in his role as president of the Asia Pacific Group.", "\u201cIf the argument is you want them to focus more on marketing, I\u2019m not sure that giving them a business unit in addition to marketing is going to help them focus,\u201d said Kim Whitler, assistant professor at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business and a former CMO of David\u2019s Bridal Inc.", "The job titles that companies use don\u2019t always completely correspond to responsibilities, and can fluctuate over time without revealing much about larger industry trends, Ms. Whitler added. \u201cThere are no rules about what sets of responsibilities go with what title,\u201d she said.", "Even Coca-Cola\u2019s chief growth officer didn\u2019t oversee innovation, an important component of growth, Ms. Whitler said.", "A Coca-Cola spokesman said the company considers both growth and innovation to be high priorities, noting that both the chief growth officer and chief innovation officer report to Mr. Quincey.", "Coca-Cola\u2019s sales rose in the third quarter, largely due to variations on its namesake cola such as Coke Zero Sugar.
