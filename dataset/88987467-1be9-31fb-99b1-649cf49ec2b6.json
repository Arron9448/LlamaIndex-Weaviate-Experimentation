While there is no evidence the gunman in that spree targeted Asian-Americans, the fact that six of the victims were Asian Americans has triggered a rush to declare the shooting a hate crime.", "The article, by Times staff writer Ashley Lee, stemmed from a previous report on a local theater's award ceremony \"where organizers mispronounced the name of an Asian American nominee and displayed a photo of the wrong actor.\"", "Lee wrote she was \"disheartened\" by the emails the Times received that were quick to mock the report and dismiss it as \"Asian victimhood.\"", "CNN RAISES EYEBROWS AFTER WARNING OF 'RACIST' FONTS THAT 'COMMUNICATE ASIANNESS'", "\"The Ovation Awards\u2019 snafus \u2014 and some of our readers\u2019 reactions to the news coverage of them \u2014 are emblematic of the casual racism in the theater world and the world at large,\" Lee wrote. \"Mispronouncing someone\u2019s name, accidentally or on purpose, at the very least demonstrates a selective laziness to learn the correct way to address or acknowledge a person.

David Perdue during the 2020 election campaign, for which he received fierce backlash, calling it a \"name-based microaggression.\"", "\"It all echoes the pervasive invisibility of Asians in America, where your name isn\u2019t worth saying correctly, whether you\u2019re an actor in an Oscar-winning movie or a slain victim of senseless gun violence,\" Lee summarized.", "ANDREW SULLIVAN BLASTS MEDIA FOR 'GROTESQUELY' DISTORTING ATLANTA SHOOTINGS TO PUSH HATE CRIME 'NARRATIVE'", "The Times shared Lee's piece on Twitter, where it was mocked by critics.", "\"The silliness of the @LATimes,\" AEI resident scholar Christina Sommers reacted.", "\"People will likely mispronounce your name if they\u2019ve never seen it or heard it before.
