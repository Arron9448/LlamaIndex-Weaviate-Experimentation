Those signs sit in yards zoned for single families, in communities that organize against efforts to add the new homes that would bring those values closer to reality. Poorer families \u2014 disproportionately nonwhite and immigrant \u2014 are pushed into long commutes, overcrowded housing and homelessness. Those inequalities have turned deadly during the pandemic.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re living eight or 10 people to a home, it\u2019s hard to protect yourself from the virus,\u201d Senator Wiener told me. \u201cYet what we see at times is people with a Bernie Sanders sign and a \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 sign in their window, but they\u2019re opposing an affordable housing project or an apartment complex down the street.\u201d", "Once you start looking for this pattern, you see it everywhere. California talks a big game on climate change, but even with billions of dollars in federal funding, it couldn\u2019t build high-speed rail between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The project was choked by pricey consultants, private land negotiations, endless environmental reviews, county governments suing the state government. It has been shrunk to a line connecting the midsize cities of Bakersfield and Merced, and even that is horribly over budget and behind schedule.", "Smaller projects are also herculean lifts. In San Francisco, for example, it took 10 years to get two rapid bus transit lines through environmental review. It\u2019s become common in the state to see legislation like the California Environmental Quality Act wielded against projects that would curb sprawl. Groups with no record of green advocacy use it to force onerous environmental analyses that have been used to block everything from bike lanes to affordable housing developments to homeless shelters.", "The vaccine rollout in California was marred by overly complex eligibility criteria that slowed the pace of vaccinations terribly in the early days. Those regulations were written with good intentions, as California politicians worried over how to balance speed and equity. The result, however, wasn\u2019t fairness, but sluggishness, and California lagged behind the rest of the nation for the first weeks of the effort. Eventually, the state reversed course and simplified eligibility.", "Some conservative outcomes are intended; California\u2019s voters blocked the 2020 ballot initiative restoring affirmative action on purpose. But some reflect old processes and laws that interest groups or existing communities have perverted for their own ends. The California Environmental Quality Act wasn\u2019t passed to stop mass transit \u2014 a fact California finally acknowledged when it recently passed legislation carving out exemptions. The profusion of councils and public hearings that let NIMBYs block new homes are a legacy of a progressivism that wanted to stop big developers from slicing communities up with highways, not help wealthy homeowners fight affordable apartments. California wants to be the future, but its governing institutions are stuck in the past. Its structures of decision making too often privilege incumbents who like things the way they are over those who need them to change.", "Writing this piece, I found myself thinking about Ibram X. Kendi\u2019s book \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist.\u201d Kendi\u2019s central argument is that it is policy outcomes, not personal intent, that matter. \u201cRacist policies are defined as any policy that leads to racial inequity,\u201d he told me when I interviewed him in 2019. \u201cAnd so, for me, racial language in the policy doesn\u2019t matter, intent of the policymaker doesn\u2019t matter, even the consciousness of the policymaker, that it\u2019s going lead to inequity, doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about the fundamental outcome.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ezra Klein"], "keywords": ["housing", "squirm", "environmental", "stop", "making", "francisco", "san", "policy", "opinion", "matter", "state", "sign", "liberals", "california"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
