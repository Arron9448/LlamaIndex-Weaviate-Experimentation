Some of his favorites include Star Wars, The Edge of Tomorrow, and Roger Zelazny\u2019s Amber series.", "\u201cIt really sets you free, when anything goes,\u201d Altucher says in Episode 461 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cWhen there\u2019s time travel, when there\u2019s teleportation, when there\u2019s galactic empires with mystical powers. When there\u2019s a universe where there\u2019s a planet where it\u2019s perfect order, and there\u2019s another universe where it\u2019s perfect chaos, and there\u2019s a spectrum of infinite universes in between, and you can go in and out of those universes. It was just beautiful to me.\u201d", "Altucher\u2019s love of Star Wars was so intense that \u201cuse the Force\u201d practically became his religion. \u201cI remember one time I was going out of business with one of my businesses\u2014things were going bad, investors were pulling out of the business\u2014and I would buy these weird self-published books on \u2018How to Use the Force,'\u201d he says. \u201cI was an adult in my 30s, and I would literally say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to trust in the Force that this business is going to be saved.\u2019 It was saved\u2014probably not because of the Force\u2014but that\u2019s how much that movie, and the movies that came after it in the Star Wars family, had an effect on me.\u201d", "In his new book Skip the Line, Altucher relates lessons about life and business that he\u2019s learned throughout his career. One of his biggest successes came from writing computer software to model the behavior of the stock market, an idea he got from Isaac Asimov\u2019s Foundation series. \u201cWhen I would pitch my strategy\u2014because a big part of running a hedge fund is raising money, and you have to pitch your strategy\u2014I would always ask people if they had read the Foundation series, because I would use that to explain my strategy,\u201d he says.", "Altucher has dreams of becoming a science fiction author himself, and back in 2015 he planned to spend the year writing science fiction, before being sidetracked by a career in stand-up comedy. But now he\u2019s planning to return to the field, with the aid of podcast guests such as Chuck Wendig, Andy Weir, and Hugh Howey.", "\u201cI only have someone on my podcast when they\u2019re doing something I want to do,\u201d he says. \u201cA podcast is a great excuse to call someone up. It\u2019s a great excuse to call up Neil Gaiman and say, \u2018Hey, can you come on my podcast? I\u2019ll help you promote your latest book.\u2019 But really what I want to do is learn how to create Sandman.\u201d", "Listen to the complete interview with James Altucher in Episode 461 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.", "James Altucher on Star Wars:", "\u201cDepending on what generation you were born into, some people like the prequels, some people like the sequels, some people hate those. I like all of them, except for maybe the very last one. [The Rise of Skywalker] I thought was horrible. \u2026 It was a big mess, just to kind of tie everything up.\u201d", "James Altucher on time travel:", "\u201cGroundhog Day is an amazing movie. I think they theorize that he\u2019s in the Groundhog Day 19,000 days in a row, give or take. He learns to play the piano like a master\u2014he learns so many skills\u2014and he becomes a better person as a result. In all of these science fiction movies, part of the point is that it doesn\u2019t happen to someone special. It happens to someone mediocre, or even below mediocre, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. We can relate to that person who\u2019s mediocre, who\u2019s an everyday person, and we can speculate: \u2018What would it mean for me?\u2019 Watching Groundhog Day is almost like a safe way to experience those 19,000 days, and understand how I would learn, and how I would grow, and maybe I can learn those things now without spending those 19,000 days.\u201d", "James Altucher on artificial intelligence:", "\u201cAI is a different beast, computers are not humans. A computer processor does not act in any way like a brain. There\u2019s nothing about computers that would make me think suddenly one\u2019s going to become conscious. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s at least a thousand years away. \u2026 The only reason people say, \u2018Oh, one day AI will wake up,\u2019 is because it was a branding thing in the \u201980s. The Department of Defense was throwing money at any academic computer project that was working on \u2018artificial intelligence,\u2019 because they thought this was about, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have robots as soldiers, and the Terminator is going to be a soldier.\u2019 But [the idea of AI waking up] is ridiculous.\u201d", "James Altucher on storytelling:", "\u201cI was having this conversation with Steven Pressfield recently. He wrote The Legend of Bagger Vance, which became a movie with Will Smith and Matt Damon. It\u2019s about a golf tournament in Georgia in the 1920s. And he told me that every chapter in the story is the same, beat-for-beat, as the Bhagavad Gita. \u2026 That\u2019s a genius idea, because this is a text that has been \u2018focused grouped\u2019 by billions of people over 2,500 years, so we know it\u2019s a successful story. Just like the Bible is\u2014and a lot of people compare Star Wars to the story of Jesus. So when you take these ancient texts and apply it to a 1920s golf tournament in Georgia, that\u2019s certainly not plagiarism. That\u2019s smart writing.\u201d", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy", "Powered Outbrain", "Kayla Lacour", "Echo Esc_Html", "Wired_Get_The_Byline_Name", "Related_Video"], "keywords": ["scifi", "altucher", "podcast", "star", "wars", "thats", "science", "running", "going", "fiction", "business", "theres", "teach", "day"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
