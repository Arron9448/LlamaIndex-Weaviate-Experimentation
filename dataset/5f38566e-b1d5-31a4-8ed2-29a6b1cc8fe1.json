Even in normal times, I wouldn\u2019t be up for that.\u201d She can\u2019t be entirely sure if he was suggesting an illicit drink or a very quick-off-the-bat shag, but it wasn\u2019t a dilemma, at least. \u201cMaybe people\u2019s pheromones have gone funny,\u201d Rosie says, \u201cor maybe I secretly have Covid and can\u2019t smell anyone properly, but I\u2019ve had more smouldering frisson at the supermarket than I have on a date. I\u2019ve had sex just four times since March.\u201d", "For nearly a year, give or take the odd month, the rules introduced to fight the spread of coronavirus mean that, in England, sex between single people, or established couples who don\u2019t cohabit, has in effect been either illegal, or against regulations, or only allowed outdoors. To give that a sense of scale, 40% of people \u2013 rising to 71% among 16- to 29-year-olds \u2013 don\u2019t live in a couple.", "Things are not much better in the rest of the UK. Over the summer, Scotland exempted established couples from its household mixing ban, and in Wales an \u201cextended household\u201d could be formed, but like the \u201cbubble\u201d system in England \u2013 of which more below \u2013 none of this did much for people who weren\u2019t already together. Looking at the rules as a whole, Adam Wagner, a barrister specialising in human rights, concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s been a sad old year for everyone.\u201d", "As a result, talking to single people about their sex lives since the start of the pandemic is a labyrinth, a constant cross-check between what was allowed and what actually happened, told in a series of bizarre, dream-like sequences, from intense, anguished romances cut short by global circumstance, through muted misfires sucked dry by the vacuum in which they began, to bloodless, stilted dates in municipal parks or local supermarkets. It\u2019s like reading a short story told by Leo Tolstoy one minute and Ian McEwan the next. As Rosie puts it: \u201cThe park is just not a sexy place.\u201d", "Anna, 32, an account manager in Manchester who went into 2020 \u201csingle, dating, having lots of fun\u201d, describes total compliance at the start of lockdown: \u201cWe were told it might last just three weeks, and it\u2019s fine to not go on a date for three weeks.\u201d But I can almost hear her throwing her hands up, down the phone line. \u201cThis is nearly a year. You can\u2019t go for a year without exploring that side of yourself.\u201d Gordon, 43, a coach, describes single friends splitting into two camps \u2013 the ones who put everything on hold, and the ones having \u201cbootleg sex: we were going to do it, but not shout about it\u201d. Anna is now in a casual relationship, but \u201ccasual\u201d no longer connotes \u201ccarefree\u201d. \u201cYou still want to make it as safe as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you\u2019re making agreements about how many other people that person is seeing; ideally, you\u2019re only seeing each other. It\u2019s a constant negotiation. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d", "People who might want to settle down and start lives together are seeing their chances slip away.

You feel guilty and ashamed; it makes it impossible to maintain unless you move in together straight away.\u201d Did her flatmate ever object to her bringing someone over? \u201cHe could hardly \u2013 his [non-resident] girlfriend is here now.\u201d The flatmate issue is far more important than you might think, given that nobody ever talks about it. In June, the idea of bubbles was introduced in England, meaning that a single person could link with another household. Neal, 32, from just outside Liverpool, runs the Twitter account @reunitecouples, which campaigns for the government \u201cto grant noncohabiting couples the right to see each other again indoors\u201d. He points out: \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that support bubbles solve everything. But people living with their parents, or in a house share, aren\u2019t eligible.\u201d", "Faced with such a huge challenge to their sex lives, people tend to defer, not to the letter of the law, but to the most cautious person in the house. Rosie has two flatmates, both also single. \u201cWe agreed that we were allowed to break the rules if we were going to have sex. We weren\u2019t just allowed to go to any old mate\u2019s house, but if there was a goal in sight, then yes.\u201d", "For a short time, from 3 July, it was once again legal to go to somebody\u2019s house and do what you pleased there (except in Leicester, which was subject to a local lockdown): but only for a month, when new restrictions were introduced in the north of England. From this point until November, sex bans were switched on and off from area to area. There was a short period when only people on the Isle of Wight were allowed to have non-cohabiting or bubbled sex. The looser regulations around Christmas for tiers one and two meant you could conceivably have gone on a date, so long as it was on Christmas Day.", "All of which meant that some people started a relationship when it was legal, only to find that it was suddenly illegal. Neal, who is a primary school teacher, met his accountant boyfriend in October (it\u2019s pretty piquant to teach 30 kids a day, and the rest, and not even be allowed to sit in your partner\u2019s garden). Charlie, 46, who works for an NGO, has a tiny home. She met Karin in October on Lex, a queer dating app. \u201cIt came to an explosive head right as the November lockdown began. I think we got a hotel room the last night before they all shut.\u201d Karin was living with friends, so they had nowhere to go. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in Oxfam on Bloomsbury Street.\u201d Then non-essential retail closed. \u201cIt became Walthamstow Marshes. That was all we could do. That was thrilling; I felt like a teenager. I mean, I got no sex as a teenager, but how I imagine teenagers should be: star-crossed, tragic lovers. I was smitten.\u201d Karin went back to Scandinavia, where she\u2019s from, and is now locked down there.", "City parks have become the venue for illicit get togethers. Photograph: Alex Cambero/Getty Images/iStockphoto (posed by models)", "\u201cA lot of people are very angry,\u201d Neal says. \u201cThis is about more than me and my situation. From a safety point of view, we probably wouldn\u2019t be meeting anyway because he lives with his parents and they\u2019re in their 60s. My sense is that this hasn\u2019t become a bigger issue because people have taken things into their own hands. They\u2019ve decided for themselves what is safe and reasonable.\u201d It turns out you can only enforce abstinence by statutory instrument for a short time, before you create a large number of criminals. And if the people I spoke to are anything like representative, most of them are quite livid.", "The \u201cone rule for them, another for us\u201d indignation came up a lot, but its mascot was not Dominic Cummings but Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist who was busted in May for breaking regulations with his married lover.", "Echoed across everyone \u2013 gay, straight, in their 20s, 30s or 40s \u2013 is this sense that, for the government, \u201cthe nuclear family has been the priority\u201d, as Anna puts it. \u201cThe people who have bought houses, had babies, got pregnant, bought puppies. Everything else has been stripped away: this is what you should be doing.\u201d This anger didn\u2019t come from Covid denial or a lack of civic duty; rather, a sense of single people having been completely sidelined.", "People have taken things into their own hands. They\u2019ve decided for themselves what is safe and reasonable", "\u201cThe government\u2019s approach to it is so pathetic, so childish, so Tory,\u201d Rosie continues. \u201cEverything has to be family-friendly; there is no recognition that they\u2019re governing a nation of adults and having a sex life is part of being an adult.\u201d People in established relationships who don\u2019t cohabit feel the same way, Neal says \u2013 \u201cthat when the government talks about households, it\u2019s a certain model of society where we\u2019re all in our neat little family units. It doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the complexity of many people\u2019s lives today.\u201d", "It is not beyond the wit of modern society to accommodate this complexity. In Belgium, they invented the concept of the \u201cknuffelcontact\u201d, literally a hug-buddy, but widely understood, as Lotte, 37, phrases it, as \u201ca shagging exemption, although there is not a lot of liquidity in the shagging market these days\u201d. Last week, the Brussels Hotel Association appealed to knuffelcontacts to keep the industry alive by mini-breaking in their own capital. You don\u2019t get much more explicit than that: nobody goes to a hotel for a hug. In Italy, meanwhile, as far back as last April they introduced the \u201ccongiunti\u201d rule, a word that even Italians had to Google. The government finally clarified: it could mean \u201crelations, in-laws, spouses, cohabitants, long-term partners and loved ones\u201d. \u201cLoved ones\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. It seems a peculiarly British response, to think that sex will simply vanish if you ban it but don\u2019t really talk about it.", "This is not without consequence, the most obvious being that people who want to meet someone and start a family are watching that possibility slip away. \u201cI was 34 at the start of this,\u201d Becky says, \u201cand I worry about coming out of the pandemic aged 37, with all these crucial decisions taken away from me. I am not someone who is baby mad. But it brings home the gender difference between women our age and men our age; it doesn\u2019t affect them the way it affects us\u201d. Every woman in her 30s I spoke to felt this evaporation of choices keenly, and felt that the trade-offs hadn\u2019t been maturely weighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not even what my grandparents would want,\u201d said Rosie, \u201cthat their protection came at the cost of a generation of people not living their full lives.\u201d", "Broadly, people were more likely to put sex in the category of a human right than talk about it as a \u201cwellness\u201d or emotional issue, although Gordon describes the different mood of a Covid date. \u201cI definitely feel that people are much more open about being lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s become a little bit more Victorian. It does end up being in the bedroom at some stage, but there are a lot more walks. It\u2019s become more about people being desperate for human contact, it\u2019s serving an altered need. Sex is still going to feature, but talking online and to my fuckbuddies, there\u2019s more feelings and less showing off. The conversation is: \u2018Isn\u2019t this shit? I\u2019m feeling a bit crap, if I\u2019m honest with you. Shall we have sex?\u2019\u201d", "There is anger that the government\u2019s views of relationships are firmly focused on family values. Photograph: WireStock/Alamy (posed by models)", "People with long enough memories liken the situation to the HIV era. \u201cIt\u2019s a very recognisable sexual health discourse,\u201d Charlie says. \u201cWho else have you been seeing? When were you last with them?\u201d She calls Covid \u201cthe great monogamiser\u201d. \u201cThe illicit nature is usually because you\u2019re hiding a sexual truth from someone else. But this was purely pandemic-related, a social pressure. So there is a queer element to it, I couldn\u2019t help but feel. Wait, this is depressing, this is familiar \u2013 skulking around, not wanting anyone to know. It was kind of like second nature.\u201d", "But having forced monogamy on nascent relationships, the virus then makes it hard to take things forward. \u201cAll the natural ways of getting to know somebody, going to the pub, seeing how they act socially with their friends, how they act with your friends, all of that is gone,\u201d says Becky. \u201cIt\u2019s now: \u2018Do you want to go to the park and die of cold or illegally come to my house?\u2019\u201d", "In the groove of understanding that these are extraordinary times, in which everybody must play their part, and nobody is as ground down as NHS staff, who might themselves be single but are too busy even to worry about it, it is considered insensitive and irresponsible to even acknowledge rule-breakers as people, let alone consider their point of view. But, arguably, many of us are only rule-abiding because the rules acknowledge us (for instance, parents such as me who share custody of their children have been allowed to switch households through every restriction; but if regulations had forbidden that, I would have just ignored them).", "", "Coyness, from everyone, but policy-makers in particular, has erased the experiences of a huge number of single or non-cohabiting people. Laws have been made as if they either don\u2019t exist, or don\u2019t matter. \u201cHow can I go on living my life in such a way as I don\u2019t feel forgotten?\u201d asks Gordon.", "Names and some identifying details have been changed"], "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "keywords": ["allowed", "lot", "rosie", "breaking", "dont", "lives", "desperate", "seeing", "single", "start", "contact", "lockdown", "sex", "short", "human"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
