Why are they dragging those tanks here?\u201d Basova asks her neighbour.", "The 90-year-old worries she will have to go back to hiding in her basement to escape shelling in the war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region that recently entered its eighth year and has taken more than 13,000 lives.", "A massive buildup of Russian combat troops near Ukraine\u2019s eastern border \u2013 the largest since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to Nato \u2013 and the effective collapse of a ceasefire have sparked alarm in the west that Moscow is preparing to invade. Joe Biden has urged Vladimir Putin to de-escalate but Russia\u2019s threat on Saturday to expel a Ukrainian diplomat it accused of spying drew a warning of retaliation from Kyiv, further fanning tensions.", "Facebook Twitter Vera Basova at her home in Marinka. She has survived the second world war and eight years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists.

The neighbours\u2019 children play outside to the sound of birds singing and gunfire and skirmishes in the distance. From time to time an armed Ukrainian soldier walks down the street.", "Before the war, many of Marinka\u2019s residents commuted daily to Donetsk for work and shopping. Battles raged for control of Marinka in 2014 and 2015. There was direct artillery shelling on the town centre and heavy casualties, civilian and military.", "Basova recalls running away from \u201cfireballs in the sky\u201d and temporarily lost her hearing after suffering a concussion.", "When the frontline stabilised and Ukraine\u2019s hot war evolved into a simmering conflict, Marinka became one of the crossing points connecting government-controlled and insurgent-held sides of the Donetsk region. That was until the spring of 2020 when the pandemic closed the checkpoint and separated many families living on different sides of the so-called \u201ccontact line\u201d.", "Basova starts to cry as she talks about missing her daughter, who lives in Donetsk and has been unable to visit for over a year. Svitlana Derkach, Basova\u2019s 50-year-old neighbour, feels the same: she hasn\u2019t seen her newborn grandson in Donetsk. Derkach shows off a nicely packed teddy bear she made for the little boy.", "\u201cFirst, we got used to the war, but then coronavirus dealt us a new blow,\u201d she says.", "Derkach remembers bombs falling in her yard in 2016 and 2017. One of them killed her cat and another shattered the windows.", "She tries not to let herself panic, she says, about what it could mean for her if Russia\u2019s actions are not just sabre-rattling but the prelude to a full-scale invasion. \u201cIf something happens, I [will] just pull myself together,\u201d she says.", "Facebook Twitter Svitlana Derkach tending her garden in Marinka. \u2018Neither Europe nor the US needs us with our problems,\u2019 she says Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian", "In the meantime she seeds her garden with flowers and plans to bake paskas, the traditional cakes for Orthodox Easter in early May, with a new oven courtesy of a French humanitarian NGO.", "After talks with President Macron in Paris on Friday, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for a summit between Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Nato, the US and EU have all assured Ukraine of \u201cunwavering\u201d support for its \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d.", "But like most people in Marinka, Derkach has little faith that the west will help Ukraine if Russia invades. \u201cNeither Europe nor the US needs us with our problems,\u201d she says. But caught on the frontline of this conflict, Marinka seems to have been largely forgotten by the rest of Ukraine as well.", "When the war began in 2014, natural gas supplies were cut and have still not been restored. Most of the town\u2019s businesses were either destroyed by the fighting or ceased trading. Many of the fields in the agricultural hinterland are mined, which makes farming impossible. Drinking water has to be bought since the water in taps and wells is contaminated.", "Local people now mostly rely on their gardens for food, though the military advise them to work outdoors before noon, when there are fewer risks of being shot.", "Facebook Twitter Alina Kosse, director of a government-run arts and training centre in Marinka. She is doubtful of an economic revival for the town. Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian", "\u201cLife ends here in the second half of the day,\u201d says Alina Kosse, 62, director of the local government-run Creative Hub, an arts and training centre. Kosse is regretful but realistic about the chances of economic revival or of anyone reinvesting in Marinka. It used to have a population of 10,000 but nearly half of the residents have gone, either evacuating in the crisis of 2014-15 or leaving the town in the aftermath.", "Among those who remain, allegiances are divided and Kosse says she believes many local people are pro-Russian because they get their news from Russian TV and Ukraine has been unable to block broadcasts from Donetsk. Russian is the first language for most of Marinka\u2019s inhabitants although Ukrainian can be heard spoken by some older people.", "Kosse says explosives were thrown at her house because she helped the Ukrainian army. At the beginning of the war civilian volunteers donated new socks and underwear to the ill-equipped Ukrainian soldiers. Now help comes in the form of optical systems for weaponry and military drones. \u201cOur army is incomparable to what it was in 2014,\u201d she says. \u201cIf Russia dares to attack us again, it will bring about Russia\u2019s end soon. Believe me.\u201d", "Increased defence spending by Kyiv and seven years of combat experience have transformed the Ukrainian army from the disorganised volunteer force it was in 2014.", "Facebook Twitter Kaba, a Ukrainian soldier, says the Russians have \u2018nasty combat lasers that burn your retina if they hit your eyes\u2019.

They had also received training from British instructors. But he admits that they have been facing sniper fire from Donetsk since February which he believes is coming from highly trained and equipped Russian soldiers. \u201cThey have nasty combat lasers that burn your retina if they hit your eyes,\u201d he says.", "Kaba is from Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine and was originally an activist in the Euromaidan revolution which in 2014 forced the then president, Viktor Yanukovych, out of office. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea and backed the seizure by pro-Russian forces of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.", "Snipers and landmines are now the most common cause of death in the war zone, Kaba says. In mid-March, a Ukrainian soldier was killed by a sniper bullet near Marinka, while there are regular reports of people killed and wounded along the frontline. Amid the ongoing escalation soldiers pay little attention to Covid-19 although they are now being vaccinated.", "In the evenings Marinka is deserted apart from occasional groups of teenagers and stray dogs roaming the centre. A few men quietly fish at a local pond, ignoring the signs that it is mined.", "Facebook Twitter A charity-run bakery opened in 2016 by a Protestant church produces 1,000 loaves of bread a day.

Their windows are rattling from the shelling and they need to prepare bomb shelters again, they tell him. \u201cPeople got used to it being quiet, they repaired their houses and now everything is coming back,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fear they used to live in had faded and now it is returning.\u201d", "Basova survived the second world war and says she never thought she would have to endure another, even longer, war at the end of her life. When she hears shooting or shelling, she reads her prayer book to calm herself. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they need money?\u201d Basova says. \u201cI will give them my whole pension to stop the shooting.\u201d"], "authors": ["Oksana Grytsenko", "Simon Tisdall"], "keywords": ["mass", "fear", "marinka", "despair", "frontier", "russia", "twitter", "war", "ukraine", "town", "russian", "forces", "vlasovathe", "photograph", "ukrainian", "donetsk", "feels"], "pubDate": "2021-04-18T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
