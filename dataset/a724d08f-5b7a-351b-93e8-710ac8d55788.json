I\u2019d end up just with things that are good on chat shows, one-liners but no stories. I even tried to write a book once. It ended up two pages long.

A timely operation solved the cancer. The Parkinson\u2019s obviously hasn\u2019t gone away.

At the time he was, at Stephenson\u2019s insistence, facing up to the demons of his Glasgow childhood, what he smiled at calling his \u201cabandonment issues\u201d, enjoying the grandeur of the phrase. He had been having a lot of therapy, not least from his comedian-turned-shrink wife. She had written a book about him, with him, in which he revealed all sorts of darkness. How his mother had literally walked out on him and his sister when they were toddlers and they were apparently by themselves for some days before being discovered and reluctantly taken in by aunts. How his father, not long home from the war, often drunk, had \u201cinterfered with him\u201d, abused him over a period of years, experiences that had, he had come to understand, fuelled his own alcoholism. At the time we spoke, he had long been sober but seemed quite high on Californian introspection. Watching him on TV in recent years, I suggest he seems to have parked that phase, moved on from it.", "\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cI have got rid of it all. The thing therapy can teach you is you have to employ forgiveness in life. After my father\u2019s death, I thought all the bad stuff would go away, but actually it all came rushing back and dominated my thoughts. And I realised I had to take it all on directly.\u201d", "Stephenson \u2013 with whom he has three daughters, as well as a son and daughter from his first marriage \u2013 was obviously a gift in that regard: a blast of up-front Aussie courage to uncover all that was buried under layers of tight-lipped Scottishness and maleness and old-school Clydeside welder\u2019s banter. She also insisted Connolly had to move forward. \u201cThat kind of past is like a big rucksack full of bricks,\u201d he says now. \u201cYou can lug it around all your life if you like. Or you can find a way to put it down and walk away.\u201d", "He refused to see himself as a victim. \u201cI see people on daytime talk shows, and there is a line underneath saying how sexual abuse or whatever has ruined their life. I think it\u2019s a crime to say that of someone. It makes them a victim of something they are totally innocent of. I don\u2019t dwell on any of that in my past now. I don\u2019t do therapy any more, because I don\u2019t feel I need it.\u201d", "Part of the way out of for him was Buddhist meditation. I remember him joking to me the last time we met about how he had recently experienced the ultimate Hollywood moment: Shirley MacLaine had come up to him at a party to whisper how \u201ccentred\u201d he looked. Has he kept his practice up?", "\u201cAye,\u201d he says, with a beatific smile. \u201cThe mindfulness of breathing. I do it every morning, just to get me squared up.\u201d He catches some of the old Govan cadence. \u201cIt is dead easy. You just breathe and make yourself aware of breathing.\u201d He likes the fact it is called \u201cJust Sitting\u201d. \u201cLoosen your trousers, untie your shoes and just sit with your eyes closed for 10 minutes or so.

It was like going up a helter-skelter backwards. You know, the first time I had a sell-out at the London Palladium? That\u2019s very exciting.

Jamie and I were away fishing in Utah a couple of weeks ago. The Green River. We got to know all the guides, and we\u2019d go for dinner with them. A couple of times, I just sort of took over and told funny stories, and it felt great, and they were all roaring with laughter, Jamie too. It was a lovely feeling. Just letting it roll like that again. But no, I don\u2019t miss touring.\u201d", "He doesn\u2019t watch much comedy, he says.
