Throwing a sop to the religious right by cutting off federal money to organizations that provide vital health care, including reproductive health care, to underserved populations was shameful. But I can\u2019t say it was impeachable. The policy, which President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promptly revoked, was not in direct defiance of a congressional mandate. It just reflected a cynical calculation that the base mattered more than the welfare of tens of thousands of women and their families around the world.", "The degradation of environmental law enforcement was of a different order. As recently as the week before Inauguration Day, the Trump administration was issuing policy memos to limit the Justice Department\u2019s ability to enforce the nation\u2019s environmental laws, which the administration had spent the previous four years undermining. Last week, the Biden administration withdrew nine Trump environmental policies, some dating to 2018 and some as recent as last month.", "One measure of how far the Trump administration had gone to shield the fossil fuel interests that supported it came on Mr. Trump\u2019s last full day in office. On Jan. 19, the federal appeals court in Washington overturned the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rescission and replacement of the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Energy Plan, which had imposed strict limits on emissions from power plants. The unsigned opinion by a three-judge panel was nearly 150 pages long, but the court made its point near the beginning. \u201cThe question in this case is whether the Environmental Protection Agency acted lawfully in adopting the 2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule,\u201d the court said, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s power plant-friendly substitute for the original Obama plan. Answering that question, the court said succinctly, \u201cIt did not.\u201d", "Housing policy was another example of the former president\u2019s failure to \u201ctake care.\u201d The Department of Housing and Urban Development is supposed to enforce the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, purchase, rental and financing of housing on the basis of race and other protected categories. Almost until the last minute, however, the department\u2019s primary focus was on finding ways to curtail the act\u2019s enforcement by, among other things, raising the bar for what counts as discrimination, in defiance of the Supreme Court\u2019s more generous interpretation of the statute in a 2015 decision. On Jan. 26, President Biden ordered his housing secretary, Marcia Fudge, to revisit the Trump actions and to \u201ctake any necessary steps, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,\u201d to assure the agency furthers laws that mandate fair housing.", "I doubt there is a cabinet department without a similar story, and we can expect a steady flow of similarly worded orders as the Biden administration begins the project of repairing the damage. There is no heart-stopping video to dramatize a president\u2019s failure to do his constitutional duty. But as citizens, we also have a duty \u2014 to record, to remember and to not let it happen again.", "The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
