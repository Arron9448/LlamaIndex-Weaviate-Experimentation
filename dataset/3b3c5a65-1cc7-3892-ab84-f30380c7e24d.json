A small bump tucked into a nasolabial fold, my cyst was virtually invisible, but it bugged me, and one night, while watching TLC-star Dr. Sandra \u201cPimple Popper\u201d Lee bandage a patient\u2019s face, I realized there would never, ever be a better time for me to get rid of the thing. For starters, thanks to social-distancing measures, I hardly went anywhere or saw anyone other than my boyfriend. And when I did leave the house, I wore a mask. The tie-dyed silk facial coverings I\u2019d just ordered from Kes were both a chic prophylactic against disease and the perfect post-op disguise. Plus, I told myself, fear of COVID must be keeping the offices of dermatologists and plastic surgeons empty, right?", "Wrong. Demand for cosmetic interventions has gone up significantly over the course of the pandemic, with providers reporting a notable surge in bookings. There\u2019s not yet hard data on this phenomenon, but anecdotally, the experience of Michigan-based plastic surgeon M. Azhar Ali, M.D., seems typical. \u201cIt\u2019s been completely insane since we reopened in June,\u201d Ali says. \u201cThe amount of work I have, it\u2019s maybe even double normal conditions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls nonstop,\u201d echoes Samuel Lin, M.D., a plastic surgeon and associate professor at Harvard Medical School who in August noted a 30 percent increase in procedures\u2014specifically eye lifts and rhinoplasties\u2014compared with the same time last year.", "This uptick in business isn\u2019t hard to fathom. Thanks to the much-reported-upon Zoom effect, wrinkles and jowls and drooping eyelids that never bothered us before are now constantly broadcast back to us on 13-inch LED screens. Meanwhile, gym closures and stay-at-home orders have contributed to quarantine fitness ruts, which are driving interest in body-contouring technologies such as Emsculpt, according to Amy Shecter, CEO of Ever/Body, a storefront cosmetic-dermatology practice in New York City where the popular nonsurgical muscle-toning device that uses high-\u00adintensity electromagnetic energy to tighten abs and buttocks has been getting a lot of traction. And for many women\u2014myself included\u2014you just can\u2019t argue with timing. \u201cThe minute we shut down, I was like\u2014oh, my God, I should get surgery,\u201d recalls Candace Marino, an L.A.-based facialist who received her long-desired VASER liposuction from Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Charles Galanis, M.D., in May. \u201cThere was no way I could have fit two to four weeks of recovery into my schedule, given the hands-on nature of my work. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t get a breast lift, too.\u201d Likewise, Shealyn Hernandez, 33, a patient of Ali\u2019s, had been saving up for her \u201cfull mommy makeover\u201d\u2014breast augmentation, lipo, muscle repair, tummy tuck\u2014but she finally pulled the trigger this fall because she knew she\u2019d be able to convalesce at home. \u201cBefore, I would have had to take time off from my job,\u201d she notes. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, I\u2019m not going to my job anyway\u2026.\u201d", "\u201cEven the most fortunate people...they\u2019ve all lost some level of control over their lives, and one way of addressing that is by finding something to master. That could mean learning a new language, or it could mean getting a cosmetic procedure\u201d", "LOCKDOWN HEALING is both convenient and discreet. Marino told me that many members of her celebrity clientele have had work done in the past six months\u2014\u201ceverything they\u2019ve been waiting to do,\u201d she says\u2014precisely because they could recover in secret. That was my logic, too: Lara Devgan, M.D., the sought-after Upper East Side surgeon who removed my cyst, sewed up her teensy incision with a couture-worthy stitch, but the only person aside from me who got to appreciate her fine handiwork was my boyfriend; masks covered my sutures, and now they veil an angry-but-fading scar. The fact that many people\u2019s connection to the world is through FaceTime may account for the sharp increase in rhinoplasties observed by surgeons such as Harvard\u2019s Lin and Shaun Desai, M.D., assistant professor of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins. \u201cBecause the phone selfie is so distorting\u2014you see your nose as larger than it is, or misshapen\u2014nose issues seem more urgent.\u201d A barrage of increasingly triggering news updates has also certainly added to what Desai refers to as \u201ca perfect storm of demand.\u201d While it may not technically be true that we\u2019ve all aged 10 years in the last 10 months (though a wide range of studies has shown that chronic stress can accelerate the aging process), it certainly does seem that way, especially when sleepless nights are followed by early-morning video conferences that magnify the bags under your eyes. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going on vacation, they\u2019re not eating out at restaurants, and they\u2019re depressed and panicked and they want a pick-me-up,\u201d theorizes Ali. Indeed, all the doctors I spoke with for this story mentioned this \u201cfeel good\u201d factor.", "I would also like to propose boredom as the great un-\u00adanalyzed cause of our current aesthetic-enhancement boom, and I\u2019ll cite myself as Example A. Shocked out of my usual routine\u2014work, travel, exercise, socializing, et cetera\u2014I\u2019ve had time to fixate on stuff like my non-dangerous, virtually invisible cyst. And once the cyst was gone, fixation shifted to my neck, where\u2014over the course of umpteen Zoom calls\u2014I\u2019d noted a couple pale creases along my throat, which I promptly sought to address with a session of collagen-stimulating Morpheus8, a popular radio-frequency microneedling device at Ever/Body, where I was greeted at the door by a thermometer-wielding receptionist and guided to an ultra-sanitized treatment pod by a nurse practitioner wearing an enormous face shield (#pandemiclife). During the painful 45 minutes I was getting needled, I was not bored; but as soon as I left the clinic, I resumed my existential questioning of what I was going to do with the rest of my day, the rest of my strange year, the rest of my indeterminately on-hiatus life. Per usual, I set these thoughts aside, went home, and watched Dr. Pimple Popper."], "authors": ["Maya Singer", "Maya Singe"], "keywords": ["pandemicera", "plastic", "getting", "work", "way", "ali", "md", "rest", "surgeon", "thinking", "cyst", "going", "youre", "surgery"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
