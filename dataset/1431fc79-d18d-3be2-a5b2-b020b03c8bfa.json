The 18th-century Russian court, as visualised in The Great, a bonkers new satire from Hulu and Channel 4, is a hotbed of moral iniquity, vodka and bears. But, like most costume dramas, it is also about breasts.", "Take Lady Svenska, a courtier hellbent on ousting Catherine the Great. We know from her decolletage that she\u2019s a baddie long before she calls Catherine \u201ca bitch\u201d for refusing a biscuit. Then there\u2019s Georgina Dymov, the mistress of Catherine\u2019s husband, Peter III, whose libidinal interests are crystallised by the gold-plated pendant pointing directly towards her bosom.", "\u201cGiven Georgina Dymov\u2019s character, it would frankly be odd if Georgina was more covered up,\u201d says the show\u2019s costume designer, Emma Fryer. In the language of the show, the moral worth of female nobility is weighed up in their bust. Even Catherine abandons her high necklines when she starts having sex with her lover.", "The Great, which airs on Sunday nights and supplies a disclaimer in the opening credits \u2013 \u201cbased on historical facts, sort of\u201d \u2013 has been described as \u201canti-historical\u201d. It follows the marriage of the Prussian-born German princess Catherine and the Russian emperor Peter III, a relationship that ended with a death and a coup.", "Charity Wakefield as Georgina in The Great. Photograph: Nick Wall/Hulu", "If it borrows from history and plays loose with the facts, it is faithful to one thing: that contemporary fashion favoured the cantilevered look, and women were judged for the amount of cleavage they showed, depending on their age and social currency.", "A certain level of cleavage was considered fashionable in the late 18th and 19th centuries, says Susanna Cordner, a fashion historian who worked on the V&A\u2019s Undressed: A Brief History of Underwear. \u201cBut they were also frequently treated with derision in the press and in popular culture,\u201d she says, of breasts.", "All too often an overt cleavage was seen as a symbol of \u201ccoquettishness or feigned youth\u201d. This is seen in the cartoons of James Gillray and George Cruikshank, who used a woman\u2019s bosom as \u201cshorthand for impractical vanity or faux innocence\u201d. And all too often, age came into it: \u201cSometimes these commentaries [presented] the wearing of potentially revealing garments, particularly by older women, as poor taste,\u201d Cordner says.", "Elle Fanning as Catherine in The Great. Photograph: Jason Bell/Hulu", "For Fryer, the focus was character first, cleavage later. \u201cIt\u2019s not trying to be completely historically correct but de-robing, particularly in the background, was shown to add a sense of debauchery and anarchy,\u201d says Fryer, whose research came from the mid-Georgian portraits at the National Gallery, Givenchy and Dior, and, to an extent, reality TV.", "Breasts loom equally large in Bridgerton, the Netflix series that introduces us to courting season among the haute young \u201cbon ton\u201d of 1813 London. Set 50-odd years and many miles from Peter\u2019s (then Catherine\u2019s) Russia, Bridgerton leans as much on titillation and fiction as it does on etiquette and fact. But within the London ecosystem where Bridgerton is set \u2013 Bath, with CGI carriages \u2013 subtle class lines are also drawn around the neck area.", "If you\u2019re a social-climbing Featherington, you\u2019ll probably have them on display. The wily dowager Lady Danbury? There they are, too. But if you\u2019re an upper-class Bridgerton, you hide yours behind a marabou fan. Bridgerton\u2019s costume designer, Ellen Mirojnick, describes this Regency cleavage as \u201cmounds\u201d that \u201cmimic the cheek\u201d and as such, treats them like props from a fever dream.", "Ruby Barker in Bridgerton. Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix", "None of this went unnoticed by viewers. On Twitter, some queried how \u201clarge chested\u201d women coped. Others wondered if some breasts were fake. A 2,000-word article in the Smithsonian magazine queried their veracity altogether: \u201cCorsets and stays of the Regency period were designed less to create the cleavage that modern audiences find attractive and more to lift up and separate the breasts like \u2018two round globes\u2019.\u201d If they had used Regency style corsets, continued dress historian, Hilary Davidson, \u201cyou would have had boobs for days\u201d.", "The stratified worlds of 18th-century Russia and Regency England overlapped as much in class and imperialism as they did in fashion, at least according to these series. When it comes to cleavage, it was more of a byproduct of wearing a corset \u2013 or \u201cstay\u201d \u2013 rather than an explicit focus, says Cordner. Boned, and stopping around the diaphragm, they were a precursor to balcony bras. Their purpose was to support the bust and create the distinctive regency \u201cshelf\u201d silhouette.", "Nicola Coughlan in Bridgerton. Photograph: Liam Daniel/Netflix", "Fryer was at pains to remove the frills and frippery of 18th-century Russian necklines, a decision that was partly subconscious. \u201cWe wanted to blend historical drama with contemporary wear.\u201d Keen viewers of Bridgerton will have noted that younger characters, or those with less social currency, tended to wear a pelisse (a jacket) or chemisette, otherwise known as a false front. Much like Ganni\u2019s \u201cZoom\u201d collars \u2013 detachable pieces designed to liven up a plain top \u2013 these fronts could be removed and cleaned. Incidentally, in another bit of life and fashion switcheroo, sales of corsets are up almost 50% since the shows aired, according to eBay.", "These period dramas are not topical documentaries. But at their heart, are charismatic women acting as conduits through which to explore modern-day themes of sex and class .
