Kelly was the denim editor of Vogue at the time, in February 2015, and hosting a dinner for Levi\u2019s in Los Angeles. Noah, a guest, was immediately smitten, but Kelly\u2019s colleague and cohost Emma Morrison advised him to stand down; she was taken. Noah instead struck up a friendship with Kelly\u2019s aunt Marcia, also at the dinner party, and hers was the only number Noah left with.", "Cut to a few years later, at a mutual friends-giving dinner in Manhattan, and not only was Kelly single, but now it was her turn to be smitten. She had more luck than Noah did back in 2015. They were soon a couple, and engaged to be married on Noah\u2019s birthday in March 2020.", "Kelly and Noah spent their engagement living in lockdown with his family in East Hampton before deciding to elope on November 30, Kelly\u2019s birthday. They narrowed in on Big Sur, California, booked one of the best rooms at the aerie-like Post Ranch Inn, and invited a small group of West Coast friends to join for a celebratory dinner outdoors.", "Pandemic precautions taken\u2014Noah himself checked negative test results\u2014the couple ensured that their COVID wedding wasn\u2019t short on style or considered details, even if it was short on guests. Kelly outfitted almost every single person in a specific look from Thom Browne, for whom she is now director of brand relations, because she is, in her own estimation, \u201cinsane.\u201d (This is a woman who, raised in Tokyo, in high school wore her uniform with alterations and embellishments that garnered adoration and uniform violations in equal measure. Kelly leaves nothing sartorial to chance.) Noah wore a made-to-measure burgundy suit by Browne, the same color of Ruby, his newly launched hibiscus water beverage, and hand-signed by Thom himself. Kelly dipped into the archive to find a hand-beaded, wood-grain patterned look from Browne\u2019s fall/winter 2018 collection, which she paired with a blue diamond bracelet, a gift from Noah\u2019s mother, Susi, and also \u201csomething blue,\u201d as well as Manolo Blahnik heels, though she shortly abandoned them for her Converse sneakers. \u201cI will never forget being this snatched,\u201d she says. Her Biedermeier-style bouquet was a nod to Noah\u2019s German heritage, its white English roses tied into the English lace of her dress, and wrapped in dove gray Thom Browne grosgrain. (Officially, the dress code was, \u201cDon\u2019t fuck this up.\u201d It remains unclear whether this was an homage to RuPaul or simply a threat.)", "Nearly each of the guests had a nuptials-related duty. Pippa Bianco, the film director who is also Noah\u2019s oldest friend, officiated the private moment in which Kelly and Noah took vows at Wind and Sea House, a private home tucked off of Highway 1 that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. Photographer and best friend Daisy Johnson may have caught some of the ceremony, but the rest of the party observed from a terrace more than a hundred feet away. (Cheers erupted when we saw them kiss from afar.) Kelly\u2019s sister, known professionally as Holistic Chef Niki, prepared a plant-based feast, but broke her own regimen to include a special tri-tip roast procured from Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-sea, California, near where the Connor girls grew up. Artist and creative director Philippa Price designed a tablescape that included antique uranium glass that glowed green under her lighting design (which mercifully included heating lamps). Sam Harris, the lead singer and guitarist of X Ambassadors, was the musical entertainment for the night, and played \u201cBaby\u201d by Donnie and Joe Emerson for the first dance around the fire. A few guests pitched in by doing the dishes at the end of the evening. Perhaps the only person without an official duty was the mother of the bride, affectionately known everywhere as \u201cQueenie,\u201d who wore a truly killer necklace by Picasso, and earrings by Calder.", "With a wedding party so small, brunch the following morning was more akin to Sunday breakfast at a friend\u2019s house, playing Codenames, rather than the morning after a landmark life event. As everyone departed for drives up and down the California coast, and back to the reality of a pandemic, it settled on all the guests how grateful that we were to escape, safely, if only for the night."], "authors": ["Mark Guiducci", "Mark Guiducc"], "keywords": ["dinner", "elopement", "sur", "thom", "cliffs", "browne", "noahs", "director", "kellys", "groom", "party", "noah", "big", "kelly", "overlooking", "bride", "wore", "guests"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
