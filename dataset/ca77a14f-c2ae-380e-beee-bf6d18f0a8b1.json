Taiwan\u2019s president had to step down as leader of her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), a penance for its mauling in municipal elections. It was even far from clear that she would win her independence-leaning party\u2019s nomination to run for a second term. Still, in the presidential election in January she will beat her rival, Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT) or Nationalist party.", "That will be despite Mr Han\u2019s common touch and China\u2019s backing biddable media outlets in Taiwan and waging (dis-)information wars on social media. The mayor of Kaohsiung, the island\u2019s second-biggest city, has an oratorical flair that Ms Tsai lacks, and in the election will fire up (mainly older) working-class and rural voters. Attacking Ms Tsai for poor economic performance, his message will be that Taiwan\u2019s prosperity must come from hewing closely to China\u2019s vast markets. Mr Han\u2019s own family hails from the mainland. Taiwanese independence, he says, is \u201cmore scary than syphilis\u201d.", "But younger voters especially will decide that being dictated to by China is scarier still. If one factor accounts for a Tsai victory, it will be the ongoing anti-government unrest in Hong Kong. The \u201cone country, two systems\u201d envisaged after Hong Kong\u2019s return in 1997 was supposed to guarantee autonomy for the former British colony. Yet, more than Hong Kong, the Communist Party long intended the formula to apply to Taiwan, which the party sees as the last unresolved piece of China\u2019s civil war. The Communists rose to power in 1949 by vanquishing the KMT, whose rump escaped to rule Taiwan.", "Beijing\u2019s leaders meant \u201cone country, two systems\u201d and its application in Hong Kong to be an inducement for Taiwanese to return to the supposed motherland. In this context, China\u2019s breaking of its promises, including that Hong Kongers would be able to choose their own leaders, weakened what little appeal the formula might once have held in Taiwan. China\u2019s orders to crack down in Hong Kong and its support for police brutality there suggest that, so far as Xi Jinping, China\u2019s dictator, is concerned, the age of inducement is over.", "Backlash against Beijing\u2019s bullyingIn the long run, of course, China\u2019s aims are unchanged. Over Beijing\u2019s streets hangs a slogan of Mr Xi\u2019s: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the original intention. Stick to the mission.\u201d It is meant as a battle cry for political obedience and territorial integrity\u2014both stamping on dissent in the restive peripheries of Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and dragging Taiwan back to the fold. For now, however, China\u2019s hardline tactics mainly help Ms Tsai. Many of her countryfolk resent China\u2019s efforts to pick off Taiwan\u2019s remaining diplomatic allies, along with restrictions on Chinese tourist visitors intended to punish it economically. Ms Tsai\u2019s offering of shelter to a number of Hong Kong protesters is popular.", "Meanwhile, in 2020 Ms Tsai will be able to claim a boost for Taiwan\u2019s economy from an unlikely quarter\u2014the trade war between the United States and China. The threat of American tariff increases on made-in-China technology exports, plus China\u2019s own desire to source components from non-American suppliers, will work to the advantage of Taiwan\u2019s tech firms, particularly as China rolls out its 5g mobile networks. It will prove an incentive for Taiwanese firms to move their China production back to Taiwan.", "That will look like success for Ms Tsai\u2019s reshoring strategy, though too late for her to counter opposition criticism that the DPP has failed to boost the economy in recent years. Even though Ms Tsai will probably win the presidency, the KMT will gain narrow control of the legislature. With China growing more strident, even making military threats, and the opposition carping at home, it will be no easy second term.", "This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"Tsai again\""], "authors": [], "keywords": ["taiwan", "china", "taiwans", "ms", "presidential", "chinas", "taiwanese", "tsai", "kong", "hong", "turnaround", "party"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
