I saw him give a talk about the keys to happiness, and how one of the keys is living among friends, and how real friendship stems from being vulnerable with someone.\u201d", "In turn, de Botton\u2019s 2016 novel The Course of Love taught Styles that \u201cwhen it comes to relationships, you just expect yourself to be good at it\u2026[but] being in a real relationship with someone is a skill,\u201d one that Styles himself has often had to hone in the unforgiving klieg light of public attention, and in the company of such high-profile paramours as Taylor Swift and\u2014well, Styles is too much of a gentleman to name names.", "That sweatshirt and the Columbia Records tracksuit bottoms are removed in the quaint wooden open-air changing room, with its Swallows and Amazons vibe. A handful of intrepid fellow patrons in various states of undress are blissfully unaware of the 26-year-old supernova in their midst, although I must admit I\u2019m finding it rather difficult to take my eyes off him, try as I might. Styles has been on a six-day juice cleanse in readiness for Vogue\u2019s photographer Tyler Mitchell. He practices Pilates (\u201cI\u2019ve got very tight hamstrings\u2014trying to get those open\u201d) and meditates twice a day. \u201cIt has changed my life,\u201d he avers, \u201cbut it\u2019s so subtle. It\u2019s helped me just be more present. I feel like I\u2019m able to enjoy the things that are happening right in front of me, even if it\u2019s food or it\u2019s coffee or it\u2019s being with a friend\u2014or a swim in a really cold pond!\u201d Styles also feels that his meditation practices have helped him through the tumult of 2020: \u201cMeditation just brings a stillness that has been really beneficial, I think, for my mental health.\u201d", "Styles has been a pescatarian for three years, inspired by the vegan food that several members of his current band prepared on tour. \u201cMy body definitely feels better for it,\u201d he says. His shapely torso is prettily inscribed with the tattoos of a Victorian sailor\u2014a rose, a galleon, a mermaid, an anchor, and a palm tree among them, and, straddling his clavicle, the dates 1967 and 1957 (the respective birth years of his mother and father). Frankly, I rather wish I\u2019d packed a beach muumuu."], "authors": ["Hamish Bowles", "Hamish Bowle", "Tyler Mitchel", "Camilla Nickerso"], "keywords": ["think", "styles", "practices", "making", "really", "harry", "music", "real", "dressing", "meditation", "love", "keys", "living", "sweatshirt", "moment", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
