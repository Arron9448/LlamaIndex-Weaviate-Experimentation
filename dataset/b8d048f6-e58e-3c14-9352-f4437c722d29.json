Between lockdown orders, all-day Zoom marathons, and an endless progression of bone-chilling headlines, I\u2019ve spent the vast majority of the past year cooped up in my apartment, sitting on my couch, glued to my screens.", "As election news reached a fever pitch in early November, I was clocking well over four hours a day on my phone. That\u2019s sixty days a year spent scrolling Instagram, refreshing the New York Times homepage, and swiping aimlessly through old photos. Keep in mind that figure doesn\u2019t include time spent using other devices like my TV or laptop.", "With the new year fast approaching and election season behind us, the time has come to address my technology addiction head on, meaning I\u2019ve been on the hunt for more productive ways to spend time indoors this winter. I know myself too well to pretend I might take up some ambitious hobby, so instead, I\u2019m channeling my inner victorian heroine by taking to my bed with a good book, managing my handwritten correspondence, and otherwise upping my repertoire of analogue activities.", "1. Letter Writing", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the switch to remote work or the inability to see friends and family in person, but the volume of my digital correspondence has become completely untenable, to the extent that even personal communication is starting to feel like work. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m about to exit the group chat, but I will be making more of an effort to send physical cards, stay on top of birthdays, and spend less time firing off incoherent texts.", "Cocktail Stationery Set $18 PAPER SOURCE Shop Now Lively Floral Assorted Card Set $20 RIFLE PAPER CO.

Culinary Risk-taking", "There was a moment early on when I thought quarantine might actually be good for my mental and physical health\u2014a simpler routine, meal planning, homemade bread, that sort of thing. But after a few weeks spent aimlessly scrolling for recipes, I returned to my regularly scheduled delivery routine. There\u2019s just something about the experience of reading a physical cookbook that the internet can\u2019t replace. When a friend of mine sent me a copy of Ottolenghi Flavor, it proved to be the inspiration I needed to put my phone down and actually start cooking.", "Ottolenghi Flavor: A Cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi $32 BOOKSHOP Shop Now Yamazaki Cookbook Stand $18 WEST ELM Shop Now", "3. Reading the Classics", "I often wonder why, as an undergraduate English major, I was so desperate to avoid reading the assigned texts. I might have done things differently had I known that the tradeoff for not doing my homework would be a decade spent waiting for whatever stray literary reference would inevitably expose me as an ignoramus. Now, I\u2019m turning back the clock, covering my bases, and methodically making my way through the same course syllabus I once so diligently avoided.", "Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy $9 BOOKSHOP Shop Now One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez $16 BOOKSHOP Shop Now", "4. Listening to Vinyl", "I know, I know, I\u2019ve become what I always said I\u2019d never be: a twenty something living in Brooklyn with a record player on her bookshelf. I\u2019m not proud!

Doing Jigsaw Puzzles", "People who meditate love to ask if you\u2019ve ever tried it. Did you know it helps with anxiety? Mindfulness? Clear skin? Gut health? I always feel vaguely guilty when I say that yes, I have tried it, and no, it\u2019s just not for me. Puzzles, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be the meditative escape I needed in 2020."], "authors": ["Grace Stearns", "Grace Stearn"], "keywords": ["bookshop", "spent", "ive", "reading", "cookbook", "involve", "dont", "know", "shop", "indoor", "screen", "theres", "physical", "staring", "activities", "im"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
