Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Wednesday the city would close five of its Covid-19 vaccination sites, including Dodger Stadium, because of a supply shortage. Credit Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times Facing a shortage of coronavirus vaccine doses, Los Angeles will temporarily close five of its inoculation sites, including one of the country\u2019s largest, at Dodger Stadium, raising new questions about the federal government\u2019s handling of supplies and distribution. By Thursday, the city will have exhausted its supply of the Moderna vaccine for first-dose appointments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference. The centers will be closed on Friday and Saturday with plans to reopen by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re vaccinating people faster than new vials are arriving here in Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned as your mayor that our vaccine supply is uneven, it\u2019s unpredictable and too often inequitable.\u201d The United States has struggled to mount a mass vaccination campaign in the face of limited supply and logistical hurdles. President Biden has promised to administer 100 million vaccines by his 100th day in office, which falls on April 30. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 34.7 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, including about 11.2 million people who have been fully vaccinated. The federal government has delivered about 68.3 million doses to states, territories and federal agencies, with many kept in reserve for second doses. State and federal officials have come under fire for their handling of vaccines, as demand far outpaces supply and health care providers struggle to predict how many doses they might receive. About 10 percent of Californians have received a vaccine, according to C.D.C. data. The city-run Dodger Stadium site opened on Jan. 15 and vaccinated more than 85,000 people in its first two weeks, despite waits that could sometimes last hours. Administrators have reduced wait times, and the site was averaging more than 6,000 shots a day last week, far more than the city\u2019s other sites. As of Wednesday, Los Angeles had received 316,947 doses, had administered 98 percent of those and had 5,201 on hand, according to city officials. The demand for the vaccine has only increased in recent days, with health care workers and residents aged 65 or older eligible to receive the shots. The total number of shots given out on Wednesday was a daily record, with nearly 19,000 vaccinated at the five sites and at two mobile clinics. But Mr. Garcetti said Los Angeles had received only 16,000 new doses of the vaccine this week. Starting in December, California faced a dramatic spike in virus cases concentrated in the southern part of the state and in its main agricultural region, the Central Valley, as well as the spread of a new local strain that may be more transmissible. California now leads the nation in cases and deaths. Infections peaked around the holidays and have declined since mid-January, but deaths remain at record highs. Mr. Garcetti said that hospitalizations in Los Angeles were down to about 3,700 on Wednesday, the lowest number in months. Dodger Stadium was one of several mass vaccination sites to open at stadiums and convention centers across the country. The sites typically give out doses by the thousands in a drive-through format, allowing people to remain in their vehicles. But the mass-vaccine model has run into supply, technical and logistical problems. In Dallas, city officials struggled with technical glitches in its appointment registration system that led to people being turned away at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. Two mass vaccine sites in Arizona, at State Farm Stadium and the Phoenix Municipal Stadium, were not in danger of running out of vaccine, but officials were limiting appointments at the sites based on the anticipated supply of the Pfizer vaccine, said a spokesman with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Despite shortage concerns, Los Angeles will continue its mobile vaccination program, Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to see the outbreaks and, quite frankly, the unequal deaths that we\u2019re seeing in communities of color,\u201d he said. Derrick Bryson Taylor, Karen Zraick and", "A coronavirus variant was detected for the first time inside a U.S. prison. Credit... John Moore/Getty Images Officials in Michigan have confirmed the presence of a highly contagious coronavirus variant in one of its state prisons, the first such case documented in an American correctional facility \u2014 and a potential harbinger of even wider dispersion of the virus in prisons, public health officials said. Michigan prison and health officials said Wednesday that an employee at the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility, in Ionia, Mich., was found to have been infected with the B.1.1.7 variant. That strain was first detected in December in the United Kingdom. It has been found to spread more easily than other coronavirus variants. The variant\u2019s potential to disseminate rapidly in prisons and jails, which are typically overcrowded, unsanitary and have poor ventilation, has alarmed public health experts. \u201cWhen we see increased levels of contagiousness in spaces that are overcrowded that really do not lend themselves to social distancing, what we know is going to happen is that there will just be really an explosion of cases,\u201d said Lauren Brinkley-Rubenstein, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. \u201cAnd so it just means more cases, more rapid transmission, and more devastation for incarcerated people and staff that work in jails and prisons.\u201d Correctional facilities and detention centers have already been devastated by Covid-19, with more than 600,000 infections and 2,700 dead among inmates and correctional officers, according to a New York Times database tracking infections in prisons, jails and detention centers. Michigan prison officials said that once they had confirmed the presence of the variant, they ordered daily testing of all inmates and staff members in the prison, which has more than 1,600 inmates. As of Thursday, about 500 inmates and 100 correctional officers at the facility had been infected with the coronavirus, and one inmate had died. As of Thursday morning, it was not clear whether anyone at the prison \u2014 aside from the staff member \u2014 had been infected by the new variant. But prison authorities have expressed concern about the possible diffusion of the variant because inmates had been transferred from the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility to two other prisons, the Duane Waters Health Center and the Macomb Correctional Facility, before officials were aware that the staff member had been sickened. The Duane Waters facility, in Jackson, is reserved for some of the state prison system\u2019s most severely ill inmates. The prison system \u201cwill be taking extra steps to identify where this variant is present amongst staff and the prisoner population and we will continue to do everything we can to keep the prisoners, our staff and the community safe,\u201d Heidi Washington, director of the Michigan prison system, said in a news release.

People waited in line to receive the Moderna vaccine in San Diego last month. Credit... Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser for Covid-19, said Thursday that most members of the general public could become eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine as soon as April. \u201cAs we get into March and April, the number of available doses will allow for much more of a mass vaccination approach,\u201d he said in an interview with the \u201cToday\u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie. States have so far been prioritizing vaccines for older people and health care and essential workers, as well as residents of long-term care facilities. Dr. Fauci has said in the past that vaccine availability was likely to increase significantly through the spring. \u201cI would imagine by the time we get to April, that will be what I would call, for better wording, \u2018open season,\u2019\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cNamely, virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start to get vaccinated.\u201d It would take \u201cseveral more months\u201d after that to get the vaccines into most people\u2019s arms, he said, adding that he hoped the overwhelming majority of people in the United States could be vaccinated by mid- to late summer. Although vaccine distribution in the United States has so far been plagued by confusion, difficulties and delays, the average number of shots administered daily has been increasing steadily since late December. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 1.56 million doses were given on Wednesday, bringing the latest seven-day average to more than 1.5 million a day. The supply of vaccines is also growing, though it is still well below demand. Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have been gradually increasing production. The F.D.A. could authorize a one-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson later this month, and other vaccines from Novavax and AstraZeneca could also be authorized for U.S. use in the spring.", "These fake masks looked real, and sold by the millions. A seizure of counterfeit masks at a port warehouse in El Paso, Texas. Credit... U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, via Associated Press Many were clever fakes. They were stamped with the 3M logo and shipped in boxes that read, \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d But these supposed N95 masks were not produced by 3M and weren\u2019t made in the United States, federal investigators said on Wednesday. They were counterfeits, and millions were bought by hospitals, medical institutions and government agencies in at least five states, the federal authorities said as they announced an investigation. Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, said the masks were dangerous because they might not offer the same level of protection against the coronavirus as genuine N95s. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they meet the standards,\u201d said Brian Weinhaus, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations. Cassie Sauer, the president and chief executive of the Washington State Hospital Association, said that about two million counterfeit masks might have made it into the state. They were \u201creally good fakes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey look, they feel, they fit and they breathe like a 3M mask,\u201d Ms. Sauer said. News of the investigation came the same day the Homeland Security Department\u2019s intelligence branch warned law enforcement agencies that criminals have been selling counterfeit coronavirus vaccines online for \u201chundreds of dollars per dose.\u201d Michael Levenson and", "Dozens of countries are using the pandemic to clamp down on speech, according to a new report. A woman walking near Anichkov bridge in St. Petersburg, Russia. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The coronavirus has been used as an excuse to restrict free speech in dozens of countries, according to a report released Thursday by Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy organization. Pointing to cases of censorship, arbitrary arrest and physical assault, the report found that at least 83 governments around the world have used the pandemic to justify silencing critics or preventing peaceful assembly. It found that in at least 18 countries, military or police forces assaulted journalists, bloggers or critics of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, and that in at least 10 countries, officials used social distancing concerns to prevent or disband protests, even while allowing other large gatherings. The findings expose a tension at the heart of coronavirus restrictions: Some of the same tools officials have used to save lives and slow the spread of Covid-19 \u2014 such as restricting large gatherings, countering misinformation or instituting lockdowns \u2014 can also be used by authoritarian governments as a pretext to monitor citizens or quash dissent. China, Cuba, India, Egypt and Russia are among the countries where the restrictions on free speech have been felt most broadly, according to Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe obligation of governments to protect the public from this deadly pandemic is not a carte blanche for placing a chokehold on information and suppressing dissent,\u201d Gerry Simpson, associate crisis and conflict director at the organization, said in a news release. The report relied on research from Human Rights Watch as well as data and reports from other nongovernmental organizations including the United Nations.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Massachusetts will vaccinate companions who accompany older people to appointments. A mass vaccination site at Fenway Park in Boston. Credit... Charles Krupa/Associated Press In a bid to get more residents age 75 and older vaccinated, Massachusetts officials say they will also inoculate the people accompanying them, regardless of age, to mass vaccination sites, which can be confusing to navigate. \u201cThe idea for a mass vaccination site can seem a bit daunting,\u201d Marylou Sudders, the secretary for health and human services in Massachusetts, said at a news conference on Wednesday. The knowledge that the person accompanying them to the vaccination site will also be inoculated, Ms. Sudders said, may \u201cbring an extra level of comfort to those who may be hesitant or don\u2019t want to bother their caregiver or loved one or a good friend to book an appointment.\u201d Massachusetts has administered almost a million vaccine doses at nearly 130 sites statewide, said Gov. Charlie Baker. About 10 percent of residents have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 2.8 percent have received two doses, according to a New York Times tracker. Starting on Thursday, companions can schedule their vaccine along with that of the older resident. Joan Hatem-Roy, the chief executive of Elder Services of Merrimack Valley, a nonprofit group in northeastern Massachusetts, called the idea \u201ca game changer.\u201d \u201cI get nervous going to a Patriots game at Gillette, so I can imagine a senior trying to think about going to Gillette Stadium,\u201d one of the vaccination sites, Ms. Hatem-Roy said. Some expressed concern that younger people who are less susceptible to serious illness from the virus might be vaccinated before people who are 65 or older or who have chronic health conditions. But Mr. Baker said the immediate goal was to make sure people 75 and older are vaccinated. \u201cThose communities are far more likely to lose their life and get hospitalized as a result of Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we make it as easy as we possibly can for folks who fall into that over-75 category to get vaccinated and to get vaccinated early in this process.\u201d The state\u2019s decision to vaccinate companions came as a surprise to Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, who said Massachusetts had not moved as quickly as he had expected on vaccinations. He said he would rather see more vulnerable groups be deemed eligible for the vaccination first and for any transportation issues to be resolved without companions getting shots. \u201cI do know that the governor is feeling a lot of pressure to improve the performance in the state,\u201d Dr. Jha said. \u201cThat may be part of the motivation for doing this, because it will certainly bump up those numbers.\u201d He did not expect other states to follow suit \u2014 at least not right away. But Dr. Jha said it might be different in April or May, when the vaccine supply may outweigh the demand. In some places, a similar model has been tried on a smaller scale. In Albemarle County, Va., 70 caregivers and family care providers for people with intellectual disabilities were vaccinated, according to local affiliate NBC29. In Texas, older and disabled residents said they wanted their home health workers to be vaccinated, but many workers were declining the inoculation, according to The Texas Tribune. With fraud already popping up in vaccines, tests and stimulus checks, Dr. Jha worried that scammers might try to use the new Massachusetts program to take advantage of older residents. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you carefully police that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are bad actors who may try to manipulate this.\u201d Ms. Sudders offered her own warning on Wednesday, urging older residents\u2019 not to accept offers from strangers to be their vaccine companions.", "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is barred from Instagram over false coronavirus claims. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressing a rally against coronavirus-related restrictions in Berlin last year. Credit... Sean Gallup/Getty Images Instagram took down the account of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the political scion and prominent anti-vaccine activist, on Wednesday over false information related to the coronavirus. \u201cWe removed this account for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines,\u201d Facebook, which owns Instagram, said in a statement. Mr. Kennedy, the son of the former senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, worked for decades as an environmental lawyer but is now better known as an anti-vaccine crusader. A 2019 study found that two groups including his nonprofit, now called Children\u2019s Health Defense, had funded more than half of Facebook advertisements spreading misinformation about vaccines. He has found an even broader audience during the pandemic on platforms like Instagram, where he had 800,000 followers. Though Mr. Kennedy has said he is not opposed to vaccines as long as they are safe, he regularly endorses discredited links between vaccines and autism and has argued that it is safer to contract the coronavirus than to be inoculated against it. Facebook is becoming more aggressive in its efforts to stamp out vaccine misinformation, saying this week that it would remove posts with erroneous claims about the coronavirus, coronavirus vaccines and vaccines in general, whether they are paid advertisements or user-generated posts. In addition to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s Instagram account, the company said it had removed multiple other Instagram accounts and Facebook pages on Wednesday under its updated policies. They did not include Mr. Kennedy\u2019s Facebook page, which was still active as of early Thursday and makes many of the same baseless claims to more than 300,000 followers. The company said it did not automatically disable accounts across its platforms and that there were no plans to take down Mr. Kennedy\u2019s Facebook account \u201cat this time.\u201d Children\u2019s Health Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Members of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s family have spoken out against his anti-vaccine efforts, including a brother, sister and niece who accused him of spreading \u201cdangerous misinformation\u201d in a column they wrote for Politico in 2019. Another niece, Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, a doctor at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, wrote an opinion essay in The New York Times in December challenging his claims. \u201cI love my uncle Bobby,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI admire him for many reasons, chief among them his decades-long fight for a cleaner environment. But when it comes to vaccines, he is wrong.\u201d", "A doctor was fired after giving out Covid-19 vaccine doses that were about to expire. Dr. Hasan Gokal in his home in Sugar Land, Texas, on Tuesday. Credit... Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times A Texas doctor with only six hours to administer expiring doses of a Covid-19 vaccine inoculated 10 people, but the move got him fired and charged with stealing the doses. The doctor, Hasan Gokal, had scrambled in December by making house calls and directing people to his home outside Houston. Some were acquaintances; others, strangers. A bed-bound nonagenarian. A woman in her 80s with dementia. A mother with a child who uses a ventilator. After midnight, and with just minutes before the vaccine became unusable, Dr. Gokal gave the last dose to his wife, who has a pulmonary disease that leaves her short of breath. For his actions, Dr. Gokal was fired from his government job and then charged with stealing 10 vaccine doses worth a total of $135 \u2014 a misdemeanor that sent his name and mug shot rocketing around the globe. \u201cIt was my world coming down,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Friday. \u201cTo have everything collapse on you. God, it was the lowest moment in my life.\u201d The matter is playing out as pandemic-weary Americans scour websites and cross state lines chasing rumors in pursuit of a medicine in short supply. Late last month, a judge dismissed the charge as groundless, but the local district attorney vowed to present the matter to a grand jury. And while prosecutors portray the doctor as a cold opportunist, his lawyer says he acted responsibly \u2014 even heroically. \u201cEverybody was looking at this guy and saying, \u2018I got my mother waiting for a vaccine, my grandfather waiting for a vaccine,\u2019\u201d the lawyer, Paul Doyle, said. \u201cThey were thinking, \u2018This guy is a villain.\u2019\u201d", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "A new diplomatic currency: Covid-19 vaccines. A dose of vaccine manufactured in India being administered in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in January. Credit... Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most in-demand commodities and has become a new currency for international diplomacy: Countries with the means or the know-how are using coronavirus vaccines to curry favor or thaw frosty relations. India, the unmatched vaccine manufacturing power, is giving away millions of doses to neighbors friendly and estranged. It is trying to counter China, which has made doling out shots a central plank of its foreign relations. And the United Arab Emirates, drawing on its oil riches, is buying shots on behalf of its allies. But the strategy carries risks. India and China have vast populations of their own that they need to inoculate. Although there are few signs of grumbling in either country, that could change as the public watches doses be sold or donated abroad. \u201cIndians are dying. Indians are still getting the disease,\u201d said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. \u201cI could understand if our needs had been fulfilled and then you had given away the stuff. But I think there is a false moral superiority that you are trying to put across where you say we are giving away our stuff even before we use it ourselves.\u201d For India, its soft-power vaccine drive has given it a rejoinder to China after years of watching the Chinese make political gains in its own backyard \u2014 in Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Nepal and elsewhere. Beijing offered deep pockets and swift answers when it came to big investments that India, with a layered bureaucracy and slowing economy, has struggled to match. So India has sent vaccine doses to Nepal, a country that has fallen increasingly under China\u2019s influence. And Sri Lanka, in the midst of a diplomatic tug of war between New Delhi and Beijing, is getting doses from both. The donating countries are making their offerings at a time when the United States and other rich nations are scooping up the world\u2019s supplies. Poorer countries are frantically trying to get their own, a disparity that the World Health Organization recently warned has put the world \u201con the brink of a catastrophic moral failure.\u201d With their health systems tested as never before, many countries are eager to take what they are offered \u2014 and the donors could reap some political good will in reward. \u201cInstead of securing a country by sending troops, you can secure the country by saving lives, by saving their economy, by helping with their vaccination,\u201d said Dania Thafer, the executive director of the Gulf International Forum, a Washington-based think tank. Still, efforts to use vaccines to win hearts and minds aren\u2019t always successful. The United Arab Emirates, which is rolling out vaccines faster than any country except Israel, has begun donating Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine doses that it purchased to countries where it has strategic or commercial interests. But in Egypt some doctors balked at using them, because they said they did not trust the data the U.A.E. and the vaccine\u2019s Chinese maker had released about trials. And the government of Malaysia, one of the Emirates\u2019 biggest trading partners, declined an offer of 500,000 doses, saying that regulators would have to independently approve the Sinopharm vaccine. After regulatory approval, Malaysia bought vaccines instead from Pfizer of the United States, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and one made by another Chinese company, Sinovac.

Workers in leisure and hospitality industries have been hit especially hard by job losses during the pandemic. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times Even as layoffs in the United States remain extraordinarily high by historical standards, unemployment claims continue to decline as coronavirus cases and restrictions on activity recede. New claims for unemployment benefits declined last week for the fourth week in a row, the Labor Department reported Thursday morning. Last week brought 813,000 new claims for state benefits, compared with 850,000 the previous week. Adjusted for seasonal variations, last week\u2019s figure was 793,000, a decrease of 19,000. There were 335,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federally funded program for part-time workers, the self-employed and others ordinarily ineligible for jobless benefits. That total, which was not seasonally adjusted, was down from 369,000 the week before. New coronavirus cases have fallen by a third from the level two weeks ago, prompting states like California and New York to relax restrictions on indoor dining and other activities. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck at this very high level of claims, but activity is picking up,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist with ZipRecruiter, an online employment marketplace. Indeed, job postings at ZipRecruiter stand at 11.3 million, close to the 11.4 million level before the pandemic hit. The improving pandemic situation has eased the strain on dining establishments, Ms. Pollak added. More generally, however, the leisure and hospitality industry is still under pressure. Plenty of other signs of weakness remain. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added just 49,000 jobs in January, underscoring the challenges for the nearly 10 million unemployed. President Biden cited the weak showing to press for approval of his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. It would send $1,400 to many Americans, provide aid to states and cities, and extend unemployment benefits that are due to expire for millions in mid-March. Ms. Pollak said postings by employers at ZipRecruiter in recent days offered hope. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen employers smash all of our expectations and show a great deal of exuberance,\u201d she said."], "authors": ["Derrick Bryson Taylor", "Karen Zraick", "Manny Fernandez", "Ann Hinga Klein", "Jennifer Jett"], "keywords": ["sites", "closes", "doses", "los", "vaccine", "shortages", "covid19", "vaccines", "states", "vaccination", "supply", "health", "angeles", "vaccinated", "updates", "coronavirus", "live"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
