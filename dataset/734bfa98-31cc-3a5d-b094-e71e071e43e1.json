{"paragraphs": ["Introduction", "By the mid-2000s, Blu-ray felt like the future of media. Blu-ray video looked incredible and offered cleaner picture and sound quality than previous media formats. \u201cSurely,\u201d we thought, \u201cthe technology that comes after Blu-ray will look even more impressive!\u201d But then something strange happened; as streaming services like Netflix took off, more and more of us ditched physical media in favor of the cloud. Streaming didn\u2019t offer the same level of fidelity as Blu-ray \u2013 or sometimes even DVD \u2013 but it was good enough. More importantly, it was convenient. The desire to watch anything anywhere outpaced our desire for image quality.", "Now it\u2019s 2019, streaming services have come a long way, and tech goliath Google thinks it has figured out how to Netflix the gaming industry. The tech is surprisingly functional, but its ability to upturn the industry will depend largely on its ability to implement its grand blueprint. Sadly, Stadia\u2019s current design is missing several important pillars.", "Gaming on Stadia", "Gaming on Stadia", "Stadia\u2019s concept still sounds a bit like science fiction: Earlier this year, Google sold a vision of players using wi-fi-enable controllers to communicate with a hive of supercomputers in the cloud, which would allow users to stream the most advanced gaming software to decade-old laptops and mobile phones. Google\u2019s system worked well at trade shows, but those were highly controlled environments. How does the service work now that we\u2019ve been able to test it in the wild? Surprisingly well \u2026 if you have a stable internet connection.", "On the whole, Stadia performs better than I expected. The high-speed internet at the Game Informer offices regularly gets download/upload speeds of 280 Mbps, so I rarely noticed even a hiccup while playing games at work. Mortal Kombat 11 on a stable Stadia connection booted up in seconds and feels about as responsive as its console counterparts. I had no problem dialing in combos and Fatalities even though my inputs had to travel through miles of infrastructure to bounce off Google servers.", "Unfortunately, the experience quickly degrades as your internet speeds dial down. At a nearby coffee shop, where I recorded download speeds of 38 Mbps, I noticed a few frame skips every couple minutes. At home, where my speeds regularly drop to 20 Mbps, I experienced some visual artifacting and a regular picture stutter. With these slower internet speeds, I didn\u2019t feel competitive in Destiny 2\u2019s PvP modes, but I was able to complete a strike without a problem. Everyone\u2019s tolerance for this kind of experience will vary, but my frustration over the occasional hiccup was mitigated by the revelation that I could play Destiny 2 in public on my phone (see the controller sidebar for more).", "Stadia\u2019s service only dropped out completely on me once due to a poor signal, but an instance of my game was saved and I had five minutes to hop back online and pick up where I\u2019d left off. I wish Google would extend that grace period and allow users to create their own save states (a feature called State Share, which is still in the works), but I never lost any progress in a game, and my experience was stable enough across the board that I didn\u2019t live in fear of being unable to access my games.", "Google\u2019s service isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all streaming solution, and you should carefully measure your internet speeds before committing to the platform. Many will find Stadia\u2019s occasional stutters unbearable, while others will feel that it\u2019s good enough. Personally, I can\u2019t imagine trading any of my game consoles for a Stadia stream anytime soon.", "What about that controller? An online-only streaming service seems like a bold new direction for the gaming industry, but Google isn\u2019t interested in reinventing the controller. The Stadia controller smartly hews close to modern controller design. The pad itself has a nice weight and feels a lot like the PS4 controller thanks to its ergonomic shell and symmetrical analog sticks. The buttons produce a satisfying click and feel sturdy, and I got about seven hours of use from a single charge. Of course, Google has its equivalent of the start, options, and home buttons. However, Google added a screen capture and virtual assistant button to the mix, and this creates a jumble of buttons near the center of the controller. I constantly hit the screen-capture button when I meant to pause a game, which was frustrating. At launch, the controller also doesn\u2019t work wirelessly with any device other than the Chromecast. This means that in order to play on a laptop or phone you have to connect your device to a controller using a USB C cord, which I found cumbersome. In fact, I was actually a little embarrassed to pull out my tangle of gadgets to play games at Starbucks. I also wasn\u2019t able to connect the Stadia controller to wi-fi that featured a web browser login, meaning you probably won\u2019t be able to use Google\u2019s controllers wirelessly in locations like hotels that -require a secondary login screen. The Stadia controller might be a nice piece of physical hardware, but these tech issues need to get ironed out as soon as possible.", "Under Construction", "Under Construction", "Google\u2019s streaming tech might be ready for prime time, but its service certainly isn\u2019t. Many of the more exciting features either aren\u2019t available for launch or won\u2019t roll out until 2020. For starters, Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones are the only phones that Stadia users will be able to use for streaming at launch. Achievements also won\u2019t be viewable at this time, but Google says that Stadia is recording your progress, so once the feature is enabled, users will receive credit for everything they\u2019ve done since then.", "The Google Assistant is another exciting feature that is being kicked down the road. During the Stadia reveal event, Google said that with the tap of a button users could speak into their Stadia controller and pull up YouTube walkthroughs or other helpful advice for any game they played. This feature is absent at launch. Google says that the Google Assistant will be available soon, but even then, the Assistant will only be available from the Stadia home screen and only allow users to launch games or turn on their TV.", "Stadia\u2019s incomplete feature list is so long it\u2019s a little embarrassing. What about Stream Connect, which is Google\u2019s way of supporting multiplayer by allowing Stadia users to create local couch co-op experiences via split-screen? Coming later this year. What about Family Sharing, which lets you share games with other users in your family? Sometime soon. What about Crowd Play, which lets streamers play games with their viewers? Hopefully, sometime next year. What about streaming over cellular networks? I\u2019ll let you take a guess. If Stadia had all these features, it might feel like the next big leap in gaming, but as it is, the platform is just a basic streaming platform that offers less than a home console.", "In the end, Stadia's biggest problem is likely its lack of software. Stadia doesn\u2019t have many dedicated experiences that will drive longtime gamers to the platform. The system\u2019s launch lineup features some great games, such as Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Red Dead Redemption 2, but those are all more than a year old and there isn\u2019t a single triple-A exclusive on the horizon. This is a big problem for Google. If the company hopes to attract more people to the service, it needs to provide a reason to be on Stadia. In other words: It needs more games.", "A look at Google's data center that allows Stadia to run", "Launch Lineup", "Google Stadia Launch Lineup:", "Assassin's Creed Odyssey", "Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2", "Destiny 2: The Collection (available in Stadia Pro)", "Farming Simulator 2019", "Final Fantasy XV", "Football Manager 2020", "Grid 2019", "Gylt", "Just Dance 2020", "Kine", "Metro Exodus", "Mortal Kombat 11", "NBA 2K20", "Rage 2", "Rise of the Tomb Raider", "Red Dead Redemption 2", "Samurai Shodown (available in Stadia Pro)", "Shadow of the Tomb Raider", "Thumper", "Tomb Raider 2013", "Trials Rising", "Wolfenstein: Youngblood", "Reportedly Releasing Before The End Of 2019:", "Borderlands 3", "Darksiders Genesis", "Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2", "Ghost Recon: Breakpoint", "The Bottom Line", "The Bottom Line: 6 out of 10", "Stadia seems tailored for a different crowd \u2013 the kind of game-curious individual who only pays attention to the occasional blockbuster release and isn\u2019t willing to throw down a few hundred dollars on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware. Next year, when Google launches the free version of the Stadia service, the platform might find that audience. On the other hand, Stadia\u2019s service isn\u2019t currently valuable enough to justify the $129.99 early adopters price tag. Anyone devoted enough to follow industry trends probably cares enough about this hobby to spend the extra money on a console that provides a lag-free experience.", "Still, I want something like Stadia to succeed. Purchasing a game and immediately booting it up without concern for downloads or updates is liberating, and when you have a stable internet connection, streaming games off the cloud feels like magic. Oddly enough, Stadia filled me with excitement for a game-streaming future, but it left me with less confidence that Stadia would be the platform to usher us forward.", "Editorial Note: This review was conducted in a pre-release environment.
