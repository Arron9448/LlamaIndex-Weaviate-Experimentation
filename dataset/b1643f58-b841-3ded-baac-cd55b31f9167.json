During this time, his hyper-real photos of people set against backdrops of quirky seaside towns, village fairs and public swimming pools have captured the attention of an international fan base.", "Focusing mainly on what he describes as the \"leisure pursuits\" of the general public, his striking chronicles of normal people doing normal things have long offered a unique window into life in Britain. From working class families holidaying by the New Brighton seaside in the mid-1980s to more recent scenes from Extinction Rebellion and Brexit protests, his compulsion to capture the times we live in shows no sign of weakening.", "Barry Island, Wales. \"Barry Island\" (1996) Credit: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery", "Llantrisant, Wales. \"Llantrisant Working Mens Club\" (2009) Credit: Martin Parr/Magnum Photos/Rocket Gallery", "New Brighton, England.

Identifying as a \"classic remainer,\" he says he uses photography to reflect the tension he feels when he looks at Britain and, recently, the Brexit process. For Parr, photography is \"almost like a form of therapy.\"", "Widely regarded as one of Britain's foremost photographers, the Magnum member's work is not limited to the United Kingdom. He, like most working photographers, also takes commissions. He's shot fashion campaigns for Gucci and was commissioned by CNN to photograph the Republican National Convention in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election. At the time, he told CNN: \"Until you get to these things, you never quite know what you're going to see.", "\"This is not boring, everyday life. This is people with extreme political convictions.\"", "His photos often have a twisted sense of humor about them. A perverse, cheeky wink served up in the form of a still image.", "The photo on the cover of his recent book \"Only Human,\" shows a woman on the beach in Nice, in the south of France. With her flabby, leathery skin, old and orange, on full display she stands in front of the camera in a string bikini, clutching her toy dog. She looks both fabulous and ridiculous in equal measure.", "\"When I'm out shooting I'm looking almost for a little story, for a little vignette, where there's going to be some tension, some ambiguity, some contradictions... a peg to hang a story on really,\" he explains.", "Back at home, as Britain trudges through one of the most polarizing political moments in its modern history, Parr's love-hate relationship with his motherland feels all the more poignant. But he is insistent that while he has made his own position clear, his photography isn't one-sided, and can be interpreted in a number of ways.", "\"Everyone comes with their own baggage to pictures,\" he says. \"You know, I'm not going to change your point of view about anything politically, or on the Brexit front or to what extent you want to support climate change or extension rebellion.", "\"If you have your opinions and your prejudice and your baggage, you're bound to find arguments within my pictures to support them.\"", "The Black Country, West Bromwich, England. \"St George's Day.
