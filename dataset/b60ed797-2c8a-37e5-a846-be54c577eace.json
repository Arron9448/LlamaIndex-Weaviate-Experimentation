It singled out three products, managed by HSBC Asset Management, Ossiam and Lyxor, that held US oil producer ExxonMobil, a well-known green laggard. However, the HSBC and Ossiam funds said they had since sold out of the company.", "Climate Capital Where climate change meets business, markets and politics.
