So Padot is a fan of organised labour and feels a pull to vote Democrat.", "But after twice supporting Barack Obama in presidential elections, he cast his ballot for Trump in 2016. Nearly four years later, he has yet to be presented with a reason not to do so again.", "\u201cI\u2019d like to vote Democratic.

But in 2016 Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there, winning by more than 16,000 votes. Those votes alone delivered Michigan to Trump by the narrowest margin of victory \u2013 just 10,704 votes \u2013 in the history of presidential elections. The state, in turn, was an important part of the electoral college puzzle that put him in the White House.", "Trump\u2019s slim victory makes Michigan an important target for the Democrats this year along with other states that flipped to the Republican four years ago. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is returning to three counties in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa that swung from Obama to Trump to ask which way they will go in November.", "Opinion polls suggest that any of the leading Democratic candidates would beat Trump in Michigan although, 10 months before the election, they provide inspiration more than expectation to many Democrats fearful that the wrong candidate \u2013 too centrist or too liberal \u2013 could let Trump back in.", "\u2018He\u2019ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good\u2019", "While Trump commands the unwavering loyalty of a hardcore of voters, his victory was secured by people like Padot whose support is much softer. But, so far at least, many of them are still willing to back the president even though they have plenty of doubts. Trump has the lowest approval ratings at this stage of the campaign of any incumbent running for re-election since the 1970s.", "Like so many other swing voters, Padot voted for Trump to shake up the system. As things stand, he thinks the president will win again in Monroe county and nationally.", "\u201cEverybody knew he\u2019s a huckster but they were so mad at the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good.They might say there are these other things but once the curtain closes and they have to vote, then it\u2019s the economy.

Monroe county has jobs but the steady well-paid work relied on by thousands of people for decades disappeared with factory closures. In 2008, the local Ford car plant shut, taking with it 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. The knock-on effect of lost wages was felt by local stores and other businesses in downtown Monroe city, the county capital, dotted with ghost shops. A largely abandoned shopping mall sits on the edge of town.", "Monroe Democrats, still reeling from Trump\u2019s victory, are split on how to respond. Bill LaVoy, who held the local seat in the state legislature until he was swept out by the 2016 political whirlwind, backs the former vice-president Joe Biden as a safe candidate who can appeal to Democrats who defected to Trump.", "\u2018The Democrats think the only way they win is by appealing to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms\u2019", "On the other hand, a younger generation thinks the leadership is running scared when it focuses on trying to win back voters like Padot instead of offering a more radical alternative.", "\u201cThey lost to Trump and they\u2019re just so scared it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d said Christopher Slat, a 31-year-old Democratic campaign activist. \u201cThey think the only way they can do it is by trying to appeal to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms.

But a big question remains over how many will actually turn out to vote.", "Still, Slat is not writing off swing voters. He thinks some can be won back by focusing on what drove them to vote for Trump in the first place, and tying their disillusionment with the system to corporate corruption of politics. He said healthcare is a path into that because the high cost of insurance and treatment can be linked the medical industry\u2019s influence in blocking reforms that might reduce profits.", "\u201cYou tie it to the anti-corporate message because everybody understands the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, especially people who vote for Trump.

One of those has to be the best. So just copy that. How hard is that? But no, this is America. We\u2019ve gotta reinvent the wheel and it\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d he said.", "But then Padot is not impressed by any of the Democratic candidates.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of them are like Obama. That guy, he came out of nowhere. The guy could talk. He\u2019s very charismatic. I don\u2019t see that on any of these people,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden, I think his time has gone.

But he repeats the oft-heard criticisms about Trump on Twitter, although he excuses those tweets widely denounced as racist saying they are the result of the president\u2019s \u201csocial ignorance\u201d.", "There are limits for Burgess. He regarded Trump\u2019s threat to attack Iranian cultural sites as wrong because it is against the Geneva Conventions. Still, he has little time for the Democrats who he accuses of putting all their efforts into trying to unseat Trump.", "Meanwhile, he doesn\u2019t see any of them helping Monroe forge a new path to prosperity.", "\u201cI think life\u2019s getting tougher in this community because there\u2019s no good jobs that will pay for people to get above the poverty level.

I do personally believe that a lot of people voted to not vote for the establishment, that they\u2019re tired of it.

Based on that, I would say he will get re-elected again.\u201d", "Burgess thinks people put too much hope in politicians.
