McConnell added, \u201cBut this is precisely the kind of time for which the Framers created the Senate.\u201d That is true, even if his claim that the Senate would \u201crise above short-termism and factional fever\u201d is risible. Some of McConnell\u2019s Republican colleagues don\u2019t seem to be thinking any longer-term than how many times Trump might tweet about them before their next primary. But this is the Senate we have at an extraordinarily wrenching juncture in our history, and on Thursday, following the direction of the Constitution, Chief Justice John Roberts swore in its members as jurors. The seven House managers whom Speaker Nancy Pelosi named last week are now basically petitioners, coming in to make their arguments before senators whose votes may be fixed by partisanship. And yet they have a strong case to present.", "It could, no doubt, be stronger still. Just a few hours after McConnell spoke, Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, appeared on MSNBC in a doozy of an interview with Rachel Maddow. Parnas asserted that he had understood from Giuliani that they had Trump\u2019s approval to pressure officials in Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, former Vice-President Joe Biden\u2019s son, who had a paid seat on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Parnas described a plot involving, among others, Attorney General William Barr. The House also released (and sent to the Senate) documents related to Parnas which sketch out various wild schemes, including possible threats against Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Parnas has credibility problems; he is currently under indictment on campaign-finance charges, and his allegations need to be substantiated. Giuliani called him a liar, and Trump denied even knowing him, for whatever that\u2019s worth.", "And more revelations are sure to follow. The essential dilemma, with Trump, is that there is always a new path leading to the disaster site of his Administration: a Parnas interview; a hint from John Bolton, the former national-security adviser, that, if the Senate subpoenas him, he will have interesting things to say; a decision from the Government Accountability Office that the Administration\u2019s withholding of aid to Ukraine, during its pressure campaign, broke a law called the Impoundment Control Act. That finding may upend the President\u2019s argument that there was nothing illegal about his dealings with Ukraine. The decision was made public just a few hours before the senators were sworn in; Senator Chuck Schumer cited it at a press conference during which he expressed dismay that the trial might proceed \u201cwithout witnesses.\u201d", "Calling new witnesses in the Senate trial would require a simple majority, in a vote that is expected after each side presents its arguments. That\u2019s less than the two-thirds required for conviction, but, given the Republicans\u2019 majority of fifty-three, it still may be out of reach. The House Democrats might have done better to extend their pursuit of witnesses when they had the ability to do so in their own right\u2014that is, before they voted on the articles. They might have waited for some of the ongoing lawsuits concerning subpoenas to reach higher courts, in which case Chief Justice Roberts might be playing a more complicated role. But they didn\u2019t, and there is no going back. The impeachment is the House\u2019s expression of faith in its case, and it should not be forgotten that the managers already have powerful witnesses. More than a dozen testified in the House, defying the President\u2019s orders to stay away. Their damning accounts will be heard in the Senate and by the public, whether in video clips or in transcripts that the managers quote, and their words should resonate.", "There is Ambassador William Taylor, who testified that the nation\u2019s official agenda had been subordinated to the President\u2019s personal one; Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who heard Trump\u2019s July, 2019, phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky and recognized it as highly improper; the former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, who witnessed Bolton\u2019s explosion about what he called a \u201cdrug deal\u201d; and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who interacted with enough senior Administration officials (including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice-President Mike Pence) to conclude that \u201ceveryone was in the loop.\u201d There is also David Holmes, the diplomat who heard Sondland reassure Trump that Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d and would do anything he wanted. And there is Trump himself, who, according to the official notes of the July call, told Zelensky that he wanted him to \u201cdo us a favor.\u201d Indeed, the passage of time since the last witnesses testified may have obscured some of the richness of the record. (Who were the Three Amigos, again? Sondland, the former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and the former special envoy Kurt Volker.)", "Some Republican senators, such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, have argued that, if the House managers get to call more witnesses, the President should, too\u2014among them, perhaps, Hunter Biden. On Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris told CNN, \u201cWe need to have all available evidence,\u201d but, when asked about the younger Biden, she noted that there are rules about relevancy. Otherwise, \u201cyou could just say, \u2018I want Santa Claus to come forward.\u2019 \u201d Many Republicans, of course, regard Hunter Biden as highly relevant. There are no perfect answers here; a trial, in our confrontational system, is not meant to be precisely curated. The President, quite properly, should have the latitude to make the case that he deems strongest, just as he had the freedom, on Friday, to choose Alan Dershowitz\u2014apparently taking a break from defending himself regarding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein\u2014to help him make it.", "The message that, without new witnesses, the trial may prove a sham also risks reinforcing the Senate Republicans\u2019 complaint that the House sent them something shoddy and incomplete, and that they can\u2019t be expected to do the lower chamber\u2019s work for it. But their work is there; much evidence is in hand. The Republicans\u2019 craven indifference to the Constitution will be all the more clear to the public if the emphasis is on what the managers do have, rather than on what they don\u2019t. And then the country can judge the Senate. \u2666"], "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Luke Mogelson", "Jia Tolentino", "Alex Ross", "Erik Agard", "Connie Bruck"], "keywords": ["trumps", "ready", "democrats", "president", "trump", "senate", "witnesses", "trial", "parnas", "ukraine", "republicans", "managers", "impeachment", "house"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
