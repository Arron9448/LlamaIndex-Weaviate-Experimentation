Its people live mostly in traditional villages, their lives relatively unchanged for decades. Yet they are now being profoundly affected by climate change. I was there in 2019, working on stories about the crisis, reforestation and resilience projects. Most of the region\u2019s inhabitants make their living through cattle. Global warming isn\u2019t just causing droughts that affect crops and cause food shortages \u2013 it also means the cattle can\u2019t graze. So people are being forced to travel ever further to find water and food for themselves and their livestock. This creates conflicts over land and access to water.", "This girl, who was 10 or 11, lived in the village of Malawama. She is at the top of a massive baobab tree, collecting leaves for the family dinner \u2013 the tastiest are usually higher up. Baobab leaves are a popular meal in the region. They\u2019re similar to spinach and eaten as a side dish or added to soups and stews. I saw her from a distance and the image quickly caught my eye. I was surprised to see her climbing this huge tree unaided, but she moved so confidently that I soon stopped worrying. She was completely used to it \u2013 as most local people are.", "The mystical baobab has been deeply embedded in the Zinder people's culture for centuries", "The mystical baobab has been deeply embedded in Zinder culture for centuries \u2013 there are songs and stories about what they call the tree of life. As well as the leaves, its fruit is nutritious, its flowers and seeds have medicinal properties, and the wood and bark are used in a variety of ways. The tree has adapted to the environment: during the rainy season, it can absorb and store water, which means it can fruit and flower during the arid season. Elephants eat the bark for its water while its foliage and vast hollow trunk provide shelter for animals and humans. Baobabs are now being planted as part of a reforestation project, to help people deal with climate change. This tree gives me hope \u2013 it is part of a positive story about the region.", "For many years, I was a news photographer, working first in Spain and then in Kenya. I was often assigned to stories of conflict, but I think the media present a skewed image of Africa by focusing on negative stories. I want to look at the positive side, at the fantastic minds working to transform lives and do amazing things. I want to put my camera in those spaces and tell those stories. I\u2019m working on a project about a boxing school for girls from the slums of Nairobi. They\u2019re being taught to defend themselves and to gain self-confidence. Some are going on to become professional boxers. It\u2019s changing all their lives.", "Even villagers unfamiliar with climate change know their lives are changing, that the land is degrading and each day is getting tougher. It worries me that this is only the beginning, that things are only going to get worse.", "I love this image of the girl in the baobab tree because it\u2019s not spectacular. It\u2019s gentle and poetic, a regular scene in a Niger village. The area has been scarred by conflict and drought but life also goes on in a quiet way. This tree, and what it represents, makes me feel positive and peaceful.", "Luis Tato\u2019s CV", "Luis Tato.
