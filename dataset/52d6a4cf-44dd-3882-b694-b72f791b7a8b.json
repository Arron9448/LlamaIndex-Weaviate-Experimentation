Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum, like most sole proprietors, doesn\u2019t pay herself a fixed salary. Any money she makes first goes to cover her company\u2019s expenses; she lives on the remainder. In 2019, her gross sales added up to a modest five-figure sum, according to her tax return.", "After taking legally allowed deductions for equipment, insurance, travel costs and other operating expenses, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum reported and paid taxes on a profit of $458. Following the S.B.A.\u2019s rules, her lender, Wells Fargo, treated that as her annual salary and issued her a loan in August for the maximum amount for which she qualified: $95. (For that, the bank collected a $4.75 fee.)", "When she saw that number, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum assumed she must have made a mistake on her paperwork. She tried without success to speak with someone at Wells Fargo. She also reached out to the local S.B.A. office, where she said an official told her the loan couldn\u2019t be increased. Frustrated and defeated, Ms. Jeanchaiyaphum accepted the tiny loan.", "S.B.A. representatives did not answer repeated questions about the rules the agency created for sole proprietors. But lenders and accountants \u2014 who have spent months poring over the program\u2019s complicated and frequently revised rules \u2014 noted that the relief effort was focused on minimizing job losses, not preserving struggling businesses.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s payroll for a solo entrepreneur?,\u201d said Sean Mullaney, a financial planner in California who worked with several clients on their loans. \u201cThis was created in almost in a fog of war, and there\u2019s lots of scattershot things in it.\u201d"], "authors": ["Stacy Cowley"], "keywords": ["relief", "sole", "rules", "loan", "small", "taxes", "profit", "told", "jeanchaiyaphum", "loans", "businesses", "ms", "wells", "business", "joke"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
