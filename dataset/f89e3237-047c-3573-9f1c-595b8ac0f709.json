Some find a sense of ease by swaddling up in sweatsuits or slipping on their best leggings, while others feel most grounded when wearing their everyday clothes like, for example, their favorite button-down or dress. Here at Vogue, we\u2019ve heard from our colleagues who love to wear denim at home, and those who have discovered the joys of wearing a caftan.

Layer a pair of your best leggings under a house-worthy slip dress or a robe for a luxe look (and a little extra warmth). You can also go minimalist and style a plain black pair with an oversized men\u2019s white button-down.", "My personal favorites are stretchy pants with a flared leg.
