Some of the women begged her for her Mandarin notebook. \u201cI was, like, Why?\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey were, like, We know you are leaving! And I was, like, It\u2019s not certain!\u201d A guard winked at her and said that soon her name would be called on a loudspeaker, and she would be free. When the speaker blared, Sabit stood and waited for the door to be unlocked, as the other women wished her well. Then she returned to her room for her clothing. \u201cI finally took off the disgusting uniform,\u201d she recalled.", "Sabit was brought to the camp\u2019s Party secretary, who was waiting for her in a room with a chair, a small table, and a bed. She sat on the bed, and he lectured her, telling her that she needed to be more patriotic: \u201cYour life style was too individualistic\u2014completely fighting for yourself!\u201d Sabit was silently outraged. With the prospect of release before her, the doubts instilled by the camp\u2019s propaganda dissipated. She thought, Can only dying for China make me good enough for you? But she nodded and said, \u201cYes, yes. You\u2019re right.\u201d", "The secretary told her that a local Party official and his aide were waiting to take her to her uncle\u2019s home. As she walked from the camp toward their car, she thought about something that the other women had told her: \u201cDon\u2019t look back. It\u2019s a bad sign.\u201d She decided to heed their advice. But, glancing to the side, she saw a looming fa\u00e7ade across the road: a detention center. Breaking into a run, she raced to the waiting car.", "Vi. ERASURE", "In the year that Sabit had been confined, Chen Quanguo was transforming Xinjiang. Cherished symbols of Muslim heritage\u2014shrines, mosques, cemeteries\u2014were systematically targeted for destruction. Experts estimate that, since 2017, some sixteen thousand mosques have been razed or damaged, with minarets pulled down and decorative features scrubbed away or painted over. An official in Kashgar told Radio Free Asia, \u201cWe demolished nearly seventy per cent of the mosques in the city, because there were more than enough.\u201d In some cases, officials pursued an odd tactic: miniaturization. In 2018, the grand gatehouse of a mosque in the town of Kargilik was covered with a banner proclaiming, \u201cLove the Party, love the country.\u201d Then the structure was dismantled and rebuilt as an ersatz version of itself, at a quarter the size.", "The Uyghur and Kazakh languages were increasingly scarce in public, and so were their speakers. Within the first two years of Chen\u2019s crackdown, nearly four hundred thousand children were transferred into state-run boarding schools, designed to block the \u201cthinking and ideas\u201d that they might encounter at home. New infrastructure had to be quickly built to house the children, many of whom had \u201cdouble-detained\u201d parents. One orphanage worker told Radio Free Asia, \u201cBecause there are so many children, they are locked up like farm animals.\u201d Sabit recalled that mothers held in her facility were very pliant: \u201cIn order to see their children, they were willing to do everything.\u201d", "These children may mark a demographic milestone. Even as regulations on family planning had been eased across China, they were enforced ferociously in Xinjiang, with violations often punished by detention. Adrian Zenz, the academic, uncovered government records from 2018 which indicate that eighty per cent of China\u2019s increase in IUD use occurred in Xinjiang. Amid the myriad stresses imposed by the crackdown, the region\u2019s birth rate fell by a third that year. In areas where Uyghurs represent a larger share of the population, the declines were even sharper. \u201cYou see this incredible crash,\u201d Rian Thum, a historian at the University of Manchester who has studied the issue, said. The government doesn\u2019t dispute these figures, but it argues that they are a consequence of gender emancipation. This January, the Chinese Embassy in Washington went on Twitter to celebrate that Uyghur women were \u201cno longer baby-making machines.\u201d", "Kuytun, like all Chinese cities, is divided into neighborhood units, each overseen by a Party organization called a residential committee. Although Sabit had not lived there in more than a decade, she was still registered with the committee that oversaw her old home. The Party official who had come to the camp to pick her up was the committee\u2019s secretary, Zhang Hongchao. He was middle-aged but boyish, with the affect of an ambitious petty bureaucrat, skilled in pleasing people above him and bullying people below. He often wore Army-issue camouflage, and he kept the neighborhood under close watch.", "To assure Zhang that she had been re\u00ebducated, Sabit spoke of her gratitude to the Party\u2014words that poured out automatically, after countless repetitions. He seemed pleased. \u201cWe see you don\u2019t have so many problems,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been abroad, that\u2019s your problem.\u201d Then he advised her, \u201cJust stay and do something for your country. Don\u2019t think of going abroad for the next ten years.\u201d", "Sabit understood that this was not a suggestion. With little more than a nod, Zhang could return her to the camp. She reassessed her future. O.K., she thought, I won\u2019t die if I can never leave. \u201cCan I go to Shanghai?\u201d she asked.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a time.\u201d", "At her uncle\u2019s home, Zhang and his aide stayed for tea, along with \u201crelatives\u201d\u2014members of a cadre. Sabit\u2019s uncle later told her that, during her internment, he and his family had been designated \u201cfocus personnel.\u201d Every week, they had to attend re\u00ebducation classes and a flag-raising ceremony at their residential-committee center. Cadre members also visited, staying for meals and urging the family to serve drinks\u2014an indication that they did not obey Muslim strictures on alcohol. Initially, they spent the night, until they realized that they could photograph themselves in different clothes and fake an overnight stay.", "As the officials sat on floor cushions and sipped tea, Zhang and the head of the cadre explained that Sabit was confined to Kuytun. \u201cWe\u2019ll monitor you for some time to see how you\u2019ve transformed,\u201d one of the officials said. Sabit asked if she could shop or see friends, and was told, \u201cYou need to be cautious about whom you contact, but you\u2019re allowed to have friends.\u201d", "The sun set, and the officials stayed for dinner. After they left, Sabit\u2019s aunt recorded a voice message for Sabit\u2019s mother and texted it to her in Kazakhstan; a direct call seemed too risky. Then Sabit settled into a guest room decorated in a traditional Central Asian way, with a carpet on the wall and flat cushions for sitting or sleeping. Turning out the lights, she felt the warmth of family, the security of reclaimed comforts. For more than a year, she had never been alone, never slept with the lights off. The darkness and solitude felt both welcoming and strange. She wanted to rush to her sleeping relatives to explain, but decided that she was getting carried away. To calm herself, she used a trick that she had developed in the camp. She imagined herself listening compassionately to her inner monologue, as a parent would listen to a child. Soon, she was fast asleep.", "Kuytun had become an open-air prison. The city was ringed with checkpoints, where Uyghurs and Kazakhs were forced through scanners, even as Han residents passed freely. \u201cWe will implement comprehensive, round-the-clock, three-dimensional prevention and control,\u201d Chen Quanguo had proclaimed while Sabit was in captivity. \u201cWe will resolutely achieve no blind spots, no gaps, no blank spots.\u201d The technology was deployed to create a digital-age apartheid.", "In Xinjiang, the Sharp Eyes surveillance program had been wired into a large computing center, but sifting through the vast amount of image data had been time-consuming and, according to state media, \u201crequired a lot of manual work.\u201d As capabilities increased, so did the need for processing: at first, the surveillance systems could track only the movement of crowds, according to a former Chinese official; later, the technology could assess a person\u2019s gait, even her facial expressions. In the summer of 2017, the authorities unveiled the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi Cloud Computing Center, a supercomputer that ranked among the fastest in the world. With the new machine, they announced, image data that once took a month to process could be evaluated in less than a second. Its thousands of servers would integrate many forms of personal data. State media called the new machine \u201cthe most powerful brain.\u201d", "Lower-level Party officials struggled to keep up with the technological advances. Sabit asked Zhang Hongchao if she could walk around unimpeded. Unsure, he suggested that she and a Party official test her I.D. at a hospital. The next morning, when they swiped her card, it triggered an ear-piercing alarm. Police swarmed Sabit within minutes.", "After the experiment, she went to a mall to buy clothes. Almost immediately, police surrounded her again. An officer explained that facial-recognition software had identified her as a \u201cfocus person.\u201d Learning that she had already been re\u00ebducated, the officers let her go. But it soon became clear that there was nowhere Sabit could walk without being detained. Eventually, police began to recognize her, and, annoyed by the repeated encounters, urged her to stop going out at all. Instead, Sabit laboriously identified convenience stations that she might pass and gave the police notice, so that they could ignore the IJOP alerts.", "A few times a week, Sabit had to report to the residential-committee center, for a flag-raising ceremony and additional re\u00ebducation classes. She hated these visits, but they were her only escape from solitude. Except for her uncle\u2019s family, just about everyone she knew\u2014neighbors, friends, relatives\u2014stayed away from her, fearing that any association would land them in the camps, too.", "The only people she could safely mix with were other former detainees, who were similarly isolated. The Party propagandist in Sabit\u2019s cell had been fired from her job. The woman who had run a grocery store could no longer operate her business, so she turned to menial labor; she also discovered that the man she wanted to marry had found another woman. Shunned and vulnerable, they found safety in one another.", "Two weeks after Sabit\u2019s release, several officers from her internment camp turned up on her uncle\u2019s doorstep and explained that they had used her file to find her. It was not an official visit. They emphasized that they, in their own way, were also prisoners: resigning from the camp was impossible. Two of the officers were Kazakh, and they said that they lived in fear that any misstep would send them to the camps as detainees. One of them confessed that he had been drinking to ease his guilt and his nightmares.", "Because the men had been kind, Sabit and the other women decided to take them out to dinner, as thanks. The group started meeting regularly, and the officers soon began insisting that the women join them for drinks and give them loans. Sabit usually handed over the money, not expecting it back. But the officers became more demanding. One asked her to buy him a car, and, when she gently declined, his kindness gave way to threats. He called Sabit and, using the IJOP data, itemized where she had been the previous day. She decided that isolation was better than such company.", "Members of Sabit\u2019s residential committee constantly interfered with her life\u2014trying to mold her into the state\u2019s idea of a good citizen. They urged her to take a Han husband. There was money in it for her, they said; in an attempt to alter the ethnic balance of Xinjiang, the state had launched an aggressive campaign to encourage indigenous women to marry Han men. (Darren Byler, an anthropologist at Simon Fraser University who studies repression in Xinjiang, recently uncovered evidence that some Han \u201crelatives\u201d in Uyghur homes had coerced women into such marriages.) When Sabit demurred, the officials told her that Muslim men were chauvinists\u2014adding, with a laugh, \u201cHan husbands dote on their wives!\u201d", "The residential committee urged her to work, and then made it impossible. Sabit found a job teaching English, but on her first day the committee called her in for an unscheduled meeting with officials from her camp. She could not tell the school why she had to leave, fearing that she would be fired if her employer knew that she was a \u201cfocus person.\u201d At the meeting, she asked if she could speak first, so that she could return to her job. One of the officials responded with a threat: \u201cI can send you back to the camp with one phrase. Stay!\u201d She lost the job, and decided that it wasn\u2019t worth looking for a new one.", "By January, 2019, Sabit understood that this kind of attention was causing her uncle\u2019s community anxiety. Fearing that she was endangering her relatives, she moved into a hotel. One night, she returned to her family\u2019s home for a meal, and posed with them for a photo. She shared it on social media. Immediately, Zhang texted her about an embroidered portrait that was on the wall. \u201cWho\u2019s in the picture?\u201d he wrote."], "authors": ["Raffi Khatchadourian", "Raffi Khatchadouria"], "keywords": ["sabit", "zhang", "party", "crackdown", "officials", "camp", "women", "told", "sabits", "xinjiang", "surviving", "official"], "pubDate": "2021-04-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
