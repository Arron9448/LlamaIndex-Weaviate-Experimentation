They\u2019re forced, rather than seen as something that\u2019s part of our survival,\u201d she adds. \u201cWithout fire, we wouldn\u2019t exist. It is a tool, and it\u2019s something all of us need to learn to use wisely.\u201d", "Ultimately, governments will need to empower Indigenous people and groups like the Firesticks Alliance to bring cultural burning and traditional knowledge to the fore; \u201ccherry-picking\u201d their ideas or forcing them into a Western framework simply won\u2019t work. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who need to lead this, and link arms with government,\u201d Hromek says. \u201cOften it\u2019s the other way around, and the government wants to lead. But [as our co-founder] Victor Steffensen has said, \u2018Let us drive for a while, and you guys can take the passenger seat and come along on this journey.\u2019 If indigenous people aren\u2019t leading, then you aren\u2019t learning, and you aren\u2019t growing as an individual either. The social implications are really important. We\u2019re talking about the benefits for Indigenous people, but the social benefits for non-Indigenous people are just as huge.\u201d", "Beyond their on-the-ground work and cultural burns, Firesticks Alliance hosts workshops for farmers, corporations, and government agencies to further amplify indigenous voices and push for collaboration. \u201cIt\u2019s their knowledge,\u201d Standley says. \u201cThere\u2019s an awareness around cultural burning now, but it can\u2019t just be taken and published as Western knowledge. There should be employment outcomes for Indigenous people as well. There\u2019s a huge benefit to society, and the way this forms these communities.\u201d"], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr", "Talei El"], "keywords": ["burning", "western", "cultural", "knowledge", "whats", "meet", "firesticks", "land", "need", "network", "arent", "women", "protect", "indigenousled", "work", "indigenous", "way", "reviving"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
