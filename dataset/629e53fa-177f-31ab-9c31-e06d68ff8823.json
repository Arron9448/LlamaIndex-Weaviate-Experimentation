At around 12.30 on November 22nd 1963, as he was showing residents a film on how to repair a hiatus hernia at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, a little knock came at the door. And he and a colleague were called away to the emergency room two floors down. They half-grumbled on the way that they were often called out to situations described as \u201cterrible\u201d, to find they really weren\u2019t that bad. This one was.", "First, the elevator doors opened on a crowd of men in dark suits and hats, shoulder to shoulder. He was in a suit himself; no time to scrub up. Then he saw Jackie Kennedy, sitting on a folding chair in bloody clothing; and next, along in Trauma Room 1, President Kennedy himself, lying on a cart with the operating light full on him, his head a mass of blood and blood clots, his face cyanotic, swollen blue-black, with the eyes protuberant. He had been shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas. For a moment, Dr McClelland stood dumbfounded. Those wounds were surely mortal. But then he pulled on his surgical gloves, determined like his colleagues to make all possible attempts to revive him. That was his job.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Most vital was to establish an airway, then replace the blood. A tracheotomy had been begun through the wound in the anterior of the president\u2019s neck, so he joined in, using a retractor to hold the incision open. Meanwhile, unmatched blood and fluids were being pumped into the president and an anesthesia machine was assisting his breathing, for they all saw a possible agonal respiration, and his heart was working. Yet Dr McClelland, standing for ten minutes at his post at the president\u2019s head, found himself staring deep into the occipital part of the skull, where both bone and brain had been blasted away. He told his colleagues that the back of the head was gone. Such a wound could not be repaired, then or decades later for that matter. At 1pm Kennedy was pronounced dead.", "Afterwards they were asked to write reports on a single sheet of paper. Then it was back to work. They were shaken, but barely talked about it. He took his bloodied suit to the cleaner\u2019s\u2014had to, as he only had two\u2014but kept his shirt unwashed in a box. He had seen Lincoln\u2019s bloody shirt on display in Washington, and was fascinated both by the man and by the surgeon\u2019s attempts to save him after that pistol shot a century before. On his own shirt the president\u2019s blood had pooled at the cuff above his surgical gloves.", "Resuscitation was not his speciality. He was, and increasingly became over the next six decades, an expert in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery, specialising in resections of the liver, and famous round Dallas-Fort Worth for turning up at hospitals with Lin clamps in his car, ready to control any bleeding from the portal vein. But gunshot trauma was hardly unusual at Parkland. In 1963 he had been only a year in the surgical faculty, but he had also done a summer job and a general-surgery residency there, before becoming a full-time instructor of surgery in the next-door University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. In that time he had seen at least 200 gunshot wounds, for it was a city-county hospital for indigent patients, many of whom got mixed up in shootings.", "Two days later he was busy on yet another. The TV news told him that Lee Harvey Oswald, arrested for the killing of Kennedy, had been shot in turn, and he raced to Parkland to save him if he could. This was a pistol shot at close range to the abdomen, survivable if straight front-to-back. But Oswald had flinched aside\u2014as anyone would\u2014and the bullet had gone across the left side to the back, injuring the aorta and vena cava and causing such blood loss that he was white as a piece of paper. Again, Dr McClelland thought him unsalvageable. But he tried, opening Oswald\u2019s chest to massage his heart for fully 40 minutes, taking turns, before the heart grew flabbier and flabbier and then arrested for good.", "He was often asked why he had made such efforts to save him. First, because that was his job; second, because Oswald had been accused but not convicted. And he did not believe that Oswald had acted alone. He was no expert in physics or ballistics, and his knowledge of how bodies reacted to bullets was drawn mainly from deer-hunting in East Texas where he had grown up, eager to be a doctor like his grandfather. Still less did he have time for those nuts, conspiracy theorists. But he lived and breathed first-hand surgical experience. His office groaned with medical journals, and in 1974, with $2,700 from the bank, he started Selected Readings in General Surgery, a collection of the most useful new articles to save weary students searching. It became so popular that, at one time, some 60% of America\u2019s general-surgery residents were taking it.", "He would also happily scrub up and sit in on procedures if any resident asked him, working quietly on his laptop, assisting if needed. And it was as a surgeon that he formed his opinion about the Kennedy assassination, simply from what he saw that day. The neck wound might have been entry or exit, but the back of the head clearly showed a huge exit wound; so the first bullet probably came from the back, and the second from the front, from different gunmen. He refused to speculate beyond that; he was no more qualified to do that than anyone else. On that day he just did what he was trained to do, the best way he could, as they all did.", "Several other aspects went on troubling him. There was no post-mortem in Texas, against state law; the body went at once to Bethesda. He was shown autopsy pictures at the National Archives in which the exit wound was covered up. A colleague in Trauma Room 1 was sworn to silence. As the official account of the lone gunman settled in stone, he felt impelled to live and relive a story that was clearer in his mind\u2019s eye than the faces of his listeners: how he had stood staring into Kennedy\u2019s empty skull, how he had held Oswald\u2019s struggling heart in his hands. \u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/obituary/2019/09/26/obituary-robert-mcclelland-died-on-september-10th", "title": "Obituary: Robert McClelland died on September 10th", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["mcclelland", "shot", "heart", "head", "obituary", "10th", "save", "robert", "oswald", "kennedy", "blood", "died", "wound", "surgical"]}
