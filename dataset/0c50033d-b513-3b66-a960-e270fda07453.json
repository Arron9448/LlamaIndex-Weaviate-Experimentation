It will offer four quest types including a Beginner Quest, an Intermediate Quest, a Basic Training Quest, and a Wyvern Riding Trailer Quest so that players can enjoy riding some Wyverns. Capcom continues, telling players more about the demo saying:", "The Beginner Quest and Intermediate Quest can of course be played solo, but they are also available in local co-op and online co-op. For this demo, you\u2019ll get to explore the Shrine Ruins. This is a great locale for learning about the Wirebug and the new stat-boosting endemic life featured in this game. The Beginner Quest features Great Izuchi, while the Intermediate Quest has you take on Mizutsune, which we revealed today. Of course, you\u2019ll be able to take a Palamute and / or Palico with you, so you can experience riding a Canyne and receiving various kinds of support from your Buddies. The Basic Training Quest will teach you how to use the Wirebug, and the Wyvern Riding Training Quest will let you try out the new Wyvern Riding feature. Wyvern Riding is a new system that allows you to control monsters for a while, by dealing enough damage through aerial attacks or Silkbind attacks using the Wirebug, or by using turf wars or endemic life to your advantage. While controlling wild monsters, you can move around and attack, and you can even slam them into walls, so this is definitely something you\u2019ll want to check out.", "As for the game itself, Monster Hunter Rise debuts on Nintendo Switch this March 26.
