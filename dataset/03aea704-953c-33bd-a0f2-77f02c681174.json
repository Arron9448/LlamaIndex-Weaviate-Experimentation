I have been waiting on the doorstep of her house, feeling a little scruffy. This is compounded when we get inside: it is the most spotless home I have ever seen. It almost feels a little unreal, like a film set, as if I have stepped into a Ballas biopic (and someone should do one) where our heroine is sitting, looking perfect in tight denim, having very definitely made it.", "Ballas came to widespread public attention in 2017, at the age of 56, when she was made head judge of the TV dance competition Strictly Come Dancing. Now it seems the inevitable crowning achievement in an unstoppable career propelled by grit and talent, although she says it was \u201ca total shock\u201d.", "The 17th series of Strictly has just started \u2013 it is Ballas\u2019s third \u2013 and there is no sign that it is losing its sheen. It is a \u201cmagical\u201d show, she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s got everything \u2013 it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got glitz and glamour. You watch these people go through this emotional journey every single week and what you see is real. It\u2019s not staged.\u201d", "Her appointment seemed to repair some of the damage done in 2009 when a former judge, the vastly experienced Arlene Phillips, was replaced by the much younger Alesha Dixon, a former contestant, and the show was accused of ageism. Ballas is pleased if her appointment showed the power of older women. \u201cPeople seem to think that, by the time you hit 45 or 50, you might as well just pack it in and call it a day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like that in my own industry [dance] as well \u2013 it\u2019s run by men and an older woman just doesn\u2019t seem to have a part in anything. So, I think it flew the flag for everybody. Don\u2019t give up hope if you feel like you belong somewhere, or you can do it.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I think Strictly has everything \u2013 it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s got glitz and glamour\u2019 ... with her fellow judges, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Bruno Tonioli. Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC", "I tell her that I love that one of the biggest shows on TV is female-led \u2013 it is presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, while the production team is run by women. \u201cWell, I think they lead it better than men,\u201d says Ballas with a smile.", "We talk about how the quality of the dancing this series seems so high \u2013 \u201cSending somebody home each week is not going to be easy,\u201d she says \u2013 and about whether it is fair to pit people who have never danced before against former pop stars: \u201cIf everybody was the same level, could you imagine how boring it would be?\u201d She says she was \u201cvery sad\u201d when the former ballerina Darcey Bussell decided not to return as a judge, but that she was \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d when Motsi Mabuse, whom she has known for 20 years, got the job. \u201cWe have the same sense of humour, we\u2019re on the same page, she\u2019s from the same industry.\u201d She used to judge Mabuse in competitions. \u201cShe was just like this bottle of champagne \u2013 full of bubbles and sparkle when she danced.\u201d", "I mention the so-called Strictly curse, whereby some celebrities end up leaving their marriages for their dance partners. I have always wondered whether the producers are dismayed at such scandal rocking a family show, or pleased that it makes it more talked-about. \u201cThat question I couldn\u2019t answer; that\u2019s above my pay grade,\u201d she says. Is it inevitable that people fall in love when they dance together? \u201cYou mean to tell me in your office that\u2019s never happened? But ours happens to be on TV, on one of the biggest TV shows, and so it\u2019s just magnified. If you go into any industry, it happens all the time and it\u2019s not a big deal. But it seems to be when it happens on Strictly.\u201d Does everyone gossip about it behind the scenes? She smiles, hard as a diamond. \u201cI am there to judge a dance competition: I\u2019m there to judge your footwork, your rhythm, how you look and how you are. I am not there to judge your private life.\u201d", "By the time Ballas was 25, she had been engaged to three of her dance partners and married to two. \u201cMy mother collects engagement rings,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI remember my teacher telling me at 17: \u2018Everybody [in dance] gets married, Shirley.\u2019 And I said: \u2018But we hardly know each other.\u2019\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m competitive with myself all the time\u2019 ... Ballas in 1975.", "Ballas grew up in Merseyside, raised by her single mother, Audrey; her father left when she was two \u2013 \u201cNot a penny was given ... not even a pair of shoes\u201d \u2013 along with her older brother, David. Audrey, to whom Ballas is extremely close, took every job she could. She worked in a chocolate factory and went for a job as a forklift-truck driver there because it paid more. Audrey must have been the only woman, all 5ft of her, driving one of their forklifts in the 60s. It probably goes some way to explaining her daughter\u2019s determination.", "When Ballas was seven, she went to Brownies one night and noticed an adult ballroom-dancing class next door. She remembers standing on tiptoes to look through the window. \u201cI went in and asked the man: \u2018Do you do this for children?\u2019 He said: \u2018We\u2019re starting on Saturday.\u2019\u201d Ballas was hooked instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s the love of music \u2013 the minute it goes, I can\u2019t keep my feet still. I just feel like I need to keep moving and I just love everything about it. I think dancing was a way of showing your femininity and, through the years, your strength, because it\u2019s a male-dominated industry ... to still be standing in my industry today is huge, with the amount of people who\u2019ve tried to stop me getting where I\u2019m going.\u201d", "She started competing when she was 10. When she was 14, she moved to Yorkshire so she could be paired up with the young British ballroom champion, Nigel Tiffany. It wasn\u2019t difficult to leave home, she says: by now it was her dream to become a professional dancer. \u201cI just knew that we didn\u2019t have the resources,\u201d she says. They didn\u2019t have a car, or spare money, so ferrying her around the country to training sessions and competitions wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cMy mum said I was a very logical thinker.\u201d", "At 16, Ballas and Tiffany moved to London and got engaged, but Ballas\u2019s dance teacher advised her to have a try-out with another dancer, Sammy Stopford. Tiffany broke off their engagement. (He is now her financial adviser and one of her dearest friends. Stopford \u2013 whom she left for her second husband a few years later \u2013 lives on her road.)", "She and Stopford won lots of major titles, but then she met Corky Ballas, while she and Stopford were teaching in the US. Corky was handsome and charismatic \u2013 and her head was turned. Their son Mark, born when she was 25, was a \u201cpleasant surprise\u201d, but at that time, she says, most professional dancers didn\u2019t have children \u2013 or, if they did, their careers ended. \u201cI said to my mum: \u2018There\u2019s just no way I\u2019m going to be able to do this.\u2019\u201d", "Her mother stepped in, looking after Mark while Ballas and Corky travelled the world to compete, although often she would take him with them. \u201cIt was very, very difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019re young, you\u2019re striving for your own career. My mum was there, she took care of him.\u201d It helped, she says, that Mark \u201ccame out of the womb dancing. If the fridge light went on, he thought he was on stage. He loved to dress up. He got our industry.\u201d", "If I could go back to my younger self, I would say: \u2018You\u2019re fine as you are\u2019", "The Ballases won the International Latin American Dance championship when she was 35; she had won it with Stopford for the first time at 23. She retired from competition soon after. Was it hard to walk away? \u201cNo. At 36 \u2013 and Mark was 11 \u2013 it was enough.\u201d She had always taught and given demonstrations to earn a living, so she threw herself into this. They also took in the two children \u2013 Derek and Julianne Hough \u2013 of family friends (they are now renowned dancers in the US). Mark was showing signs of becoming a professional dancer, too.", "When she refers to her children, she means Mark and the Hough siblings, but also her niece, Mary, whom she helped raise after the suicide of her brother in 2003, at the age of 44 (Mary lost her mother not long afterwards). What was the effect of David\u2019s death on the family? \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother will ever get over it,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cNeither of us. He was very much the protector of the family. He was always the one who stood fast behind me, and then suddenly he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d She blamed herself, she says. They knew David was depressed, but not what it meant. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about mental health,\u201d she says. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t access. There was nothing on TV, there was nothing to read.\u201d Ballas had persuaded their mother to visit her in London, leaving David alone; they had no idea he was feeling suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ll live with that for ever.\u201d Tears spring in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to get upset, sorry.\u201d What she can do now, she says, her voice trembling, \u201cis campaign for the good of men\u2019s mental health\u201d.", "It hadn\u2019t been long since she and Corky had broken up. Growing up without a father meant \u201cthere was no gauge, really \u2013 what you\u2019re looking for when you get married, how should a man treat you? I didn\u2019t have any scale. So, you know, if you were badly treated, to me it was acceptable, when in actual fact, what I\u2019m realising now, is that it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Was she badly treated? \u201cI won\u2019t go into that part,\u201d she says.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s the love of music \u2013 the minute it goes, I can\u2019t keep my feet still\u2019 ... with Tonioli on Strictly in 2017. Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock", "She met her current partner, the actor Danny Taylor, when they were doing panto last Christmas. \u201cI never, ever thought in my lifetime I would meet a man who, with the exception of my brother \u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish the sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s just a really, really good man. He\u2019s definitely restored some confidence in me that perhaps I had when David was alive, but I haven\u2019t had since.\u201d", "She doesn\u2019t strike me as someone with low confidence. \u201cLower than you would imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the time. Even on Strictly, I can\u2019t deal with somebody telling me I look lovely. It\u2019s a personal thing for me.\u201d Being a dancer must give you an unusual amount of awareness about the way you look. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about your trade, you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself. You\u2019ve got those flimsy Latin dresses on, you know you\u2019re flashing your panties, you have to be in a good shape. But it comes at a price.\u201d", "Ballas doesn\u2019t lack confidence in her abilities as a judge and a teacher \u2013 she says it is her \u201csafe place, because I know my job inside and out. All my confidence I have is in my trade, and I think my own personal issues are my own personal issues, from different marriages and from different things throughout my life.\u201d", "Later this month, Ballas will have her breast implants removed, having become worried that they make mammogram screening more difficult. Her mother and aunt were both recently diagnosed with cancer, although not breast cancer. She had them in the first place, she says, because of a lack of confidence. \u201cIf I could go back to my younger self, I would say: \u2018You\u2019re fine as you are, and God makes people in different ways; we\u2019re all different shapes and sizes.\u2019 But I think when you have people telling you different things about yourself, it\u2019s like: chip, chip, chip, and you don\u2019t believe anything you\u2019ve got is nice or pretty. I think I got implants more because I was searching to find something that was beautiful, when perhaps I didn\u2019t realise, as Danny says, it\u2019s inner beauty that counts the most.\u201d", "What is impressive about Ballas, what counts the most, is what a grafter she seems to be \u2013 that and the way she has given her knowledge and support to countless proteges. At almost 60, with five decades in the business, she should be revered in the dance world. Largely, she is, but she describes an industry rife with bullying and vitriol, at least at the top. Although she is adamant she has no knowledge of anything that could fuel a #MeToo movement within the industry, she says it is a male-dominated world. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing well as a female and somebody feels threatened, then they make it difficult for you.\u201d One of the reasons she jumped at the Strictly job was \u201cbecause there were men at the top that were trying to push my nose out\u201d. She says she has been prevented from judging competitions, while couples she has trained have been told they would never win competitions if they stayed with her. How has she coped? \u201cYou have to have a steel spine, darling: you won\u2019t last five minutes in this kind of industry if you don\u2019t. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the same for any woman in any industry, at the top.\u201d", "Recently, one of the dancers she trained became a pro on Dancing With the Stars (the US version of Strictly) and he sent her a video of himself. \u201cI was crying, I was so moved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was his dream, and to see that boy live his dreams is \u2026 it just touches me.\u201d She likes to see people do well, she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a green bone in my body. I have not got a jealous streak of any type at all.\u201d But she must be competitive? She smiles. \u201cWell, that\u2019s different,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m competitive with myself all the time \u2013 everything from the way I look to how I do on TV.
