When the action started", "she had a goal rightly disallowed for an offside against Beth Mead during a first half in which Ellie Roebuck looked unusually nervous in England\u2019s goal, misjudging a couple of early crosses, dashing unwisely off her line and miscuing the odd bit of footwork.", "France\u2019s Marie-Antoinette Katoto (right) scores their third goal to make the game safe. Photograph: St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9/Reuters", "In fairness, Roebuck made a couple of excellent saves and could not be blamed for finding no riposte to Baltimore\u2019s fabulous finish into the top corner after the excellent Kadidiatou Diani\u2019s rapid acceleration down the right had caught cold a visiting defence missing the injured Houghton, Lucy Bronze and Demi Stokes.", "Having wrong-footed Rachel Daly and taken a steadying touch, Baltimore\u2019s shot left the Manchester City goalkeeper powerless, emphasising her status as the game\u2019s outstanding individual.", "Wonderfully direct as she dribbled at markers, the 21-year-old PSG forward was earning only her sixth cap but looked infinitely more experienced as she all too easily dodged Millie Bright and crossed in Val\u00e9rie Gauvin\u2019s direction.", "The Everton forward was at full stretch and slightly off balance as she met that delivery at very close range but still should have scored. Instead Gauvin failed to hit the target, offering England a significant reprieve as the ball flew over the bar.", "Nikita Parris and Chloe Kelly missed decent headed chances before France doubled their advantage. In the fallout from Roebuck brilliantly tipping Diani\u2019s long range shot on to the bar, Daly fouled Elisa de Almeida as she shaped to turn the rebound into the net and the referee pointed to the spot. Viviane Asseyi had only just come on as a substitute but her most assured penalty sent England\u2019s keeper the wrong way.", "Hemp \u2013 who quite possibly booked herself a place on the plane to Tokyo for this summer\u2019s Olympics \u2013 shifted the power balance, dragging England back into things. When the Manchester City winger was tripped by Marion Torrent, Kirby converted the penalty.", "Cued up by Hemp, Keira Walsh subsequently hit a post but Diani countered cleverly and her eventual defence-bisecting low cross left Marie-Antoinette Katoto to seal victory from close range.", "Riise\u2019s focus is on coaching Great Britain at the Olympics but England evidently have an awful lot of work to do if they are to prosper as hosts of next summer\u2019s delayed European Championship."], "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "keywords": ["defence", "friendly", "england", "exposed", "goal", "roebuck", "baltimores", "englands", "summers", "defeat", "forward", "france", "half", "white", "womens"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
