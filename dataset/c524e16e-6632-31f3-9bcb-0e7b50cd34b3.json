Completion of the Acquisition will serve to secure the availability of NLG development resources for Nintendo, including development expertise, as well as facilitate an anticipated improvement in development speed and quality by enabling closer communication and exchange of staff with the Nintendo development team.\"", "While the purchase is official, the acquisition itself won't be closed until March 1 of this year. It will be interesting to see what this more standardized move will mean for the team regarding future projects for the ever-growing and robust Nintendo Switch library.", "What do you think about Nintendo acquiring Next Level Games?
