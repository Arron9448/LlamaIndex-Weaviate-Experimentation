Kasiem had been incarcerated 38 years for a robbery and murder in the Bronx. Now a gangly, graying 65-year-old, he was known at Sullivan as the Old God. It was a reference to his affiliation with the Five-Percent Nation, an offshoot of the Nation of Islam whose members refer to men as \u201cGods\u201d and women as \u201cEarths.\u201d But I also thought of the nickname as a nod to the thoughtful steadfastness we saw in him.", "Several times, after Kasiem and Paulie returned from a medicine run, I heard Kasiem arguing with the pantry servers because they\u2019d forgotten to put aside a tray. He\u2019d hustle up a cake, heat some water for instant coffee and serve it to Paulie. Kasiem tried hard to follow physical distancing guidelines, because he saw himself as responsible not only for his own life but also for Paulie\u2019s. In early February, Paulie was supposed to go before a parole panel for the ninth time, to determine whether, after more than 40 years of being locked up, he\u2019d be allowed to leave. Given the pandemic, Kasiem thought Paulie might get his chance. Kasiem, scheduled to see a parole board for the first time in March, was hoping he\u2019d get his chance, too.", "In prison, everything that happens feels like part of our punishment. Over the last year, that has included living through a pandemic while behind bars. Critics of New York\u2019s vaccination plan point out that prisoners are already being punished for our crimes with incarceration \u2014 none of us were sentenced to be at extra risk during a pandemic too.", "As the lawyer and human rights advocate Bryan Stevenson has written, we are \u201cmore than the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d That\u2019s the ideal. Yet the worst thing we\u2019ve done is part of us, too; we are the sum of all our deeds. I murdered a man, and I sometimes feel that the act did diminish the value of my own life. I sometimes feel that I am less deserving of the vaccine than an innocent person.", "I called my mom in Fort Lauderdale and told her, over a phone handset that reeked of bleach and burned my nostrils, about the state government\u2019s decision not to offer us the vaccine. \u201cI can get it,\u201d Mom told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. I wish I could give it to you. I\u2019m not productive anymore. I\u2019m shot.\u201d Mom said she doesn\u2019t trust the vaccine, anyway \u2014 she thinks they injected water into Joe Biden\u2019s arm: \u201cHa, I sound like a nut, right?\u201d", "Mom\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s has robbed her of aging gracefully. She falls, urinates on herself. My older siblings had a different father, and they resented my mom for leaving them with him. She married my father, had me. Then he left her, and we wound up in a housing project. My father later took his own life. In 2001, when I was selling drugs, I shot and killed a man in Brooklyn and was sentenced to 25 years to life for murder, plus three years for drug sales and possessing a gun. One of my brothers died a decade later of an overdose. Now Mom is alone.", "The hardest part of my punishment is that it\u2019s also Mom\u2019s punishment. I\u2019ve felt it acutely these last several months, unable to be there for her when she needs me most. I\u2019ve been having the same conversations with my mom that many other sons and daughters have had with their aging, sometimes stubborn parents: \u201cMake sure your home health aides wear masks and wash their hands, and make sure they don\u2019t touch you.\u201d But how can I be certain my mother will do anything I ask her to do from in here?"], "authors": ["John J.
