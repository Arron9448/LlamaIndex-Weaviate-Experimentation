Well, maybe I should clarify. I\u2019ve attempted to tackle resolutions over the years, but I rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 have stuck with them. My resolutions have either been too broad (\u201cBe a better person\u201d), too unrealistic (\u201cWrite a book, even though you don\u2019t have any ideas for a book or any driving interest in writing a book\u201d), or literally impossible (\u201cStop swearing so often\u201d). This year, I\u2019m going to give it another try, and I think I\u2019ve found a sneaky path to success: I\u2019m tying it into one of my favorite hobbies. How could I fail, right?", "More specifically, I\u2019m going to try and make an effort to broaden my horizons in 2020. When I\u2019m playing games on my own time, I tend to gravitate toward open-world, sandbox-style titles. I\u2019m not going to stop playing those (resolutions shouldn\u2019t be punishment, right?), but I\u2019m going to try to branch out and explore some genres that I don\u2019t play as often as I may have used to. I see two fairly obvious targets.", "First, I\u2019m going to try to play through a new-release JRPG. That\u2019s a genre that I used to love back in the SNES/early PlayStation days, but haven\u2019t been particularly enthusiastic about in more recent years. I liked Blue Dragon quite a bit, and it was probably the last one that really grabbed my attention. I played Persona 5 for about 10 hours, but I stopped playing it because I think I had to review something and I never got back to it. So yeah. That\u2019s my first goal. Play through a JRPG. Credits and all.", "Next, I\u2019d like to tackle something that I\u2019ve never really gelled with. Kyle and I used to bond over our general dislike for grid-based combat. There are certainly exceptions \u2013 he loved South Park: The Fractured, But Whole, and I really liked the XCOM reboot \u2013 but my interest almost always comes to a screeching halt when combat starts and characters eagerly await my commands. In 2020, I\u2019m going to try and play something new with that form of combat.", "You know, now that I look at these two resolutions, I realize that I probably should have played Fire Emblem: Three Houses in 2019. Dammit.", "Anyway, enough about me and my resolutions. Do you have anything you want to try out in 2020? Or are there any habits (like accumulating a backlog) that you\u2019d like to curb in the coming year?"], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["try", "2020", "playing", "discussion", "play", "ive", "really", "book", "resolutions", "whats", "gaming", "used", "resolution", "reader", "im", "going"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
