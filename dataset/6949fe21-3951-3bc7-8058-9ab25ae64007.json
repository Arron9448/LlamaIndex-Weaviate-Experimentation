New York City is one of the culinary capitals of the world, with its restaurants amassing 76 Michelin stars. (Although any city dweller can tell you that many of the eateries with the most charm don\u2019t hold significant critical acclaim at all.) So is the human toll: It\u2019s estimated that 1 out of 4 people unemployed in New York State work in the hospitality industry. Although restaurants have only been linked to 1.43 percent of COVID cases from September to November\u201474 percent are traced back to private indoor gatherings\u2014the government can\u2019t control who comes into our living rooms, so shutting down nonessential businesses remains the way it can slow the spread.", "Estimates say that nearly two-thirds of New York restaurants could be out of business by January. So how can you help? A guide, below.", "Order Delivery and Takeout", "This one is simple: Like a restaurant? Order from it. But do so with some conscious caveats. Call the restaurant directly\u2014that way, it doesn\u2019t need to share its profits with the app or online platform you sourced it from. However, if you really don\u2019t want to speak to someone on the phone: ChowNow is a commission-free ordering platform. \u201cKeep ordering. Even small purchases make an impact\u2014cocktails to go, supplements to your weekly grocery list,\u201d Deborah Williamson, founder of James Provisions in Prospect Heights, tells Vogue. \u201cRemember to tip, and more than 15 percent if you can. Sales are down, which means tips are critical, especially on takeaway and delivery.\u201d", "Go Gift Shopping", "Totes. Merchandise. Meal kits. Anything you can, really, from your favorite restaurant\u2019s e-commerce shops. (Some thoughts: a sweatshirt from iconic, family-owned Italian restaurant Emilio\u2019s Batallo; a festive Negroni assortment from Dante, the official best bar in America; or Il Buco\u2019s holiday bundle, which includes its cookbook and a tray from John Derian.)", "Many restaurants, in light of ever-fluctuating restrictions, have also launched commerce side hustles. Williamson, for example, now sells produce and wellness boxes as well as bar cart essentials. Over in Manhattan, Cote sells ready-to-grill meats and recently launched a wine club.", "Not in New York but missing New York? Go to Goldbelly. It has a whole section on New York food gifts\u2014a dumpling pack from Nom Wah Tea Parlor, smoked salmon from Russ & Daughters, wood-fired pizza from Roberta\u2019s, a burger kit from Raoul\u2019s\u2014that can all ship nationwide.", "Spread the Word on Social Media", "Social media, for all its faults, is good for one thing: spreading the word. Have dinner at a great outdoor dining setup? Tag the eatery, and maybe a follower or two will be inspired to make a reservation themselves. Donate to ROAR (Relief Opportunities for All Restaurants) and post the receipt on your story: Studies show that people are more likely to give money to a specific charity if encouraged by a family or friend. Says Williamson: \u201cSpread the word about the places you love. Post on social, always tag, tell your friends, keep the narrative going. DM restaurants directly to say hello or offer encouragement. We need it now more than ever.\u201d", "Keep Outdoor Dining", "We know it\u2019s cold. But that\u2019s what hats, gloves, and heat lamps are for. \u201cBundle up and venture to your neighborhood spots this winter. Restaurants are doing (and spending) everything they can to make their outdoor setup as innovative and cozy as possible,\u201d says Williamson.", "Contact Your Representative", "While, yes, every little bit helps, let\u2019s be realistic here: You can\u2019t save every neighborhood haunt you love with takeout and to-go cocktails. In New York City alone, there were 23,650 restaurants as of 2019. They provided 317,800 jobs\u201460 percent of which were held by immigrants."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["winter", "toll", "york", "way", "help", "restaurants", "outdoor", "williamson", "word", "ways", "city", "restaurant", "tell"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
