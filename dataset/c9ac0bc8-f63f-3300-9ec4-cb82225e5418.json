The idea is that when your foot sinks into the bead chambers, the beads compress to absorb shock and expand to provide a springy feeling when you run. Nike\u2019s website also said the system creates a footbed that forms to your foot so it feels personalized.", "Although some online reviews complained about the high price for a running shoe, others gushed over the comfortability and how it felt like they were walking on air.", "2.

XEN BY NEUVANA", "Give the gift of relaxation with Xen, a new device designed to deliver multiple wellness benefits through ear-based vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).", "Xen works by using earbuds that send a gentle electrical signal to a vagus nerve catalyst located in the ear. When the vagus nerve is stimulated, it activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which supports a calm and positive mood.", "The Xen device can be paired with a music streaming app or library so users can listen to their favorite tunes or ambient sounds while Xen subtly sends electrical waveforms through your ear and to the vagus nerve.", "The company website says the benefits of VNS can include better sleep, less stress, more tranquility, enhanced focus, a brighter mood and even reduced cravings.", "Neuvana recommends two 15- to 20-minute daily sessions in order for users to feel the effects of VNS in one to two weeks.", "4.

The Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell can go from 8 to 40 pounds with a simple turn of a dial on the device, so instead of storing six different weights at home, users can work out with settings at 12, 20, 25, 35, and 40 pounds.", "This adjustable fitness tool also comes with access to 24 trainer-led exercises on Bowflex\u2019s YouTube channel and a two-year warranty.", "5- SKULLCANDY VERT CLIP-ANYWHERE WIRELESS EARBUDS", "Skullcandy released new wireless earbuds called Vert, which targets users who want to enjoy some tunes while outside exploring.", "The semi-wireless earbuds are tethered to an oversized and glove-friendly control module that gives users access to their tunes, calls, and voice assistant. The larger than usual control station was created specifically with sport enthusiasts in mind. The dial can clip to a goggle or helmet strap and features an extra-large button to pause and play songs along with a moveable edge to adjust volume or change tracks.", "Vert was also created with a \"stay-aware\u201d design that allows some outside noises in so users can be cognizant of their surroundings and hear if another rider is coming up behind or around them on a trail.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "The sweat- and water-resistant buds are said to last around 10 hours on a full charge.", "As an extra bonus, if you should ever lose your Vert earbuds on a hike or on the slopes, you can use the included tile tracker function to see its last known location through an app."], "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/5-holiday-gifts-health-fitness-gurus", "authors": ["Lindsay Carlton", "Lindsay Carlton Is A Senior Video Producer", "Writer For Fox Digital Originals.
