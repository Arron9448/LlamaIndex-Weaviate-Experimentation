Never more so than this January, when the normal delight I feel at settling in to some much needed hibernation time has metamorphosed into a yearning to spend more time with friends. So, perhaps gather a gaggle together online and cook this plant-based delight on the same night, or just at home, for those closest around you.", "Celeriac \u201cmaltagliati\u201d with winter romesco sauce", "Throw in broken lasagne sheets for bulk if you wish, otherwise just revel in the silky celeriac sheets enveloped in the smoky, nutty, richly flavoured romesco.", "Prep 15 min", "Cook 1 hr", "Serves 4", "Olive oil", "1 large Spanish onion, peeled and finely sliced", "4 garlic cloves, peeled; 3 finely sliced, 1 crushed", "1-2 red chillies, finely chopped (to taste)", "1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes, drained and rinsed", "2 large red peppers from a jar, roughly chopped", "50g dried breadcrumbs", "40g hazelnuts, preferably toasted, plus more for sprinkling", "2 tsp sweet smoked paprika", "2\u00bd tbsp sherry vinegar", "1 head celeriac, peeled (to get 1kg \u2018pasta\u2019)", "Pecorino, sheep or goat\u2019s cheese, to serve (optional)", "Put a casserole over a medium heat and add two tablespoons of oil, the onion, sliced garlic, half the chilli and several pinches of salt.
