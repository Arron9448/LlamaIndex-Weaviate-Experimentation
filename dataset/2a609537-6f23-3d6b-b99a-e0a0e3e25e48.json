Derrick Adams. Style Variation 37 (detail), 2020. 96 x 59 3/4 in. Courtesy of the artist and Salon 94, New York. \u00a9 Derrick Adams", "Ideas pour from Derrick Adams, and what\u2019s surprising is how many of them work out. A couple of years ago, around the time that he was making his Floater paintings, depicting Black people lounging on swimming-pool inflatables, he thought, Why not start a creative persons\u2019 retreat where the only obligation would be to appreciate leisure? His eight-bedroom retreat opens next year in Baltimore, his hometown. Struck by The Green Book, the guide compiled by postal worker Victor Hugo Green beginning in 1936 to help Black travelers find safe amenities, Derrick initiated Sanctuary, a series of exhibitions located in and inspired by the cities covered by the guide. He wanted to emphasize the accomplishment of the book, not the racism that made it necessary.", "Adams, 51, a genial, laid-back dynamo whose multidisciplinary art practice spans painting, sculpture, collage, sound installations, video, performance, and fashion, gained widespread acclaim with \u201cLive and in Color,\u201d his 2014 show at New York\u2019s Tilton Gallery. The show recycled images from early sitcoms, game shows, and dramas in collages that were placed in what looked like a vintage television set. The Floater series came next, more than 100 works of Black subjects relaxing on inflatable swans, unicorns, and other fantasy fauna. \u201cI wanted to occupy a different space from all the artists who were speaking on issues of race and trauma and oppression,\u201d Adams says in a Zoom conversation last month. He\u2019s in his Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, studio, a 2,500-square-foot former auto-body shop; I\u2019m in Rhode Island. \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t exist if they lived in constant grief. My work is focused on the idea of how crucial it is for Black people to think of leisure as a radical act.\u201d The matchless independent curator Francesco Bonami, who has worked on projects with Adams, tells me, \u201cHe addresses important and tragic issues without preaching, but at the same time he serves guilt to the white viewer as an appetizer on a designer plate.\u201d", "\u201cPeople couldn\u2019t exist if they lived in constant grief.\"", "This month, Adams\u2019s \u201cStyle Variations\u201d is one of two opening exhibitions at Salon 94\u2019s palatial new venue on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Adams, says Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn, Salon 94\u2019s founder, is \u201cthe right vantage point from which to start a new venture, post-COVID, new administration.\u201d Ten of his magisterial Beauty World paintings dominate the main gallery: larger-than-life mannequin heads, transformed by sculpture-like wigs and evocative makeup. Blocks of color combine with semiabstract forms that channel Cubist painting and African sculpture.", "That, of course, is not all Adams is doing. He is also working on a show for the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, inspired by Patrick Kelly, the young Black fashion designer who died in 1990. The latest version of Sanctuary, his Green Book work, opened in February at the Momentary, a contemporary arm of Crystal Bridges in Bentonville, Arkansas. And he\u2019s been collaborating with Dave Guy, trumpeter for the Roots, on a series of short films. \u201cFor Black men, joy isn\u2019t at the forefront,\u201d Guy tells me, \u201cbut Derrick brings it to his art and daily life. Who else could make a black unicorn look so cool? Only Derrick can, because he is one.\u201d Adams may be the hardest-working leisure lover on earth."], "authors": ["Dodie Kazanjian", "Dodie Kazanjia"], "keywords": ["black", "salon", "art", "exultant", "series", "life", "leisure", "gallery", "celebrates", "adamss", "derrick", "adams", "work", "style", "green"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
