Bloomberg is now demanding a return on his investment \u2013 in the form of a broad ban on commonly owned firearms, gun registration, and outright gun confiscations.", "None of these measures would do anything to make Americans safer or curb violent crime. That is why the National Rifle Association opposes these measures.", "PATRICE ONWUKA: WOMEN'S MARCH SHOULD SUPPORT ALL WOMEN \u2014 NOT JUST OPPOSE ONE MAN", "Bloomberg\u2019s ally in this effort is Gov. Ralph Northam \u2014 yes, THAT politician caught in the blackface scandal. Northam is pushing every single one of Bloomberg\u2019s gun control schemes, including bans. One measure he supports would ban law-abiding citizens from owning America\u2019s most popular all-purpose rifle, the AR-15. Virginians will soon have to turn in those firearms to the state, register them or face confiscation. We\u2019re talking about a rifle that is owned by an estimated 17 million Americans and used for a variety of lawful purposes, including self-defense.", "Here are some facts. FBI data shows that four times as many individuals are killed with knives than with rifles of any kind. Data also shows that rifles were used in fewer homicides than blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.) or personal weapons such as hands, fists and feet.", "In addition, a federal ban on so-called assault weapons shows that it didn\u2019t curb crime. A 1997 Department of Justice-funded study of the Clinton gun ban found, \u201cAt best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders.\u201d A follow-up study, also funded by the Justice Department, determined that \u201cthe ban\u2019s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.\u201d", "Presented with the overwhelming evidence of the ban\u2019s inefficacy, Congress did not renew it. More recently, in 2018 a RAND Corporation study found no conclusive evidence that such bans have an effect on mass shootings or violent crime. Yet, Northam and Bloomberg want it.", "Instead of seeking to punish law-abiding Americans for the acts of violent criminals, lawmakers should focus on expanding opportunities for honest, hard-working Americans to defend themselves.", "Another Northam-backed measure \u2013 so-called universal background checks \u2013 would force law-abiding gun owners to pay government fees and comply with additional mandates simply to share a shotgun with a buddy on a hunting trip or lend a handgun to a friend in crisis who may need to borrow it to defend against someone who is threatening their life.", "So-called universal background checks won\u2019t keep guns out of the hands of criminals because criminals don\u2019t comply with the law. According to the Justice Department, 75 percent of criminals in state and federal prison who had possessed a firearm during their offense acquired it through theft, the black market or through a criminal associate. Researchers at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the UC Davis School of Medicine found that \u201ccomprehensive background checks \u2026 were not associated with changes in firearm suicide or homicide.\u201d", "Bloomberg claims that \u201c92 percent of Americans\u201d support criminalizing private firearms transfers. That\u2019s 100 percent bogus. When citizens have voted on the issue \u2013 it\u2019s either been rejected or voted into law with slim majorities. Washington State\u2019s 2014 ballot initiative was approved by only 59 percent of the voters. Two years later, a majority of the voters in Maine rejected a background check measure. While in Nevada, a similar measure passed with the thinnest of margins, just 50.5 percent of the vote.", "Instead of seeking to punish law-abiding Americans for the acts of violent criminals, lawmakers should focus on expanding opportunities for honest, hard-working Americans to defend themselves.
