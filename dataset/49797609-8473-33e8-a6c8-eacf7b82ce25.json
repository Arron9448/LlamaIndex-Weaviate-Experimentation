But I\u2019ve never noticed it.\u201d It\u2019s only been around for a few years. But you\u2019re probably as sick of it as we are. Well, the thing is, fake news is actually really old. It\u2019s just that, once, it went by a very different name. [ding] [non-English speech] Because really, this story is about a virus, a virus created decades ago by a government to slowly and methodically destroy its enemies \u2014 [water sloshing] \u2014 from the inside. But it\u2019s not a biological virus. It\u2019s more like a political one. And chances are, you\u2019ve already been infected. [music] If you don\u2019t know who to trust anymore, this might be the thing that\u2019s making you feel that way. If you feel exhausted by the news, this could be why. And if you\u2019re sick of it all and you just want to stop caring, then we really need to talk. Ready? [music] O.K., so to start, let\u2019s go back to July, 1983 and all the way over here: New Delhi, India. This is when a remarkable story appears in a newspaper called \u201cThe Patriot.\u201d It claims the H.I.V. virus was secretly created by U.S. government scientists as a weapon to kill African-Americans and gay people. It even names a facility, Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the virus was supposed to have been concocted. It\u2019s a crazy allegation printed in a small newspaper \u2014 no big deal, right? But fast forward just a couple of years, and look what\u2019s happening. The story is spreading all over Africa. The scientific report\u2019s even published by two East German biologists who say they can prove AIDS is made in the U.S.A. All these articles are from just a few months at the end of 1986. And then, somehow, it ends up here. [drums beating] \u201cA Soviet military publication claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked from a U.S. Army laboratory conducting experiments in biological warfare.\u201d That\u2019s Dan Rather reading a fake news story to millions of unwitting Americans on national TV. But don\u2019t be too hard on Dan. This was one of the greatest cons ever carried out on the global scale. And we\u2019re going to show you how it was pulled off. [music] But first, let me introduce you to a few authentic grifters. Stashed away on some old videotapes, we found interviews with a bunch of ex-spies. This guy, Ladislav Bittman. This guy, Stanislav Levchenko, and this guy, Yuri Bezmenov. They all worked for the KGB during the Cold War before defecting to the U.S. And it\u2019s thanks to them that we know so much about one of the KGB\u2019s most secretive departments. \u201cOnly about 15% of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85 percent is a slow process, which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, [speaking Russian] in the language of the KGB.\u201d So \u201cactive measures,\u201d it\u2019s a euphemism for, well, bullshit \u2014 but not just any bullshit, the most strategic, masterful, toxic bullshit you could possibly imagine, made with one goal. \u201cTo change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that, despite of their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.\u201d \u201cWithin the KGB is a department that specializes in planting false stories and forged documents.\u201d We know it was run from Department A right at the top of the KGB. And it had a multimillion-dollar budget. \u201cAt least 15,000 people, who, in the Soviet Union and outside of the Soviet Union, are involved in that kind of actions on a regular, daily basis.\u201d You heard that right \u2014 15,000 people. That\u2019s more than the entire staff at the State Department after 9/11. Now these days, KGB defectors who are still breathing are a little hard to come by. But we tracked down one to a small town in Massachusetts. \u201cWell, my original name was Ladislav Bittman.\u201d These days, he goes by Larry Martin. He\u2019s 87 years old. \u201cIt\u2019s a collage \u2014 \u201c He likes to paint. \u201c \u2014 with Putin. And he was boasting about his riches.\u201d And of course, he has a girlfriend down in Florida. \u201cHello!\u201d \u201cHello, hello. I am still busy.\u201d But back in the day, he was a director at one of the most legendary active measures outposts reporting to Moscow. And when it comes to bullshit, Larry\u2019s done it all. His first ever con \u2014 \u201cIt was an operation to establish a whorehouse in Germany.\u201d That was to catch politicians in compromising situations. And once, he even planted a treasure chest of Nazi papers at the bottom of a lake. \u201cNow original Nazi documents.\u201d That was to stir up anti-German sentiments. Larry\u2019s expertise, though, was a special kind of bullshit, something called \u2014 \u201cDisinformation. Basically, it means deliberately distorted information that is secretly leaked into the communication process in order to deceive and manipulate.\u201d [dinging] All right. Just to avoid any confusion, let\u2019s pause here quickly to unpack all these different flavors of bullshit. Now at the top, you\u2019ve got your active measures, right? These are basically any kind of covert operations against another country short of starting a war. This includes forgeries and even kidnappings. But disinformation was the heart and soul of it for the KGB. You might be thinking, that\u2019s just a fancy word for propaganda. But it\u2019s not. Propaganda tries to convince us to believe something. Disinformation is a highly organized attempt to deceive us into believing it. Today, everyone calls this fake news. But that\u2019s become such a loaded term \u2014 no thanks to this guy \u2014 that it\u2019s basically useless. Anyway, we\u2019ll get on to him later. All right, [dinging] let\u2019s get back to it. Disinformation \u2014 it was such a big deal that every KGB agent was required to spend 25 percent of their time coming up with ideas for false stories. And in a year-end review \u2014 yes, KGB agents had year-end reviews, too \u2014 every agent was evaluated on \u2014 \u201cHow many proposals for disinformation operations he submitted.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten to be fairly good at this when you were Czech intelligence, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, I have to admit, yes.\u201d Just how good were these guys? Well, that rumor that the C.I.A. shot J.F.K., the story about how the C.I.A. tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II, and the one about rich Americans buying poor kids from Latin America to harvest their organs \u2014 but as the first cases of AIDS spread fear around the world, the KGB saw an opportunity for their biggest con yet. [clicking] All right, so let\u2019s go back to 1983. And we\u2019re going to show you what really happened here. So remember this story started with an article in The Patriot newspaper? \u201c\u2018AIDS, the deadly mysterious disease which has caused havoc in the U.S. is believed to be the result of the Pentagon\u2019s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons.\u2019 There\u2019s the crux of the crap.\u201d It\u2019s time you met Kathleen Bailey and Todd Leventhal. They were part of a U.S. government team that first pieced this story together back in the \u201980s. [ding] \u201cThis is just the perfect example of a very effective disinformation campaign.\u201d Well, almost perfect. There are some obvious grammar mistakes here, which tip off experts like Kathleen. Like, in English we\u2019d say flu virus, not the virus flu. \u201cSo it\u2019s written by a non-native English speaker. And it probably was written by a Russian-language speaker.\u201d \u201cThey said, oh, the Indian newspaper, The Patriot \u2014 which we knew the KGB used this as an English language newspaper as a way to get stories out.\u201d This was a classic Soviet tactic. Oleg Kalugin is another ex-KGB agent we found. He told us, they\u2019d always try and place the story \u2014 \u201c \u2014 in a third-world country \u2014 \u201d \u2014 somewhere like \u2014 \u201c \u2014 say, in India, Thailand \u2014 \u201d \u2014 where journalists could be easily tricked or bribed. \u201cSo that gave the story acceptability when nobody was searching about the origin.\u201d [music] The KGB let this story go quiet for a couple of years after India. But with AIDS still making scary headlines in \u201985, they revived it, this time in a prominent Moscow newspaper. And the source for this story? You guessed it. [ding] It\u2019s brilliant, really. They\u2019ve repeated the story but concealed their hand, distancing themselves from the lie they started. So we\u2019re now into 1986. And the KGB want to add gravitas to this lie. So they look around for a scientist, a human face, someone who could back up the lie with data. And no joke \u2014 this is the dude they found. This is Dr. Jakob Segal. Remember I said the reports had two authors? Well, here comes the co-author now. It\u2019s his wife, Lilli. Believe it or not, these two wrote that report that claim to have evidence AIDS was created in a U.S. government lab. \u201cThis scientific gobbledygook \u2014 and you know, read this stuff, and who can understand it? But it purports to be proof.\u201d The thing is, it worked. The KGB made sure the Segal report was read by journalists all over Africa. And they kept on pushing it until it went, well, viral. [ding] It\u2019s appeared in 200 reports in 80 countries. Even The Daily Express in London runs with it. And finally, on March 30, 1987, the KGB hits the jackpot. \u201cA Soviet military publication [echoing] claims the virus that causes AIDS leaked.\u201d This campaign had a KGB code name. They called it, Operation Infection. \u201cGood afternoon. I would like to begin the introduction to this report by stating that the U.S. image abroad is damaged. And U.S. foreign policy is complicated by disinformation. Wow. Huh. That\u2019s a half a lifetime ago. This was handed out at a demonstration. I was so angry that they accused the United States of creating the AIDS virus, because I knew how effective that was going to be as a tool against us. And it angered me deeply. And it empowered me. It motivated me. It fired me up. I was pissed.\u201d [music] Operation Infection, one of the most audacious and successful fake news stories ever created \u2014 and for America, the impact was toxic. \u201cForeign governments actually believed that the U.S. was creating this biological warfare agent. For them to think that damages their view of the United States not only as a culture, but it taints all of our policies. It\u2019s in the back of their minds every time they discuss anything with us.\u201d Now with so much at stake, you might be wondering what the U.S. response to this was. Well, you\u2019re watching it. \u201cThe primary origin of disinformation about the United States abroad is the Soviet Union.\u201d Kathleen and Todd were both part of something called the Active Measures Working Group. Nicknamed Truth Squads, it was a team that tracked and tried to expose Soviet disinformation. \u201cEverybody was working part time on the issue.\u201d \u201cIt was not funded lavishly.\u201d \u201cWe all sat around a table once every week or two. And those who could volunteer their time to come in did.\u201d Yup, that\u2019s right. In the face of thousands of KGB agents with a multimillion-dollar budget, we had some part-time workers propping up poster boards on C-SPAN. \u201cI see that it wasn\u2019t very well attended. And I remember that now that I see this. But it did have an impact.\u201d They didn\u2019t have the budget or the time. But they were motivated by truth and did what they could, responding to the fire hose of falsehoods, calling them out, one lie at a time. \u201cSo they were working at this day, after day, after day. I think we were kept busy just knocking these things down.\u201d But repeated exposure didn\u2019t just lead to a couple of article corrections. Kathleen\u2019s report exposing and debunking Operation Infection made its way right to the top of the Kremlin into the hands of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev himself. Secretary of State George Shultz was in the room when Gorby read it. \u201cAnd you\u2019re spreading all this bum dope about AIDS and the United States pushing it. And I said, come on. So we had a good, heated exchange. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d And days later, Gorbachev did the unthinkable. He bowed to pressure, apologized to President Ronald Reagan, and promised to stop spreading the fake AIDS story. \u201cWhen we in the Active Measures Working Group heard about Gorbachev having read the reports \u2014 that\u2019s cool. That is really cool. He couldn\u2019t deny what we put in the report. And he didn\u2019t deny it.\u201d \u201cYet, it was the military who prevented the hard-line coup from succeeding.\u201d \u201cAnd then came the year 1989, 1990, when the Communist regime collapsed. Nobody believed that the Russians would continue using this weapon in future.\u201d \u201cOur government\u2019s view was, problem solved.\u201d As the Soviet Union was collapsing, Todd wrote this final report for Congress, a warning that would fall on deaf ears. \u201cThe formidable Soviet active measures and disinformation apparatus, which has manipulated world opinion for decades, has disintegrated. But many large fragments of their apparatus continue to exist and function, for the most part now under Russian, rather than Soviet sponsorship.\u201d Don\u2019t forget. KGB agents spent 25% of their time creating disinformation. And that was true of the entire agency during the Cold War, including a young agent from St. Petersburg who enrolled into the KGB in 1975 and who would one day go on to greater things.
