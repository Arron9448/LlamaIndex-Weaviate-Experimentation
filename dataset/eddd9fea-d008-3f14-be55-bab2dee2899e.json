It won't be the first time he's tried to make the world-first ascent. As Magar puts it, he has climbed more than one Everest just to get to this point. But 2020 might finally be the year that he realizes his dream.", "'What about me climbing that mountain?'", "Magar (second left) with his family as a child in Nepal. As a boy he lived in Mirul, Ropla district, later joining the British military aged 19. Hari Budha Magar", "Magar grew up in a village in western Nepal, far from Everest. He would walk to school barefoot, and read about Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's first summit in 1953 in his textbooks.", "\"I used to think 'What about me climbing that mountain?'\" he recalls. Everest was for the privileged, however, and he was not.", "He joined the military aged 19 and passed the rigorous selection process for the elite Royal Gurkha Rifles, part of a brigade composed of Nepalese soldiers which has served in the British Army for over 200 years. Magar served across five continents in roles including sniper, covert surveillance and team medic. Then in 2010 an improvised explosive device detonated when he was on patrol in Afghanistan. \"My life changed like that,\" he says, snapping his fingers.", "As a soldier Magar traveled to five continents (pictured: supporting SAS selection in Brunei in 2008). Hari Budha Magar", "He was rescued by American soldiers and underwent two operations at Bagram Air Base before being flown to the UK for further treatment. Four years after sustaining his injuries, he was discharged from the military with the rank of corporal. He was 35.", "\"After my injury I just didn't know where to start life,\" he says. \"To be honest I struggled, because I couldn't go to the toilet myself, I couldn't eat (by) myself or wash myself initially.\"", "Magar built himself back up \"one step at a time,\" regaining his independence. He took up sports -- lots of them -- as part of his rehabilitation. In 2011 on a ski trip in the German and Austrian Alps he turned to his instructors and broached the idea of climbing mountains. They said they would help.", "Magar rock climbing during his expedition in 2017 in which he climbed Mera Peak (6,476 meters). courtesy HST Adventure", "He traveled to Nepal with an able-bodied fellow Ghurka and montaineer, Krishna, and climbed to 4,700 meters. \"Yeah, this is possible,\" Magar thought, and the idea of Everest came into focus. Ahead of a summit attempt, Magar and a team climbed Mera Peak in Nepal in 2017, reaching 6,476 meters. But before he could take on Everest, in January 2018 the Nepalese government banned amputees and blind people from obtaining climbing permits, as part of new guidelines implemented in a bid to reduce accidents and climbing-related deaths.", "The ban was appealed, and Nepal's Supreme Court overturned the government's decision in March 2018 . Magar's climbing window had passed however, meaning it was back to the drawing board for him and his team.", "Now, nearly two years later, plans are ramping up once more.", "'It is better to die than be a coward'", "In 2017 Magar summited Mera Peak in Nepal as part of his Everest training.

Double amputee Xia Boyu from China also scaled Everest in May 2018 (his fifth attempt) As Inglis and Xia are both below knee amputees, Magar would become the first double above knee amputee to attempt the climb.", "\"Above knee and below knee is a huge difference,\" he explains. \"Having a knee is so advantageous. You can lift your leg up and down. But (without a knee) you're like a penguin.\"", "Today he's wearing prostheses which replicate the length of a lower leg, with a foot and a hinge acting as a knee. But when he's climbing he wears \"stubbies,\" a foreshortened prosthetic with plates at the base -- plates that can be customized to feature crampons.", "Inglis incurred frostbite and impact damage on his stumps during his climb, requiring surgery. He has been advising Magar on how to avoid injury, with possible technology including carbon fibre sockets with heating and insulation options. \"Stump frostbite is a real challenge for Hari,\" he explained via email. \"I was in -50 (Celsius) knee-deep powder near the summit -- that will equate to waist deep for Hari.\"", "\"Every little thing helps above 8,000m,\" Inglis adds, \"the line between a good idea, a great idea, a bad idea and a life-saving idea is very fine.\"", "Even with innovations, there's no getting around the sheer effort of the climb. In August Magar scaled Mont Blanc with amputee Justin Davis as part of his training. On summit day he toiled for 23 hours, he says, \"crawling pretty much 90-95%.\"", "Ladder training in Nepal. Magar says the climb team is exploring climbing from the Tibetan side of the mountain where there are fewer crevasses to cross.
