He had spent twenty years working on the harbor, primarily in environmental education and shipbuilding, and had a deep knowledge of its hydrodynamics and history. City officials, he told me, \u201csaid they were open to ideas, so I started sketching.\u201d He drew plans for a machine powered by an old-fashioned water wheel\u2014a technology that had once been a staple throughout the city\u2014designed to intercept trash at the mouth of Jones Falls, which is the main source of harbor pollution. A prototype was installed in 2008. By 2014, Kellett\u2019s invention was reborn as Mr. Trash Wheel\u2014a fifty-foot-long machine, weighing nearly a hundred thousand pounds, that resembles a friendly mollusk, with giant, googly eyes and its own Twitter account.", "Five years later, Mr. Trash Wheel has spawned three replicas around Baltimore\u2014Professor Trash Wheel, Captain Trash Wheel, and another that was announced last week but has yet to be named or installed in the water. Three local beers are named in their honor, and the city has both a trash-wheel fan festival and a society dedicated to promoting environmental awareness known as the Order of the Wheel. As plastic pollution in the world\u2019s oceans has become a growing crisis, the trash wheels have gained an international following. \u201cOver the last few years, I\u2019ve been getting calls and e-mails from all over the world,\u201d Kellett said. A Japanese film crew visited last week. \u201cI\u2019m still kind of in shock about how much attention it has garnered,\u201d he went on. \u201cNever in my wildest dreams would I ever have thought that this idea I sketched on a napkin would lead to all this.\u201d", "Watching Mr. Trash Wheel in action is almost hypnotic. Two booms extend from its body, guiding trash flowing from the tributary toward its mouth, where a conveyor belt slowly carries the trash up a ramp and deposits it in a dumpster, located under a canopy. An automated rake helps the trash up the ramp. (Kellett grew up on a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and had hay balers in mind when he was designing the prototype.) When the dumpster is full, a boat takes it to a truck that transports it to be emptied in a nearby incineration facility; the burned trash is used to make electricity for Maryland homes. (The hope is that, eventually, it will be sorted and recycled.) To date, Mr. Trash Wheel has collected approximately twelve hundred and thirty-three tons of trash and debris\u2014mostly plastic bags and bottles, cigarette butts, and foam containers, but also a guitar, a keg, and a living ball python.", "According to a landmark paper published in 2015 by the eminent solid-waste scientist Jenna Jambeck, roughly eight million metric tons of plastic travelled from land into the world\u2019s oceans each year, mostly down rivers. But, when Kellett first conceived Mr. Trash Wheel, in 2007, researchers were only just beginning their efforts to analyze and quantify the problem. That has changed over the past several years. While researchers and activists have since prioritized the prevention of plastic pollution in the first place\u2014through legislation and regional bans, new materials, and corporate accountability, among other initiatives\u2014clean-up measures, particularly in rivers, are a necessary part of the picture. Plans to install versions of Kellett\u2019s trash wheels are currently in development in Newport Beach, California; Brunswick, Georgia; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Panama City, Panama. \u201cI don\u2019t think of the Trash Wheel as a solution,\u201d Kellett said. \u201cWe are treating a symptom of the disease. It\u2019s not a cure.\u201d", "On October 26th, the Ocean Cleanup, the six-year-old Dutch technology nonprofit, unveiled a new machine, very similar to Mr. Trash Wheel, in a theatrical production on the Rotterdam waterfront. Before the big reveal, Boyan Slat, the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s twenty-five-year-old founder and the event\u2019s master of ceremonies, gave a nod to Mr. Trash Wheel, flashing a picture of it on the screen behind him. \u201cThis is amazing, pioneering work, and they actually do the job really well in their specific locations. But this is a global problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is a product\u2014one integrated system that you can bring anywhere in the world, install within days\u2014that just works.\u201d He went on, \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to close the tap, and it doesn\u2019t exist. Until today.\u201d", "The amphitheatre went dark, strobe lights flashed, electronic music blared, and the screen lifted, revealing the machine: the Interceptor. Seventy-five feet long, twenty-six feet wide, and sixteen feet tall, it is made primarily from stainless steel, aluminum, and a bit of recycled ocean plastic. It vaguely resembles a luxury yacht with the bridge chopped off. Solar panels, which line the top deck, provide all of its power. Like Mr. Trash Wheel, the Interceptor uses a boom, which the Ocean Cleanup calls a barrier, to guide trash flowing downriver to its mouth, where a conveyor belt catches it. It then uses an automated shuttle to drop the trash into one of six dumpsters. Slat put on a little black life jacket and went down to a ramp to give a tour and a demonstration. (Instead of trash, the display used yellow plastic ducks sporting blue Ocean Cleanup hats). He noted that, according to the firm\u2019s research, forthcoming in a scientific journal, a thousand rivers around the world (out of about a hundred thousand total) are responsible for roughly eighty per cent of the plastic inflow into oceans. He plans to deploy the machine at the mouths of each of them in the next five years.", "The Ocean Cleanup is known for its efforts to build a contraption that uses natural forces\u2014wind and waves\u2014to clean plastic from the high seas. Its first prototype, launched in 2018 in the North Pacific gyre, where ocean-plastic concentrations are highest, failed spectacularly; it was unable to retain the plastic it gathered, and then it broke into two pieces. (In early October, the group announced that its latest iteration was functioning.) However, Slat and his team had been simultaneously focussed on the company\u2019s river-mouth technology. They started developing the Interceptor four years ago, thanks to earmarked grants from a Dutch foundation. But they kept it quiet. \u201cIt allowed the team to really focus on getting it to work first,\u201d Slat told me. \u201cIt\u2019s never really fun to be in the public spotlight.\u201d", "In February, Ocean Cleanup installed its first prototype in Indonesia; in August, it unveiled the second, in Malaysia. A third is about to be launched, in Vietnam, and a fourth\u2014the machine that Slat showcased in Rotterdam\u2014will soon be on its way to the Dominican Republic. Thailand and Los Angeles County have also signed on to install Interceptors. \u201cThe fact that it is still relevant to deploy in advanced economies, like the United States, shows that this is not meant as a replacement for good waste infrastructure, or any other prevention activity,\u201d Slat told the Rotterdam crowd. \u201cThis is an extra safety net, a supplement, if all else fails.\u201d", "The Ocean Cleanup has reported that it can collect about a hundred and ten-thousand pounds of trash a day. According to Slat, the Interceptor builds on everything that came before, including Mr. Trash Wheel. The main difference is that the Interceptor, Slat said, \u201chas really been designed for series production, to be easy to produce rapidly in great volumes,\u201d which will keep costs low. (The first four Interceptors cost seven hundred thousand euros a piece for construction and assembly.) Chris Worp, the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s new managing director, added that the machine is \u201cis built like a tank,\u201d designed to deal with the world\u2019s most heavily polluted rivers. According to the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s research, the river in Malaysia where it deployed an Interceptor can emit more than ten-thousand metric tons of trash and debris annually.", "Jambeck, the solid-waste scientist, is skeptical of Slat\u2019s efforts. Mr. Trash Wheel\u2019s success, she said, has been largely due to the way it engages Baltimore citizens, and how specific it is to its local setting. Some of her recent work involves helping communities along the Ganges, from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, assess the right kind of trash interventions to address the overwhelming pollution problem. With the Interceptor, the Ocean Cleanup could have emphasized that \u201cwhere people are interested in doing this, we can help them implement this kind of thing,\u201d instead of acting like they had come up with an end-all solution, she said. \u201cThere definitely could be positives, but the way it was presented was hard to stomach.\u201d", "Slat acknowledged that the Interceptor\u2019s biggest challenge is not the technology\u2014which, like Mr. Trash Wheel\u2019s, is quite simple\u2014but, rather, people. Building relationships with regional stakeholders\u2014governments, industry, and local communities\u2014to insure that the trash that the Interceptors collect is removed from rivers and disposed of properly \u201cis the biggest bottleneck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t deploy unless there is a solution that satisfies our standards.\u201d Right now, the nonprofit is mainly looking at locations that have a landfill that meets American standards, incineration facilities to produce energy, or, in the best-case scenario, a sorting step so that some of the trash can be recycled. \u201cWe are aiming for best available solution locally,\u201d Slat said. \u201cOr we work with parties to actually set it up\u2014so that\u2019s another potential positive side effect of doing these Interceptors. It may create the opportunity for better waste infrastructure.\u201d", "Mr. Trash Wheel recently had some fun with Slat on Twitter, posting a shaky home video, with a D.I.Y.-strobe-light effect and a caption that reads, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT!\u201d The video shows trash in the trash wheel, and a narrator, in a faux-Slat accent, says, \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful new piece of technology that\u2019s been around for quite some time now. Yep.\u201d (According to Kellett, Slat and the Ocean Cleanup did not speak to him, or any of the people who help operate the Baltimore trash wheels, about their plans before their announcement.) Adam Lindquist, who runs Baltimore\u2019s Healthy Harbor Initiative\u2014which is funded in part by a business-improvement district tax, and which raised the money for the original Mr. Trash Wheel, in 2014\u2014said that the Ocean Cleanup\u2019s announcement was a good sign, as it meant more cities were taking responsibility for cleaning up. \u201cThere is no shortage of plastic in our waterways,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe wish them the best of luck. It is a strikingly similar project. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\u201d"]}
