Sweet orange blossom from Cacharel\u2019s original eau de parfum scented much of her childhood growing up in Queens, and to this day, even a slight whiff of patchouli brings her back to Palo Alto, California, where she used to buy the earthy oil from a local farmers market as a Grateful Dead\u2013loving undergrad at Stanford University.", "Now 39 and in full command of her eponymous four-year-old brand dedicated to frilly, one-off frocks torn from the pages of Laura Ingalls Wilder, Hay is at something of an olfactory impasse. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a strong scent, but it\u2019s been tricky for me to find one that\u2019s exactly right,\u201d she reveals of the impetus behind her new collaboration with the conceptual perfume house R\u00e9gime des Fleurs, which translates Hay\u2019s madcap, more-is-more approach to fashion into a maximalist\u2019s fragrance fever dream.", "\u201cI was surprised that she really likes perfume\u2014and that she likes so many different kinds that are totally unrelated,\u201d admits R\u00e9gime founder and creative director Alia Raza, who, after meeting Hay through friends five years ago, took her on a research trip to the perfume department at Barneys\u2019 now-shuttered Madison Avenue flagship. \u201cIt felt like going into a fabric store and picking swatches,\u201d Hay says of the creative process. But instead of calico prints and vintage gingham, Raza worked with smoky bergamot and a surprising water-lily note for an ethereal, aquatic quality.", "\u201cThere had to be some unpredictable aspect to it,\u201d muses Raza, who purposely shied away from the more obvious fruity floral notes that you might expect from Hay\u2014the woman who has almost single-handedly made \u201ccottage\u00adcore\u201d a mainstay on red carpets and Instagram feeds, helped along by a lengthy list of supportive indie darlings and rock icons. (Courtney Love is a loyal fan.) Instead, the fragrance leans heavily on a leather-laced, heady nostalgia that reminds Hay of draping herself in her mother\u2019s clothes and jewelry as a young girl. Her signature florals have their moment via a limited-edition custom-designed printed-glass flacon that arrives in a keepsake pouch made from a matching cotton fabric. \u201cI love how there\u2019s a romance to Batsheva\u2019s clothes but also a lot of mystery when you wear them because you\u2019re all covered up,\u201d Raza says of Hay\u2019s modest cuts. The look is \u201clayered and complex,\u201d she continues\u2014and now atomized.", "Each perfume can come with a matching pouch, featuring a custom floral pattern designed by Hay.
