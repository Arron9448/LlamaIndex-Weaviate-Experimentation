In the past year, however, the 34-year-old actress has become known for another role, as designer and animal-rights campaigner. In 2018, she co-founded Hiraeth, a Los Angeles-based vegan label, alongside Chrys Wong, a former personal shopper, and Sara Schloat, a childhood friend. Her public appearances, meanwhile, have been a subtle platform on which to showcase her cruelty-free designs.", "Mara\u2019s decision to launch a fashion label was born of her own frustration at not finding animal-friendly clothes. Vegan for the past eight years (her fianc\u00e9, the actor Joaquin Phoenix, has been plant-based since the age of three), Mara found herself among a growing tribe of consumers seeking conscious choices but finding nowhere to go. Mainly she wanted vegan combat boots, which were near impossible to find \u2013 or produce, it later transpired \u2013 but which can now be purchased for $650 from the Hiraeth site. Despite the early focus on shoes, things soon \u201csnowballed\u201d into ready-to-wear. Today, they offer two collections a year, everything is manufactured in Los Angeles by people paid a living wage and they sell both on their own site and worldwide at Dover Street Market. Adrian Joffe, president of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Dover Street Market, says the decision to stock the brand was informed principally by \u201cthe magic and beauty of the clothes\u201d. But, he adds, the brand\u2019s \u201csocially and planetary responsible\u201d standpoint reflects also a growing trend among his customers. \u201cThere is definitely a growing awareness that we should all do whatever we can, in however small a way, to be more responsible for our actions.\u201d", "Advertisement", "Vegetarians, vegans and other flexitarian categories currently account for around 11 per cent of the world population: around three per cent of the US population is vegan. And the numbers are growing. Mounting evidence shows that a plant-based diet can reduce the risk of developing numerous chronic diseases over the course of one\u2019s life. The World Health Organisation classifies red meat as Group 2A, meaning that it is \u201cprobably\u201d carcinogenic to humans; processed meat is classified as Group 1, meaning \u201cthere is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer\u201d. It\u2019s also better for the environment. According to a study by Harvard University, approved in 2013, around 30 per cent of the word\u2019s total ice-free surface is farmed to support the chickens, pigs and cattle that we eat. And livestock production \u2013 which includes meat, milk and eggs \u2013 uses one-third of the world\u2019s fresh water.", "Mara\u2019s conversion to veganism, however, was an ethical choice. \u201cFrom when I was very little, I was obsessed with animals \u2013 and I was always a really picky, bad eater \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t until I was in first grade, aged about 10 or 11, and I met a new friend who was vegetarian that I discovered what being a vegetarian meant. I didn\u2019t even know it was an option \u2013 to choose not to eat something. So, as soon as I met her, I was like, well, I\u2019m vegetarian too. I don\u2019t want to eat animals. And then about seven or eight years ago, someone sent me one of those undercover videos of a pig farm and that led me down this YouTube black hole of horrific videos. And I\u2019ve been vegan ever since.\u201d", "A life of oatmilk lattes is one thing but, as Mara soon realised, her new adopted lifestyle came with other strings attached. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable wearing wool \u2013 and her favourite biker boots and leather jacket were completely verboten. \u201cThat took a minute,\u201d says Mara of the dawning realisation that her dietary choices had sartorial implications. \u201cAnd then it was something that I really grappled with because I love clothes and I didn\u2019t want to get rid of them. But even wearing leather I had already felt kind of hypocritical because I am an ethical vegan \u2013 I do it for the animals. So I decided to transition my whole wardrobe.\u201d", "Then came the fix. \u201cThere were so many things I couldn\u2019t wear any more, but I couldn\u2019t find an alternative,\u201d says Mara. \u201cHiraeth came out of my own necessity.\u201d", "Hiraeth is a Welsh word meaning homesickness for a place that may never have been. It reverberated with Mara because she liked its echo of displacement. \u201cI think we\u2019re in that place right now as a society with every facet of our lives,\u201d she explains. \u201cWho are we? Where are we? Where are we going? We\u2019re all so uncomfortable and trying to figure out where to go next. That word, Hiraeth, just really resonated with me. It was always a feeling I\u2019ve had of being a very romantic, nostalgic person, just always feeling like\u2026 wanting to return to some place that doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d", "That sensibility is felt also in the clothes, which combine girlish, feminine fluted organzas and artisanal vintage-style shirts and dresses with tougher looks in vegan leather in a monochromatic palette. \u201cWe try and have it be a fusion of nostalgic pieces plus more minimalist and modern things,\u201d says Mara of the collection, which she wears when she\u2019s \u201csomeone else\u2019s date\u201d or for public engagements when she\u2019s not wearing Givenchy (with whom she has a pre-existing contract). \u201cCertainly the clothes reflect things that I was always drawn to\u2026 I loved playing dress-up in all my mom\u2019s old nightgowns and stuff, and I love the clothes from the \u201930s and the \u201940s and Victorian clothes, so it\u2019s definitely inspired by those things.\u201d", "In person, over tea at a quiet downtown restaurant at the Ludlow Hotel in New York, Mara appears part gothic heroine, part punk fairy. She radiates an otherworldy kind of beauty - ethereal is the word most often applied. Born in Bedford, New York, in 1985, she had a childhood of extreme affluence \u2013 and sport; her mother\u2019s family (the Rooneys) founded the Pittsburgh Steelers, while her father\u2019s family (the Maras) founded the New York Giants, an NFL dynastic union said to be worth more than $3bn. She and her older sister, Kate, both started acting in their teens, and Rooney has built a powerful career playing soulful, intense, cerebral female characters. In January, she will start work on the new Guillermo del Toro film Nightmare Alley after a three-year absence from a film set. When we meet she has just returned from a week of being \u201ca plus one\u201d to Phoenix at the Venice film festival, promoting Joker. Their relationship is one of the reasons why Mara has now settled in LA.", "As for running a business, Mara insists it\u2019s a group effort. \u201cWe do have roles, but everyone dips their hand in everything,\u201d she says of the team, which remains in single digits and is largely dependent on the \u201camazing talent\u201d of Lily, a former intern and student of London Central Saint Martin\u2019s who turned up with some sketches and now part runs the show. \u201cI would say that Chrys is the glue that holds it all together because she\u2019s the only one of us that has any sort of real experience in the fashion industry,\u201d adds Mara. \u201cAnd Sara does a lot with sales and the business side, which I just have no tolerance for.\u201d", "Advertisement", "Mara is an unlikely entrepreneur. \u201cAll of it,\u201d she says when asked which feature of the business she likes the least. \u201cAny conversation with a lawyer, or anything related to something that\u2019s not a creative\u2026 The maths. I\u2019m just like, do I have to have this? It\u2019s like that in acting, too, when you\u2019re making a deal for a movie. I\u2019m just like, I don\u2019t really care, just do whatever. I\u2019m the worst.\u201d", "She\u2019s reluctant to take much credit for the design either. She\u2019s mortified when it\u2019s suggested that she may have been inspired by the designers Clare Waight Keller or Riccardo Tisci, with whom she has worked in the past. \u201cI can\u2019t even think about myself in terms of them because, like I said, those are real artists. I don\u2019t think of myself in terms of that. But yes, I\u2019ve always bought vintage things and then had them tailored differently so that they would fit me the way I wanted, and I\u2019ve always very easily been able to imagine up dresses that I wanted made. And I\u2019ve always had very specific tastes and know what I like and know what I don\u2019t like. So, yes, that came naturally to me, but I\u2019m not a designer and I don\u2019t think I ever will be. I don\u2019t claim to be.\u201d", "Mara\u2019s view is pretty stoic, but while she\u2019s quick to proselytise about mushrooms (I went to a vegan dinner she hosted in Paris that testified to her commitment to the cause), she\u2019s a very gentle activist. \u201cI know so many people who have gone vegan really suddenly overnight,\u201d she says of the dangers of jumping on the plant-based wagon. \u201cThey\u2019ll see a documentary and they\u2019ll be enraged and try and change their whole life the next day, and it doesn\u2019t last that long because it\u2019s too much change at once. Obviously, I would love for people to change their entire way of doing things overnight. There\u2019s a part of me that wants to shake people and be like, look what you\u2019re a part of, but I know that, even from arguments with people in my family not pertaining to veganism, those kinds of arguments don\u2019t get you anywhere. So I try to be an example as opposed to being a loud voice in their face. And I think it has the potential to get better results, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "She\u2019s quick to point out that her business brings with it other dilemmas as well. Such as the fact that vegan leather is plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d says Mara. \u201cVegan leather is not all that environmentally friendly. But we don\u2019t make that much stuff in the faux and it\u2019s not meant to be fast fashion that you wear a few times and get rid of. And for me, the argument is, no matter what, using real leather is going to be worse for the environment, even if it is a natural fibre, because you still have to keep that animal alive. You need the land in order to keep that animal alive. Then you need more land in order to feed that animal. And water. For me, it\u2019s not really a comparison.\u201d", "Mara didn\u2019t anticipate that she would become so absorbed by Hiraeth. After months of immersion in growth charts and distribution and inventory and talk of investment, she\u2019s relishing the chance to act again. \u201cI\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d she says of her real job. \u201cAs an actor, you go off and you make something and you give it all of your attention and it\u2019s a very intense experience, but it\u2019s three months and so it\u2019s easy to give it 150 per cent and forget about the rest of your life. Hiraeth is also very intense, but it never ends. It just keeps going.\u2026\u201d", "That said, she\u2019s grown to enjoy the power that running a house brings with it. \u201cIt has been really nice having more of a say in things. I love acting, and being at the whim of everyone, especially the director\u2019s vision. And not having to make hard decisions, and letting someone else lead. But, yes, it has been fun to wear a different hat and get to work in a different way.\u201d", "Will we see her take a more political stance in her on-screen work? For Mara, it seems, acting and veganism co-exist independently \u2013 although she no longer wears fur or leather for a role. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s incredible to have a platform to talk about the things that are important to you. It\u2019s an amazing part of what I get to do. And I am a political person. But I don\u2019t want to muddy the two things.\u201d", "Mara doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s saving the planet. The opposite in fact. Her ambitions are modest. \u201cThe most environmental thing would be for all of us to just not buy things,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I struggle with that. But the thing is, people are going to buy things. And we\u2019re such a teeny, tiny thing \u2013 it\u2019s not like we\u2019re making stuff on a massive scale. So why not give them an option that is a little bit more friendly?\u201d Why not indeed? And how typically gentle."], "keywords": ["plantbased", "im", "makes", "actress", "dont", "activist", "shes", "things", "case", "chic", "clothes", "vegan", "really", "mara", "think", "rooney", "leather"], "pubDate": null}
