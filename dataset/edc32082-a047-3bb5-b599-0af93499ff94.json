Kathleen Jen, a 52-year-old mother of two boys (now college-aged) in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, was inspired to pick up karate about a decade ago after taking her sons to classes. On a whim, the head of the dojo began offering daytime courses for parents. Those classes ended, but Ms. Jen was hooked. \u201cYou\u2019re learning something that you\u2019ve been watching for two years,\u201d she said. After the daytime classes ended, she moved to the evening classes alongside her older son, Matthew, then 6 years old. \u201cAt the time he was three belts ahead,\u201d she said.", "While you might think a child would chafe at having his mom or dad in class, she said it worked for largely one reason: \u201cI never corrected him.\u201d Her own father, she said, was her high school team\u2019s soccer coach. \u201cI don\u2019t remember him giving as much feedback as I see parents in our generation give kids \u2014 even if they don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d", "Being a learning model means parents sometimes need to embrace a childlike willingness to learn, which is not always so easy. Susan Darrow, the chief executive of Music Together, a worldwide early music and movement program headquartered in New Jersey, said that getting parents out of their comfort zone can be a challenge. \u201cWhen a parent and a toddler come to a class, we know that the most important teacher for that child is the parent,\u201d she noted. \u201cBut that means the most important student, for us, is the parent.\u201d", "Because the emphasis is on playful, non-formal, experiential learning, she said, the program found a \u201cbackdoor\u201d way to reach parents. \u201cWe give them a powerful reason to be musical, which they don\u2019t realize,\u201d she said. \u201cBy singing and dancing with their child every week, they\u2019re supporting their own musicality.\u201d Many people, she noted, are embarrassed to express themselves musically, especially as beginners. But since they\u2019re doing it for their child, they tend to forget their inhibitions.", "However intuitively positive it might seem to learn something new alongside one\u2019s child, there\u2019s a paucity of research into any possible benefits \u2014 the question drew blanks from several researchers I contacted. Nor is it easy to find programs \u2014 though they do exist \u2014 catering to families learning together.", "There is one approach that, from its inception, posited the parent as a kind of model co-learner: the \u201cSuzuki method,\u201d named for its founder, the Japanese violinist and teacher Shinichi Suzuki. Beth Cantrell, who teaches cello using the method and is the board chair for the Suzuki Association of the Americas, said that a parent learning an instrument alongside their child is not only modeling the act of learning, but \u201cit gives the parent some respect for how difficult the child\u2019s task is.\u201d", "And who knows, maybe it\u2019s something that will stick, for parent and child. Ms. Jen, the Illinois karate mom, went on to become a black belt, like her son. In a nice twist, when she competed a few years ago in a master\u2019s level event, her son was in the audience. After her team won gold, her son asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you just love competing?\u201d She said: \u201cNo, I hate competing. I love the training.\u201d To which he replied: \u201cMom, that\u2019s so backwards.\u201d"], "authors": ["Tom Vanderbilt"], "keywords": ["kid", "parents", "jen", "parent", "learn", "classes", "suzuki", "dont", "mom", "sign", "son", "learning", "child"], "pubDate": "2021-04-20T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
