In late March or early April, the justices will hear a trio of cases\u2014two involving the House of Representatives, one a prosecutor in New York\u2014on subpoenas of Mr Trump\u2019s financial documents from his banks and accounting firm. When the decisions in Trump v Mazars, Trump v Deutsche Bank and Trump v Vance arrive by the end of June, impeachment will be yesterday\u2019s news. But the presidential race could be jolted by the sudden release of his long-suppressed financial details.", "By historical standards, the court is moving quite fast, if not at the pace set when the special prosecutor in the Watergate investigations sought Richard Nixon\u2019s Oval Office tapes in 1974. Then the Supreme Court held a three-hour oral argument 45 days after the appeal was filed, and just 16 days later the justices returned a 9-0 defeat for Nixon and his claim of \u201cabsolute privilege\u201d. Sixteen days after that, the president resigned. This time the records are not directly salient to the impeachment articles. Yet the court has granted all three cases despite not having all the usual briefs in hand and has slotted the hearings into the first open dates on its calendar.", "In one sense, the court\u2019s announcement must be a relief for Mr Trump, buying him some time. Had it declined to review any of the three cases, years of Mr Trump\u2019s tax returns and finances would have been sent at once over to the House committees or Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney. But the move should not reassure the president that he will ultimately prevail. The Supreme Court typically gives presidents a hearing when they ask. But both Nixon and then Bill Clinton suffered resounding losses. When Mr Clinton argued that Paula Jones\u2019s sexual-harassment claim would distract him from his presidential duties, justices in 1997 refused by a unanimous vote to defer her lawsuit until after he left office.", "Those two judgments seem ominous for Mr Trump. In some ways, his circumstances seem even less worthy of judicial solicitude than his predecessors\u2019 were. In contrast to both the Nixon and Clinton cases, the subpoenas do not demand anything at all of Mr Trump\u2014they are directed to third parties. And unlike Mr Clinton, Mr Trump cannot point to anything in the subpoenas that would divert him from his presidential duties. In a further contrast to the earlier precedents, in Vance (though not necessarily in the other two cases) the financial records would be kept secret for grand-jury deliberation in New York\u2014and not made public, at least until Mr Trump leaves office.", "The current cases raise distinct legal questions. Mr Trump\u2019s claim of \u201cabsolute immunity\" from all \u201cjudicial process\u201d in Vance\u2014which included a straight-faced claim that he could shoot someone and escape investigation while president\u2014has scant precedent or reasoning to recommend it. Not a single judge at the district or circuit court voted for it. But as efforts by Democrats in the House of Representatives to secure Mr Trump\u2019s records from Deutsche Bank and Capital One (his banks) and Mazars USA (his accounting firm) have made their way up to the Supreme Court, four judges have dissented from the judgments against Mr Trump.", "The most level-headed demurral came from Debra Ann Livingston, who dissented from a 2-1 decision against Mr Trump at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on December 3rd. Judge Livingston argued that Congress\u2019s power to conduct investigations for the purpose of legislating is \u201cnot unlimited\u201d. Congress may issue subpoenas to gather essential information, but legislators have \u201cno power to expose personal information for the sake of exposure\u201d. The 1958 case setting this limit, Watkins v United States, upheld the rights of individuals during America\u2019s anti-communist panic not to disclose private political beliefs or affiliations. According to Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers, the subpoenas amount to a \u201cdragnet\" worthy of a law-enforcement agency, not Congress.", "Democratic legislators counter that they have legitimate goals in mind. The oversight committee is considering legislation bolstering ethics rules and would benefit from a look at potential conflicts of interest in the president\u2019s taxes and business records. The intelligence and financial-services committees say they need the information to pursue measures guarding against \u201cforeign influence in our systems for electing officials\u201d. The risk that \u201chostile state actors will continue to interfere in the American electoral process\u201d is grave enough for lawmakers to have a look at the finances of Mr Trump and his family members. These concerns, House Democrats tell the justices, ought to outweigh the president\u2019s interest in keeping his books private\u2014especially since every president since Nixon has shared at least some financial records with the American public.", "So it is far from obvious how the justices will rule in these disputes. The five conservative justices generally favour giving presidents considerable leeway and have been keen to bless most of Mr Trump\u2019s questionable exercises of presidential power. In June, though, John Roberts, the chief, sided with the liberal justices in a dispute over Mr Trump\u2019s drive to add a citizenship question to the census. He is focused on protecting the court\u2019s legitimacy and bristles at the idea that it serves as the president\u2019s rubber stamp. The most recent appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, once mused that the case releasing Nixon\u2019s tapes may have been wrongly decided. But at his Senate confirmation hearing in 2018, he praised the decision as \u201cone of the greatest moments in American judicial history\u201d and drew attention to the effort by Warren Burger, chief justice at the time, to bring \u201cthe court together in a unanimous decision\u201d that helped to oust the very man who appointed him to the bench. Mr Trump\u2019s financial-records cases are a profound test of whether Justice Kavanaugh and his colleagues will demonstrate similar independence."], "pubDate": null, "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["follow", "subpoenas", "supreme", "justices", "wades", "mr", "records", "trump", "court", "finances", "house", "battle", "trumps", "money", "donald", "cases", "presidents"], "id": "e7f88a3d-4e39-351d-8ce1-b9fb8c343554", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/12/15/the-supreme-court-wades-into-the-battle-over-donald-trumps-finances"}
