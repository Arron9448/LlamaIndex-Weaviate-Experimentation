The 22-year-old German filmmaker has now wrapped up what has been a years-in-the-making project, a personal snapshot diary of the places and people he\u2019s seen and met over the past five years.", "Paul Herrmann Photographed by Steffen Grap", "While Herrmann\u2019s photos are far-reaching, the skateboarding scene forms a through line in his work. Having grown up in a small town close to Frankfurt, Herrmann credits much of his desire to travel, aesthetics, and connections to skateboarding. \u201cSkateboarding was the door to basically everything I do now. It made me the person I am today. I feel like once you get to a certain level, probably learning the first tricks, you want to record yourself and you want to share it with people,\u201d Herrmann told Vogue. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did.\u201d", "He crossed over to the world of fashion when he was 16 years old, working as a model but continuing to film skateboarding videos all the while. His two interests intersected when the owner of his modeling agency put him on assignment to capture Paris Fashion Week. \u201cShe bought me the camera, and I went out there for a whole week and then edited this little video.\u201d \u201cI was just the guy with the VHS camera that just basically did everything on my own. I edited myself, I filmed it myself. I directed it myself.\u201d Herrmann\u2019s work eventually caught the eye of various fashion houses, including Versace, Fendi, and Prada. \u201cI think what people really liked was the fact that it was so personal. My friends are all skaters, so it was cool to just capture them doing whatever and edit it together. The first jobs I did were literally like this\u2014just going out, having fun, wearing the clothing or the product from the brands, and then editing it all together. It really felt like it was taken out of the moment. Shooting everything on my own on a small camcorder allowed me to be with it anywhere without people really noticing. I was sort of a flower on the wall.", "\u201cMaking this magazine really felt like going back to this. I did everything myself. I shot the pictures, did the layout myself, and even packed and shipped it myself. Every magazine is numbered with a sticker I wrote myself.\u201d", "The bulk of the images in Time Will Tell came from a short film Herrmann shot while visiting the United States in 2018, which he recently rediscovered and decided to develop into a one-off magazine. \u201cI was like, Well, it\u2019s been almost three years. It\u2019s time to pick it up again and finish it because I really loved the layout still. I decided to not only focus on America and more on the trips I did afterward.\u201d", "Below is a short preview of the nearly 70-page project. All photos have been taken by Herrmann using a small Contax T2 point-and-shoot camera.", "\u201cThis was taken somewhere in Los Angeles. After spending most of our day in the car, we ended up skating in this schoolyard. The sun was setting, and I took this picture of my friend Adrian. I miss the California sun.\u201d Photographed by Paul Herrmann", "\u201cThis might be the favorite photo I ever took. I told Adrian about my project and said I was looking for people to participate. He told me that Dominic [pictured] is a great singer and an amazing model. We FaceTimed him right away. I told him about my plan, and he was up for it. He then invited me to his neighborhood and family house. He lived about an hour\u2019s drive from where I was staying. I just hopped on the bus hoping to find him. It might have been like 40 stations away. I didn\u2019t know where I was, nor did I know the person I was about to meet. However, everything went well: He showed me his neighborhood, we chilled at his house, and he showed me his latest songs. To this day I like to think about the uncertainty, and it makes me even more happy about the result. Not only the photo itself but the fact I made a new friend based on trust.\u201d Photographed by Paul Herrmann", "\u201cI love old cars. I love long drives in the sun, down a beautiful road.\u201d Photographed by Paul Herrmann", "\u201cThe left is a photo I took on our last morning in Las Vegas. I was not yet 21 at that point and got basically kicked out of every casino. So after a rather unsuccessful night in Vegas, we went to this driving lot before heading back to L.A. To be honest, I don\u2019t remember taking this photo. Nor do I remember that these two red cars were even there. I guess you can call it luck. The right photo was taken in New York, minutes before some of the boys went back home. After a two-week skate trip, we were all exhausted but happy.\u201d Photographed by Paul Herrmann", "Photographed by Paul Herrmann", "Click here to get a copy of Time Will Tell magazine.
