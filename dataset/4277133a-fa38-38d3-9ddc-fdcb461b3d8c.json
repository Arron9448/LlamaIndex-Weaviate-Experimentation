It is an unusual look for a Japanese politician. As Japan\u2019s new minister of digital reform, his task is to make the stubbornly analogue Japanese government work a bit more like him.", "Japan has some of the world\u2019s best digital infrastructure, with top-notch mobile and broadband networks. Yet interacting with government agencies often involves slogging through labyrinthine offices and leafing through paperwork. In a survey of 30 countries in the OECD , a club mostly of rich countries, Japan ranked last in terms of providing digital services: only 7.3% of citizens requested anything from the government online in 2018, a fraction of Iceland\u2019s 80%, and behind even countries considered relative technological backwaters, such as Slovakia and Mexico.", "Suga Yoshihide, Japan\u2019s prime minister since September, has vowed to \u201cadvance digitisation in government\u201d. He is not the first to make such a promise: an e-government strategy announced in 2001 set the goal of putting all of Japan\u2019s administrative procedures online by 2003. Yet as of 2019 just 7.5% of the nearly 56,000 processes handled by the national government can be completed online. Mr Suga, however, is putting more weight behind the drive to digitise than any of his predecessors. A new \u201cdigital agency\u201d is being set up to oversee reforms. The creation of such a body not only signals the commitment of the prime minister, argues Nomura Atsuko of the Japan Research Institute, a think-tank in Tokyo, it also protects the project from the political winds.", "Covid-19 exposed Japan\u2019s \u201chalf-baked digitalisation\u201d, Mr Hirai says. Whereas South Korea got cash relief to 97% of households in two weeks, Japan\u2019s payments took months and in many cases required in-person visits or handwritten forms. Even applications for subsidies to buy equipment for teleworking had to be completed largely by hand. Such failures shook bureaucrats out of a long slumber. \u201cThese are things people need to do, that they know they need to do, but kicked the can down the road,\u201d Mr Hirai says. \u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d The ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently purchased 400 tablet computers for MP s to encourage them to go paperless, Mr Hirai smiles.", "The new agency, which will be launched soon, is meant to act as a \u201ccontrol tower\u201d for the government\u2019s IT policies. \u201cThe national government has its own digital architecture, each ministry has its own unique digital architecture, and then each local government has its own unique architecture, so there\u2019s no interoperability within the government,\u201d laments Sato Motohiko of the Japan Association of New Economy, an e-business lobby group. The agency will consolidate control over IT procurement previously devolved to different arms of government. Mr Hirai aims to shift the bureaucracy to cloud-based systems to make it easier to share data. The Daiwa Institute of Research, a think-tank, reckons that digitisation of government services could boost GDP per person by more than 1%\u2014a hefty improvement.", "The first step involves ending archaic habits. Kono Taro, Japan\u2019s minister for administrative reform, catalogued some 15,000 circumstances in which a hanko, or personal seal, was required to carry out a bureaucratic procedure; now, he says, only 83 remain. Fax machines, still a staple of the Japanese office, have come under fire. So too has the custom of sending email attachments as zip files with a password in a separate message, which does little to enhance security but causes untold inconvenience. After that come harder tasks. \u201cWe need to take the second step: from digitising data to utilising data,\u201d says a former senior official. That, in turn, will involve breaking down the barriers between ministries, says Robert Ward of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London.", "According to Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, goods consisting of intellectual property, such as software, account for less than 3% of the Japanese government\u2019s fixed assets, compared with 8% for America\u2019s. Wider adoption of the national ID card, known as \u201cMy Number\u201d, would make it easier to put services online, but many Japanese have resisted because of privacy concerns. Going digital also threatens to alienate the elderly. Mr Hirai envisions turning bureaucrats who now sit behind windows at counters receiving forms into \u201cdigital-support\u201d workers to help ageing residents learn to apply for services on smartphones."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["prime", "hirai", "thinktank", "minister", "online", "need", "drags", "required", "era", "digital", "update", "mr", "services", "japanese", "japans"], "pubDate": "2021-01-02T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
