We\u2019ve had plenty of protests. But then you started seeing more worry. You could feel the energy. It wasn\u2019t the tone, it was the face. Next they said, \u201cThey\u2019ve breached a wall, but everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Then there was another breach over here, a breach over there. It just kept cascading. That was when we started hearing, \u201cDo we have to bring the Speaker down from the rostrum?\u201d", "I\u2019m the floor director for Speaker Nancy Pelosi. My job is to make sure that the House floor runs properly. Any legislative procedure that comes into the chamber falls under my staff\u2019s purview. I came to D.C. after college, in the nineties, and started waiting tables at California Pizza Kitchen while I figured out how to get a job. I remember, when I first started working on the Hill, someone said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to leave when you don\u2019t have that tingle when you see the Capitol.\u201d Now I live a mile away, and when I walk to work the sun is behind me, shining on the Capitol, and when I walk out, if I turn around, I see the sun setting over the Capitol. It\u2019s special.", "Originally, we\u2019d been planning on spending more than twenty-four hours in the chamber. When the Arizona challenge happened, the Senate paraded out. They took the certified ballots with them in these big, fancy brown boxes that have been used for years.", "As the notices came in, I found my old boss, Congressman Jim McGovern, from Massachusetts. I said, \u201cHey, we might need you up in the chair, just hold tight.\u201d He\u2019s the chairman of the Rules Committee. He knows that sometimes the Speaker just needs a break.", "All of a sudden, it hit. They say, \u201cWe need to bring the Speaker down.\u201d I asked to not do this so fast that it\u2019s chaotic. Let\u2019s make it look normal. She was not expecting to come down. I said, \u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d We put Mr. McGovern up, she went out the doors, and she was out of my sight. The Majority Leader, the Majority Whip, and the Minority Whip, they were pulled out, too. That was when it really hit people.", "It was a weird vibe. Some were calm, some getting agitated, and then you had a machismo from some people. The noise in the chamber picked up. People were really loud, really not listening. I went into the center of the chamber and just yelled, \u201cEveryone sit down, stay calm, let\u2019s get some information!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s 2021, but I\u2019m still writing \u2018yearlong fever dream of chaos and despair\u2019 on my checks.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Joe Dator", "Capitol police said, \u201cThey\u2019re coming. They\u2019re inside the building.\u201d They told us to pull out escape hoods\u2014the gas masks. They started pointing: \u201cLock that door, lock that door!\u201d We helped the police move a couple of old, credenza-type bookshelves into place in front of the doors. We become a hermetically sealed room. You\u2019re not supposed to be able to get in. Well, at some point you start hearing: Bang! A couple of members were there. They were going to protect our colleagues, protect our friends, and protect the chamber.", "Capitol police decided we\u2019re evacuating. They opened one of the doors into the Speaker\u2019s lobby and started pushing people out. But up in the gallery there\u2019s no easy way out. It\u2019s literally like an obstacle course. I\u2019m pointing and yelling, \u201cGo, go, go! That way! Get through!\u201d The banging on the front door is intensifying. It sounded violent. All of a sudden you hear a crack. It sounded like a gunshot. The police had their guns out. And I just sprinted out of the chamber.", "We ran down some stairs, underground into these old, old spaces. Some older folks can\u2019t move all that quickly. It took us a while, but we finally got to, essentially, a holding area.", "We looked around the room. We didn\u2019t know what was happening, but we knew the Capitol had been overrun. Someone would say, \u201cWe\u2019re missing someone!\u201d The Capitol police would try to find them. And then you have this din, the mechanical filter of a hundred and fifty gas masks\u2014this high-pitched whirring. It sounded like a hundred and fifty kazoos.", "It was a weird mix. Remember, this was everyone who\u2019d been on the floor. In one corner, you had all the Republicans who think we stole the election. You can see people looking, thinking, The people outside are here because of what you\u2019re doing. We were also concerned about the fact that many of them don\u2019t wear masks. Some of them were saying they were glad the \u201cprotesters\u201d were there. Everybody else, including many Republicans, was figuring out what\u2019s happening, what\u2019s going on with our institution, with our society, with our democracy. And how do we get back? We knew we had to finish that night. It was never a question of if\u2014it was how. That\u2019s part of my job. I can\u2019t really get into this, but we have alternatives to the House chamber, if we need them.", "Someone said, \u201cWhere are the boxes? Do we still have them?\u201d One of the parliamentarians came over to me and said, \u201cThe ballot boxes are safe.\u201d If they\u2019d been stolen or destroyed, to be honest, I don\u2019t know what happens.", "We started to go back around seven. There was this powder everywhere, a film everywhere. Broken glass. The same doors that the President comes through for the State of the Union\u2014when they say, \u201cMadam Speaker, the President of the United States!\u201d\u2014you could see the holes where they\u2019d broken through.", "The workers did the best they could to clean up. Who knows where they went, and how they came back? They\u2019re scared, too. They brought in one of those industrial cleaners you see at the mall at, like, five in the morning. One congressman, Andy Kim, a real nice, soft-spoken man from New Jersey, was helping.", "The fact that the Capitol was invaded did not defuse tensions. When the Vice-President announced that Joe Biden is now the President-elect, people cheered. There was relief that we got this done. But it wasn\u2019t joyousness. There was a profound sadness afterward, and exhaustion, on the faces of my co-workers. All the trauma hit. This is the people\u2019s building. Every time a security threat makes it harder for someone to get in and see how our democracy works is just sad. But the fact that they\u2019d attack democracy\u2014physically and literally attack it? I never thought it would happen.", "When I headed home, it was about four.
