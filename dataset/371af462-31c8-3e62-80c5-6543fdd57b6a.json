Here\u2019s how Lind describes political correctness, for instance: \u201cthe artificial dialect devised by leftist activists and spread by university and corporate bureaucrats that serves as a class marker distinguishing the college-educated from the vulgar majority below them.\u201d In this framing, all the new awarenesses and sensitivities and humilities \u2014 for which I am profoundly thankful, since these days I\u2019m much less often asked where I\u2019m really from or told my English is impressive (thanks, they teach us well in Ohio!) \u2014 are just a ploy by leftists to hold white working-class people down. This understanding portrays the victims as the white working class, and the oppressors as those students who no longer wish to be called \u201cfaggots\u201d and secretaries tired of being \u201csweetie.\u201d I, for one, am grateful for all the thinking and doing that have changed how Americans navigate one another\u2019s identities, and I do not have the luxury of dismissing the improvement in the dignity I am accorded daily as an \u201cartificial dialect.\u201d", "Now, if you are going to present Trump as the receptacle of the cries of the unheard, you will need to funhouse-mirror him beyond recognition. Lind is on it. He takes the quintessential racist moment of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his famous comments on Charlottesville \u2014 and defends them: \u201cPhrases from his remarks were taken out of context, recombined and misconstrued so they could fit into the Trump-is-Hitler narrative.\u201d He also dismisses concerns about Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election as \u201cmythological thinking.\u201d \u201cLiberal democracy in the West today is not endangered by Russian machinations or resurgent fascism,\u201d Lind writes, describing a world I would love to live in. In fact, get this: Lind believes the \u201cparanoid demonological thinking\u201d represented by worries about Russia and fascism \u201chas the potential to be a greater danger to liberal democracy in the West than any particular populist movements.\u201d", "So dismissive is Lind of the idea that Trumpism has fascist echoes that he refers to such claims as a Brown Scare, a reference to Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts. I\u2019m no stranger to a Brown Scare, but, in my definition, it\u2019s just me being brown and scared of my country losing its liberties, stature and mind.", "Somewhere in here is the kernel of a good book: Lind\u2019s original focus was oligarchy, and there is a way to end it, he says. \u201cTo supplement conventional electoral politics, reformers will need to rebuild old institutions or build new ones that can integrate working-class citizens of all origins into decision-making in government, the economy and the culture, so that everyone can be an insider.\u201d", "Still, what is missing from the book, and might have saved it, is actual human beings. I sometimes ask my nearly 5-year-old how he knows something, and he often says, like the man he\u2019s learning to be, \u201cI just know it in my brain.\u201d This is a book written from the brain more than from the collision with the complexities of experience. It is a book that would have benefited from getting out there, interviewing people, testing theories against reality, heading down to the border, unearthing documents showing how companies think about the issues in question.", "\u201cThe New Class War\u201d lacks the texture and earth and seduction of real portraiture. Lind derides the \u201coverclass\u201d but doesn\u2019t break any ground in depicting it. When he somewhat outdatedly says the tech industry makes \u201csoftware\u201d or elite city dwellers employ services like \u201cFingernail Former,\u201d we get the sense of a man who has read more about the world than actually encountered it. When he says, \u201cThe rootedness of most working-class Americans and Europeans in their hometowns and regions is often lamented by the intellectuals of the managerial overclass: Why don\u2019t the lazy losers in heartland communities show some initiative and move to the Bay Area to invent an app, or relocate to London to work in finance?\u201d I realized that Lind was reporting from the inside of his own mind.", "\u201cThe New Class War\u201d is a reminder that, even in the Trump era \u2014 especially in the Trump era \u2014 it is curiosity rather than certainty that must propel us. What can be so exciting about books is watching authors end up far from where they began, carried forth by not knowing, wanting to know, then slowly knowing more, realizing what is still not known, plowing on, thinking, rethinking, going on a meandering intellectual journey that justifies you later going on a fractal of that journey with them."], "authors": ["Anand Giridharadas"], "keywords": ["im", "going", "book", "support", "class", "supporters", "world", "trump", "thinking", "brown", "lind", "workingclass"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
