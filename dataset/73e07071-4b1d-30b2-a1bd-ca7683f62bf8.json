Three days of celebrations had been planned.\u201d They anticipated having around 250 guests attend the wedding, but in May it became very clear that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t going anywhere, so they decided to postpone their large celebration to an undetermined time after the pandemic ends.", "\u201cEnsuring our family and friends remained healthy was most important to us,\u201d Elise says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would be able to live with ourselves if someone became sick as a result of attending our wedding. Needless to say, given the state restrictions, having the wedding or anything close to it was not going to be an option.\u201d", "As the pandemic continued, the couple decided in June that they still wanted to get married in 2020, albeit in a much smaller way, as there was no way to predict the timeline for the virus. \u201cWe thought, What if we postpone a year and COVID is still dominant, with no feasible solution in sight? Or, What if this pandemic continues for two years? We ultimately decided we would get married on our original date\u2014September 5, 2020\u2014but would change the location to Oregon wine country, since we both love wine and enjoy exploring the region.\u201d", "About two weeks later, CJ was notified that the 2019\u20132020 basketball season would resume inside the \u201cNBA bubble\u201d in Florida from July until mid-October. This meant he would be living in Orlando and not allowed to leave until his season was over. Their plans were dashed yet again, as September 5 was now officially out of the question.", "While CJ was away in August, Elise began trying to find another date that might work with both of their busy schedules. \u201cWe decided the best time would be at the end of October, as his season would likely resume in December and November would be used for training,\u201d she explains.", "Once they landed on October, they went from a guest list of 250 to 20. At that point, the planning process was restarted entirely: new date, new location, new guest list, with less than two months to do everything. \u201cWhile my mom was visiting me in August, we checked out the Black Walnut Inn, and we both fell in love with it,\u201d Elise says. \u201cThe scenery was stunning, and they had exactly enough rooms to accommodate our 20 guests.\u201d The couple asked all guests to get a COVID test 48 hours prior to their arrival in Oregon and send in their results. When everyone arrived at the inn, each person had a rapid COVID test, and every single staff member working on site at every event location was rapid-tested each morning. \u201cWe were really worried about having our families, more specifically our grandmothers, traveling during the pandemic, and wanted to make sure we took all the proper precautions to avoid any unnecessary exposure,\u201d Elise says.", "Elise\u2019s wedding gown, along with her after-party dress and several other looks, were created by Danielle Frankel. \u201cI envisioned myself in a gown that was chic, elegant, and timeless. I wanted it to be a reflection of my style. I also was hoping to wear a gown with long sleeves since that was what my mother wore to her wedding. When I described what I was looking for to my stylist, Tara Maietta, she knew exactly where to go and introduced me to Danielle.\u201d Elise\u2019s final choice\u2014the Sloane gown\u2014was a dark ivory crepe dress with natural baroque pearl buttons. \u201cWhen you look closely, you can see each of the pearls are different shapes and have an iridescent glow,\u201d she says. \u201cDanielle also made a custom pleated tulle veil with Chantilly lace trim. She had this whole vision in her mind, and it was perfect. It\u2019s safe to say Danielle Frankel is a chic bride's holy grail.\u201d For jewelry, Elise wore vintage Fred Leighton earrings, gifted to her by CJ on her wedding day, and she finished off the entire look with ivory Jimmy Choo pumps.", "CJ wore a three-piece handmade ensemble made from Cacciopoli Italian fabric; each garment was handmade, along with the shirt and matching handmade silk bow tie, by Antar Levar. Stylist Maietta was also the mastermind behind the wedding party\u2019s looks\u2014chic gowns in a medley of textures and fall colors. \u201cIt was important [to me that] my friends love what they were wearing, so Tara worked closely with each person to bring our vision to life,\u201d Elise explains.", "At the end of October, the weather can vary to a great degree in Oregon wine country. \u201cA typical day is chilly, wet, foggy, and tops at 40 degrees,\u201d Elise says. \u201cWell, we got lucky; we had a three-day celebration that was cold, actually a freeze on the first night, but there wasn\u2019t any rain!\u201d", "On the day of the wedding, the foliage in and around the vineyard was just beginning to change, making for the perfect picturesque fall day. \u201cWe keep thinking there must have been divine intervention because that type of weather at the end of October does not exist,\u201d Elise jokes.", "The ceremony started at about 3:30 in the afternoon. \u201cWe began early because I was not keen on doing a first look, but rather envisioned our ceremony with the traditional approach of seeing each other for the first time as I was walking down the aisle,\u201d Elise notes. Both the bride and the groom walked down the aisle accompanied by their parents\u2014something they each felt strongly about. \u201cAs my parents walked me down the aisle, a string trio played their wedding song \u2018Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love with You\u2019 by Elvis Presley,\u201d Elise says. \u201cI felt like the luckiest girl on the planet. It felt surreal, a suspended reality. I couldn\u2019t wait to get down the aisle and tell CJ how handsome he looked. It was hard for me to wait until the end of the ceremony to kiss him.\u201d", "The couple\u2019s puppy Fiona served as their flower girl, and friends read poetry and Bible passages that had significance to the couple throughout the service. The bride and groom wrote their own vows and exchanged handwritten cards prior to the wedding. \u201cI read CJ\u2019s card right before I walked down the aisle in the bathroom because I knew I would have a tear or two,\u201d Elise says. \u201cHe truly has a way with words and is unbelievably articulate in expressing his emotions.\u201d At the end of the service, the brass band came out in celebration as the newlyweds recessed down the aisle and jumped over the broom.", "During dinner, guests toasted glasses of McCollum Heritage 91, CJ\u2019s new wine, which had just been released in September. \u201cFor a small group, we had a very vibrant dance floor [after dinner],\u201d Elise says. \u201cMy 91-year-old grandmother danced with me like a 20-year old-when her song came on! Dancing with her to \u2018St. Louis Blues\u2019 will always be a special memory for me.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Macon", "Alexandra Maco"], "keywords": ["espositos", "mccollum", "intimate", "affair", "elise", "aisle", "love", "planning", "country", "wine", "oregon", "location", "pandemic", "end", "wedding", "cj"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
