It is worst in red wine, when the skins are used to create colour.", "The president of the New South Wales Wine Industry Association, Mark Bourne, said the industry was sampling and monitoring grapes in the Hunter Valley and other regions that could be affected by smoke taint.", "Bourne said early tests had come back negative for smoke taint, and the association\u2019s focus was on supporting people employed by the NSW wine industry who might have been adversely affected by the fires.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early to speculate on the potential effects of this season\u2019s grapes and wines because we haven\u2019t hit veraison yet, the main risk period,\u201d Bourne said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t a great deal that growers can do [to prevent smoke taint].\u201d", "A heatwave this week, which is forecast to produce four days above 40C in South Australia\u2019s Barossa Valley, could also cause stressed grapevines to drop leaves, leaving them at greater risk of sunburn later in the season.", "The Barossa Valley has a mix of non-irrigated heritage vineyards, with vines 70 to 120 years old, and younger irrigated vineyards.", "Australian wine under threat from climate change, as grapes ripen early Read more", "\u201cIt is ominous getting 44C, 45C days at this time of the year,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cBut if vineyards are going to have these temperatures it\u2019s better to have it now than to have it after veraison.\u201d", "Vineyards in Mildura and Swan Hill, where temperatures are expected to reach up to 47C on Friday, and where grapes have already begun to ripen, could lose fruit.", "Extreme heat can cause leaves to droop, or in severe cases drop off, leaving grapes exposed to sunburn. That causes discolouration and affects the flavour profile of the wine. Before the grapes have swelled and ripened, Barlow said, the risk of extreme heat is that dropped leaves will leave grapes unshaded and at greater risk of sunburn later in the growing season.", "That can be managed provided vineyards still have access to enough water \u2013 which they don\u2019t in many areas across South Australia, central and northern Victoria, and NSW.", "\u201cFor the next few months irrigation management is going to be critical for most growers,\u201d Bourne said. \u201cThese extreme weather events are of great concern to the wine industry. We can\u2019t choose not to plant a crop, we can\u2019t sell off livestock.
