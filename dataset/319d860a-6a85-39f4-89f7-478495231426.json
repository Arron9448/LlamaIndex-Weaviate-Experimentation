This low-budget effort \u2013 alternatively titled with its initials, FEAR \u2013 falls somewhere between The Walking Dead, A Quiet Place, The Revenant and It Comes at Night \u2013 but, like its central family, it struggles to find a place to call its own.", "The setting is a scenic, snowy, mountainous region, presumably in North America, and the opening crawl ramps up the Covid resonance: a world struck by a deadly virus, a sealed-off area where \u201cevery day we fight to survive. Hiding. Scavenging. Clinging to hope \u2026\u201d Thus, we are up to speed when a growling, raving, zombie-like madman comes charging through the woods at combat-ready Ethan (Jason Tobias, who co-directed and co-wrote) and his nervous son (Danny Ruiz).", "Back at home \u2013 though their rundown shack barely fits the description \u2013 are resourceful mum Joe (Marci Miller) and a teenage daughter who has succumbed to the zombie virus, and is strapped to a bed upstairs on life support. (The family are holding out for access to a cure.)", "This already precarious existence is threatened further when they are raided by marauders equipped with superior firearms and human shields. The result of their violent battle is a negotiated standoff that splits the action: Joe keeps her gun on the marauders\u2019 scheming matriarch (a convincingly fiery Susan Moore Harmon), Ethan goes with her brother to fetch medicine and fuel from their camp. Nobody trusts anyone \u2013 nor should they.", "As action gives way to extended dialogue scenes and flashbacks to happier, pre-apocalypse times, the pace slackens.
