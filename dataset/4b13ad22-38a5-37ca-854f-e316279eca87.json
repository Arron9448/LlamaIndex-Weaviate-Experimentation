Nonetheless, we were wrong to alter the image.", "\u201cWe have removed the current display and will replace it as soon as possible with one that uses the unaltered image. We apologize, and will immediately start a thorough review of our exhibit policies and procedures so that this does not happen again.\u201d", "The Washington Post first reported the story, on the eve of the 2020 Women\u2019s March, which partly thanks to cold and wet weather was expected to attract smaller crowds than in previous years.", "The photograph in question showed a massive crowd in Washington on 21 January 2017, one day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Blown up to 49in x 69in, the image \u201cgreeted visitors\u201d to an exhibition commemorating the 100th anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage in the US, the Post said.", "It added: \u201cViewed from another angle, it shifts to show a 1913 black-and-white image of a women\u2019s suffrage march also on Pennsylvania Avenue. The display links momentous demonstrations for women\u2019s rights more than a century apart on the same stretch of pavement.\u201d", "As it turned out, the 2017 photograph by Mario Tama had been digitally altered. Tama\u2019s original shows that many of those marching held signs. The Post revealed that the Archives\u2019 version featured a minimum of four such signs that had been digitally altered placards.", "One sign that said \u201cGod Hates Trump\u201d in the original had \u201cTrump\u201d blurred out in the version on display. Another sign reading \u201cTrump & GOP \u2013 Hands Off Women\u201d also had \u201cTrump\u201d obscured.", "Changes were also made to images of posters which mentioned women\u2019s anatomy. One, stating \u201cIf my vagina could shoot bullets, it\u2019d be less REGULATED\u201d was \u201cdigitally altered\u201d to blur the word \u201cvagina\u201d. On a sign that read \u201cThis Pussy Grabs Back\u201d in the original photograph \u2013 in reference to infamous remarks by Trump \u2013 \u201cpussy\u201d was gone in the Archives\u2019 version.", "The Archives claimed managers and staffers made the decision to alter the image while developing the exhibit.", "\u201cAs a non-partisan, non-political federal agency, we blurred references to the president\u2019s name on some posters, so as not to engage in current political controversy,\u201d a spokeswoman told the Post.", "\u201cOur mission is to safeguard and provide access to the nation\u2019s most important federal records, and our exhibits are one way in which we connect the American people to those records. Modifying the image was an attempt on our part to keep the focus on the records.\u201d", "The spokeswoman also said the agency decided to hide words describing women\u2019s genitals because such terms could be considered inappropriate for display. She claimed the agency \u201conly alters images in exhibits when they are used as graphic design components\u201d.", "The reporter who broke the story, Joe Heim, explained on Twitter how he did it. He said he was at the Archives for a \u201ca totally unrelated story about tourists coming to look at the constitution (a story I still hope to write)\u201d when he noticed the image.", "\u201cI stopped to look at it. As I was trying to read some of the signs the marchers were carrying, I noticed one was blurred out. I thought that was odd and so I looked more closely at the rest of the image and saw other signs that had been blurred. So I took the photocredit info.\u201d", "Heim wrote that he \u201cwalked back to my office and found the original photo online. Our photo editor, Mark Miller, printed it out for me. I took it back to the Archives to compare against the one on display and that\u2019s how I determined what had been changed.", "\u201cThen I contacted the Archives.\u201d"], "authors": ["Https", "Www.Theguardian.Com Profile Victoria-Bekiempis", "Victoria Bekiempis"], "keywords": ["signs", "blurring", "altered", "sorry", "national", "archives", "antitrump", "image", "womens", "display", "blurred", "original", "trump", "washington"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
