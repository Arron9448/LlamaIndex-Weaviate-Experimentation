Here, four people share their experiences of emerging from the latest lockdown.", "\u2018It was freezing, but it was so nice to be in a space with somebody\u2019", "Charlene Robinson, 47, enjoyed a burst of good luck during last week\u2019s reopening; in October she had booked a holiday on the off-chance they might be allowed. Along with her husband, two children and a puppy who joined the family during lockdown, Robinson travelled from their home in Nottingham to Margate in Kent for a four-day stay last week.", "Charlene Robinson on the beach in Margate. Photograph: Charlene Robinson/Guardian Community", "Robinson is originally from Kent, and her brothers still live there, so the families met in turns for the first time in more than six months, enjoying picnics on the beach and outdoor dining at restaurants.", "\u201cIt was freezing, but it was so nice to be in a space with somebody, rather than on a screen or texting. It felt like coming home,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was nice to see the kids well, and they had grown. They had a bit more swagger.\u201d", "Robinson, a counsellor who continued to go into work during lockdown, says she did not find the social interactions too overwhelming. \u201cI had seen more of my colleagues and clients than family, which made the transition to being around people a little bit easier.\u201d", "Her family are close, and usually see each other at school holidays, so she was left \u201cheartbroken\u201d when plans for Christmas reunions fell through after the government\u2019s U-turn. \u201cYou take family for granted,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I saw them that I thought: \u2018This is what it\u2019s all about.\u2019\u201d", "\u2018This week has proved how necessary social interactions are\u2019", "\u201cAt first I thought that coming back to life would be difficult,\u201d says Francisco Martin, 22, a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cI no longer enjoy being too close to people, and it unconsciously comes with some anxiety. However, as if nothing had happened in the last 13 months, I slowly made use of the restrictions being lifted.\u201d", "On Tuesday, he enjoyed drinks in the park with colleagues at the university for the first time since he joined six months ago, and later with friends in Shoreditch.", "Francisco Martin in Greenwich Park.

However, this did not put him off.", "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how cold it was, or how ridiculously high the prices can be in London for a not-so-fancy drink, I missed worrying about spending the little money I have.\u201d He also popped in for a much-needed trip to the hairdressers.", "After months of isolation due to coronavirus restrictions, Martin described the easing as \u201cfeeling amazing\u201d.", "\u201cWith very little social activity, and the uncertainty around the future, my mental health took a very hard hit,\u201d he says. \u201cThis week has proved how necessary social interactions are \u2026 things I didn\u2019t even value in the past like getting a haircut or having spontaneous plans now feel like a luxury, a treasure to appreciate.\u201d", "\u2018It was really overwhelming, being really stressed and having to rush through huge throngs of people\u2019", "Kate Katafiasz and her dog, Django.

I hadn\u2019t realised until I started to come out of lockdown how digitised my life had become,\u201d she says.", "While Katafiasz says having conversation with others in person was \u201clovely\u201d, she was thrown off by the traffic and large number of people on the streets as hospitality venues reopened.", "\u201cI had thought it would take 15 minutes to get there, but it took much longer. The area was heaving with people going out for a drink. It was really overwhelming, being really stressed and having to rush through huge throngs of people,\u201d she says. \u201cNow being out and about is accompanied by paranoia over whether people are distancing.\u201d", "However, the reopening was smoother for her dog, Django, which went on a walk with other dogs this week. \u201cIn lockdown we haven\u2019t been able to do the pack walks,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the dog also experienced coming out of lockdown. It allowed him to socialise too.\u201d", "\u2018I can\u2019t see myself going to a pub or a restaurant\u2019", "Simone Bengochea and her daughter Alba.

I went for a walk with my baby and husband and all the restaurants and pubs had full outdoor terraces. I panicked. I just turned the buggy around and went home, and stayed in for the entire weekend.\u201d", "\u201cUsually I take 11-month-old Alba on a daily walk to the park, which is about five minutes along a street, which has a pub, a pizzeria and a few shops. I\u2019m used to it being quiet,\u201d says Bengochea. \u201cSuddenly, there was a long queue outside Sainsbury\u2019s, and I\u2019m trying to dodge everyone and keep a 2-metre distance. The sidewalks are full of chairs and tables.\u201d", "Bengochea is opting to visit the park only during quieter hours, such as late morning. However, she says she is not planning to immediately take advantage of outdoor hospitality reopening.", "\u201cI can\u2019t see myself going to a pub or a restaurant,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friends and workmates are like: \u2018Let\u2019s go have a drink,\u2019 but I just think: \u2018You\u2019re crazy.
