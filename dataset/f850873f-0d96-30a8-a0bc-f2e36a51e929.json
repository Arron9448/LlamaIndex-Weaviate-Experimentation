Because Disco Elysium incorporates some of these common elements, it fooled me into thinking I was in familiar narrative territory. I was not. As the hours unfolded, this investigative RPG surprised and delighted me at almost every turn with its complex world, fantastic dialogue, and ability to convey a constant struggle with the warring facets of one\u2019s own mind.", "Both as a human and a detective, Disco Elysium\u2019s leading man is a disaster \u2013 but deciding precisely what kind of disaster is the heart of this fascinating, story-driven murder mystery. Is he an alcoholic trash fire? A delusional prophet of the apocalypse? The answer emerges slowly as you search for clues in the fictional city of Revachol, making choices during conversation and exploration that give you a clearer picture of the miserable person you\u2019ve become. Maybe you elect to refer to yourself as a \u201csuperstar cop\u201d while sporting a pained grimace you cannot suppress. Maybe you break down crying while telling a young woman to wear a hat. Maybe you botch a sad karaoke song despite your best efforts. The sharp writing in exchanges like these made me laugh out loud, and the game does an amazing job remembering and referencing your previous deeds \u2013 even things that seem unimportant \u2013 which creates a sense of reactivity and consistency that few games can match.", "Even more impressive is how much nuance is communicated internally, through your character\u2019s thoughts. This is made possible through Disco Elysium\u2019s crowning achievement: 24 distinct personality aspects representing your mind and body, each of which may chime in at any time with dialogue exchanges that offer encouragement, provide guidance, or goad you into folly. Though they are a part of you, these aspects also feel like different characters vying for control, with different goals and manners of speaking; Physical Instrument is always eager for violence, Authority wants to assert dominance, and Drama always calls you \u201csire.\u201d Depending on how you want to play, you may trust certain aspects\u2019 interjections over others, and their frequent intrusions create the compelling sense that your character is always teetering on the brink of sanity.", "Since Disco Elysium has no combat mechanics, your investigation\u2019s successes and failures are determined through dice-roll checks tied to each personality aspect, with higher chances for passing if you\u2019ve invested skill points in the appropriate area. The concept is neat, but it feels a little too arbitrary in practice. With 24 different available aspects and no way of knowing which ones might benefit you in the future, the process of spending your skill points is fuzzy at best. For instance, if you neglect Composure in the early hours, you will probably throw up when you first approach the victim\u2019s corpse and be unable to proceed. You can attempt the check again after putting some points in Composure, but earning those points takes time, and you still aren\u2019t guaranteed a success. So, even though the game seemingly embraces a \u201cplay how you want\u201d philosophy, it also withholds important and excellent moments if you don\u2019t invest points in specific ways \u2013 or repeatedly save and reload to brute-force certain checks \u2013 which is disappointing.", "Even with some behind-the-curtain issues, the unique world in front of you in Disco Elysium feels magical. Though the sliver of Revachol you explore is small, its history feels as large as a sprawling epic fantasy. People tell you about wars long lost, paranormal phenomena, and deific figures. The attention to detail creates a fantastical setting that still feels grounded; a melancholy thread runs through it all, but the city is cold and desolate, and the people within it reflect that beautifully. I specifically need to praise Lt. Kim Kitsuragi, who is a great companion character and the perfect foil to the protagonist\u2019s spiraling mess of impulses.", "A few moments of frustration aren\u2019t enough to dim the surreal glow of Disco Elysium. Trying to contain your glorious catastrophe of a \u201chero\u201d can be simultaneously amusing and horrifying, and that\u2019s before you even consider the events of the case surrounding him. I won\u2019t spoil any of the major story beats, but the central mystery has immaculate pacing, with new layers and complications folding in at just the right moments. Plus, the payoff is satisfying and surprising. The team at developer ZA/UM only lets you spend a handful of in-game days as a part of Disco Elysium\u2019s world, but now that the case is closed, I hope I can report for duty again in the future."], "authors": ["Online Content Director", "Joe Joined The Game Informer Staff In He Loves Final Fantasy", "Mass Effect", "The Elder Scrolls", "Assassin'S Creed", "Metal Gear.
