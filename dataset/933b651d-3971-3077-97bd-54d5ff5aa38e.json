Far from shrinking into the shadows, their post-royal lives have been highly visible.", "They urged Americans to vote in the US presidential election (a move criticized for breaching the British royal family's tradition of political neutrality). Then, in an op-ed for the New York Times, Meghan revealed she had suffered a miscarriage earlier in the year, another example of high-profile figures helping to break the taboo around pregnancy loss. And, like the Obamas, the pair is set to become Hollywood producers, closing a multi-year deal with Netflix that will see them create scripted series, docu-series, documentaries, features and children's programming.", "'Parasite' made history at the Oscars", "Bong Joon-ho poses with his engraved awards on February 9, 2020.
