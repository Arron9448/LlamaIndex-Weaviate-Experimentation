[Teamwork] is what you\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s a team sport and those two guys are special.", "\u201cFroome is the greatest Grand Tour rider of his generation, and Bernal \u2026 to win a Tour at 22, he could have 10 or 12 years of being super-competitive. But at least I will always have that Tour win.\u201d", "Thomas fell short this year in his attempt to win a second Tour in a row and he ended the season without a win, in stark contrast to 2018 when he landed seven victories including the overall standings at the Tour with back-to-back mountain stage wins along the way and the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9.", "\u201cWith second in the Tour [in 2019] I can be happy and proud, but at the time it was disappointing. From the start, the way the season went, and the off-season. The buildup was nothing like 2018, but I was still confident.\u201d", "\u201cIt was a shame about the cancelled stage [in the Alps] and the shortened day. It leaves an unknown. You can\u2019t say Egan shouldn\u2019t have won, but there is a bit of an unknown.\u201d", "If he has one regret about this year\u2019s Tour, Thomas says, it is the Pyrenean stage into Foix, where he felt he did not make a full-on effort. \u201cI could have pushed harder. I sat back a bit. I was feeling good, and I could have gone quicker. But that\u2019s how Grand Tours go \u2013 you have off days when you limit your losses and on the good days you need to make the most of it.\u201d", "Thomas acknowledges that the question of who will lead Team Ineos at the 2020 Tour de France will be raised constantly until next July, but expects it to be resolved in the same way that the question was settled in 2018 and 2019.", "\u201cWe will deal with it as we have done [in the past]. When I won and Froome was third, when Egan won and I was second, the reason we both finished on the podium was that we were open and honest with each other. We pulled in the same direction, never chased each other down.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Geraint Thomas feels he \u2018could have pushed harder\u2019 in stage 15 of this year\u2019s Tour de France. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters", "In terms of his personal objective for next year, Thomas has the Tour firmly in his mind, but has yet to fix his programme. \u201cI\u2019m looking at targeting the Tour. We need to confirm it all, to chat it through, but at the moment it\u2019s all about the Tour again.\u201d It was, no doubt, with that in mind that this week he completed a marathon 190-mile lap of Majorca at his training camp, spending eight hours in the saddle at 22mph.", "There is, he says, no chance in the short term at least that he will line up the Giro d\u2019Italia or Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a as a target simply to ensure that he has an unhindered run at team leadership.", "\u201cYou have to weigh up your position in the team and it\u2019s about what motivates you. There is no point going to the Giro just to be the leader and only being 95% motivated. You need to be all-in. I\u2019d love to do the Giro [to win] one year, but next year what excites me is the Tour again.\u201d", "This is not the most straightforward of close seasons for Dave Brailsford\u2019s squad, with Froome still getting over the accident that cost him most of the 2019 season and left him with multiple fractures including to his femur, elbow and ribs.", "Froome has yet to race again, and asked about his teammate\u2019s chances of returning to the top, Thomas said: \u201cI think [he can] but I don\u2019t know how quickly or how good [he will be]. It was such a horrific crash. How and when is the million dollar question.\u201d", "Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.", "Thomas is one of the few to have raced with Brailsford\u2019s Sky and Ineos since its inception in 2010, but he said he has not paid great attention to the current medical tribunal involving Team Sky\u2019s former doctor Richard Freeman, or the allegations around the team\u2019s former coach Shane Sutton. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t followed it too much. All I saw was Shane talking on BBC Breakfast about being able to get it up. It\u2019s crazy, Freeman against Shane, thrashing it out.\u201d", "Closer to home, however, is the departure of Thomas\u2019s former mentor Rod Ellingworth, the 2018 Tour winner\u2019s coach since his days in the Great Britain academy 15 years ago. Ellingworth now runs Bahrain-McLaren, and will be directly pitted against his former squad. \u201cI definitely miss him, 100%. But it\u2019s a great opportunity for him, I hope he has success there, but hopefully not when I\u2019m around. It\u2019s strange without him. Being [in Majorca] now, I keep expecting him to walk around the corner and say: \u2018How are you doing?\u2019\u201d", "Geraint Thomas: The Road Will Decide, Thursday 19 December, 9pm, BBC One Wales and BBC iPlayer"], "authors": ["William Fotheringham"], "keywords": ["tour", "way", "team", "bernals", "ineos", "ambitions", "2018", "geraint", "win", "stage", "won", "bbc", "egan", "worries", "limit", "thomas", "victory"]}
