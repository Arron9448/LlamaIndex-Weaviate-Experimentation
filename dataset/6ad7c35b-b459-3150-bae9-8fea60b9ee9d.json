The match-up would be a huge moneyspinner after their last fight, in October 2018, ended in acrimony and violence. McGregor taunted his Russian opponent before that fight, and made negative references to his Muslim faith. Worse was to come when Nurmagomedov ended up brawling with some of his opponent\u2019s entourage after defeating the Irishman. Both men received suspensions and fines for their part in the tawdry scenes.", "Conor McGregor destroys Donald Cerrone in 40 seconds on UFC return Read more", "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at Hagler-Hearns,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at like Ali-Foreman, Ali-Frazier. This is a massive fight with global appeal. It\u2019s the fight you make, it\u2019s the fight that makes sense. It\u2019s for the 155lbs title \u2026 Khabib is the fight to make. It\u2019s huge for Khabib\u2019s legacy, too. If he beat Conor McGregor, then he beats Tony Ferguson, then he beats Conor McGregor again, I mean this is how this kid, when he retires, he\u2019s 30-something-and-0 and he\u2019s beaten all of the best.\u201d", "Nurmagomedov is due to fight Tony Ferguson in April, and on Saturday McGregor hinted he did not want to wait while the Russian recovered from his next bout.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think the \u2018who\u2019 matters,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThe who doesn\u2019t matter for me now. I\u2019m looking at dates now. I know March was there. I\u2019m going to have a look at a calendar and see where we\u2019re at \u2026 I\u2019ll be ready. I\u2019ll have a celebration tonight. I\u2019ll chill with my kids tomorrow. I\u2019ll show [my son] Junior the fight on the telly and see how he reacts. I\u2019ll see what he thinks of it. Then back to training.\u201d", "McGregor also expressed an interest in fighting Ferguson, welterweight Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, who he fought in two high-profile contests in 2016. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Nathan,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, brother. [Fight] number three is always here. We\u2019re right here, Nathan.\u201d", "There could also be a move away from mixed martial arts. After Saturday\u2019s bout, Floyd Mayweather posted a fake promotional advert for a rematch of their 2017 boxing fight. That contest earned both men tens of millions of dollars, even though the quality of boxing on show was debatable. Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters of all time, won that fight in 10 rounds after toying with McGregor, who had never boxed professionally before.", "\u201cHe forgot \u2018McGregor Sports and Entertainment\u2019 on the poster,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThat right there cuts him out, so it\u2019s me and Manny [Pacquiao]. Let\u2019s see what happens. That Floyd, he\u2019s a funny man, that Floyd. We\u2019ll see what happens. The discussions are always on going. They never stop. You know Floyd is going through money fast. He\u2019s far from retired, and that rematch will happen at some stage.\u201d"], "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "keywords": ["mayweather", "nurmagomedov", "conor", "ponders", "looking", "lets", "fights", "mcgregor", "fight", "floyd", "diaz", "ufc", "going", "ill", "rematch", "hes"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
