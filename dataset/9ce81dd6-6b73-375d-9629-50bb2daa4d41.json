They met on MySpace 12 years ago. \u201cTo be honest, we didn\u2019t intend to ever get married,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something we prioritized! But as we\u2019ve gotten older, and experienced so much and been through so much, we felt like we deserved to celebrate our love and what we\u2019ve achieved together.\u201d", "Last year, they decided to take a big trip to Tokyo, Japan in honor of their 12th anniversary. \u201cIt was there that we decided together that we wanted to get engaged,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cWe woke up one day, went to design our rings at Shihara studio, grabbed a bowl of ramen, and then spent our engagement night at the Park Hyatt Hotel. We had a celebratory drink in the New York Bar, and then got room service. It was simple, perfect, collaborative. We did it our way.\u201d", "Once they were Stateside again, they turned to wedding planning. \u201cThe aesthetic was very much informed by our personal taste, our emo back story, and our Welsh roots,\u201d Lydia explains. She and Roo were both raised surrounded by nature in South Wales, and they knew they wanted to get married where they grew up and fell in love. \u201cWe always used to drive past this field every time we used to see each other and talk about how beautiful it was,\u201d Lydia remembers. \u201cSo one day my mum just approached the farmer, told him our story, and he agreed to let us have our wedding there, amidst the gothic fallen trees, flowing river, majestic oaks, and yew trees.\u201d", "Lydia and Roo are both visual creatives; they wanted their day to reflect their tastes and memories. \u201cWe had the ceremony in front of a dead tree, ate our favorite food, got tattoos, and named our tables after emo songs,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cI found art directing the whole day easy, effortless, and really fun. As someone who has dedicated their life to storytelling, it was special to be able to tell our story through all the little experience design moments.\u201d", "Everything had a gothic edge\u2014which to the couple means beauty in some state of decay\u2014and they worked to celebrate the natural surroundings. \u201cI\u2019m half Chinese so you\u2019ll notice details referencing that,\u201d Lydia says. The invitations included a Chinese proverb, then there were red envelopes filled with confetti, drunken dim sum at midnight, custom fortune cookies with the couple\u2019s favorite emo lyrics in them, and even chopsticks engraved with each person\u2019s name that served as place cards.", "It was an intimate gathering\u2014with 70 guests that had come from L.A., Hong Kong, New York City, London, and beyond\u2014set against a wild Welsh backdrop and drawing from a vendor list that was 100% female, which was a huge priority for the couple. \u201cMy parents also put a lot of work into making the day really unique,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cMy father is an incredible chef and worked to source all of the ingredients from local farms and fishermen. My mother is a curator and gallery owner so she set an incredible vision and curated the tables, the French linen, and plates.\u201d Everything they bought or sourced was later recycled, reused, or gifted to guests so as to result in minimal waste.", "Lydia art directed her wardrobe as well. \u201cI wanted to be comfortable, larger than life, gothic, but feminine and modern\u2014as well as work with a young female designer,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone who understood my aesthetic, who embraced unique construction techniques. Upon finding Katie Roberts-Wood and meeting with her team, I knew we\u2019d make magic happen. From her belief system around empowering women through design, to her studio filled with clouds of fabric and her barking dog, I knew she would create a dress that embodied everything I wanted\u2014and she exceeded all expectations.\u201d", "Beauty and hair were kept simple and natural. \u201cI chose an elegant low bun for my hair,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cI knew a lot of my choices were a little punk and modern so I wanted notes of classic throughout\u2014also because when I went for my last fitting my mum and best mate both screamed: \u2018Oh you need your hair up!\u2019 as soon as they saw the epic detailing on the back of the dress.\u201d", "On the day of the wedding, guests found their seats in front of a fallen dead tree that had a huge flower installation by Vervain flowers around it. \u201cYou could hear the river flowing and the sun shone really bright that day\u2014unusual for Wales!\u201d Lydia remembers. The mother of the bride and bridesmaids all walked down the aisle first while a jazz band played \u201cOh, It Is Love\u201d by Hellogoodbye in the background. \u201cThis was the song that was on my MySpace when we met,\u201d Lydia notes. The bride then walked down the aisle with her dad, and best friend Abbie Bergstrom conducted the ceremony. \u201cIt was funny, light, and short,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cThat\u2019s how we wanted it.\u201d", "Once the service was over, the newlyweds walked back down the aisle, and everyone opened their Chinese red envelopes to find dried black cornflower confetti to throw up in the air. \u201cWe went right from the ceremony to our tattoo studio for some time alone and our couple tattoos,\u201d Lydia says. Meanwhile, guests enjoyed cocktails on the lawn by the river.", "The reception was held in a yurt on the property. It was all about food\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re a huge foodie family!\u201d Lydia says. \u201cThe feast was absolutely epic. A massive part of our family and culture is to really show joy through food. I loved seeing my dad stand up in front of everyone and explain how to eat a gooseneck barnacle, and that it got everyone talking, discovering, eating with their hands. It set the tone for sure!\u201d", "In between courses, guests hopped out to get tattoos, and every time someone returned from the studio, the crowd would cheer. \u201cMy mother-in-law\u2014who is in her 60s!\u2014went to get her first-ever tattoo and came back with a badass rose on her shoulder!\u201d Lydia says. \u201cThe whole yurt went wild cheering for her! One of our best friends, Henry, got the name Betty in a black heart. Betty is our dog.\u201d", "After the meal, friends Tommy and Dan DJ\u2019d, but Lydia and Roo opted out of doing a first dance. \u201cWe felt like some of those conventions were kinda cheesy and outdated,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did the groom\u2019s speech together, as a couple. We didn\u2019t cut the cake; we just ate it. We did not have a first dance but we did dance a lot\u2014mainly to emo music and Brit pop.\u201d At midnight, some guests had drunken dim sum and found spots on black sheepskins in front of the fire pits, while others continued to party. \u201cRoo and I took a quiet moment in the evening to walk to the riverside and look back at the yurt, glowing in the night, lit up by candles, our friends dancing and singing,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cIt was magical.\u201d"], "summary": "\u201cWe woke up one day, went to design our rings at Shihara studio, grabbed a bowl of ramen, and then spent our engagement night at the Park Hyatt Hotel.\n\u201cThe aesthetic was very much informed by our personal taste, our emo back story, and our Welsh roots,\u201d Lydia explains.\n\u201cMy parents also put a lot of work into making the day really unique,\u201d Lydia says.\n\u201cYou could hear the river flowing and the sun shone really bright that day\u2014unusual for Wales!\u201d Lydia remembers.\nBetty is our dog.\u201dAfter the meal, friends Tommy and Dan DJ\u2019d, but Lydia and Roo opted out of doing a first dance.", "id": "9ce81dd6-6b73-375d-9629-50bb2daa4d41", "title": "The Bride Wore Black at This Wedding in the Wilds of Wales", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "pubDate": null, "url": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/lydia-pang-roo-williams-wedding-wales"}
