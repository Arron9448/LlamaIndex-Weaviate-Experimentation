The documentary \u201cWeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn,\u201d which was released last week, on Hulu, spans 2008 to 2019, a period that technically ended just eighteen months ago. But, at times, watching the documentary feels like watching an account of a distant era\u2014you might as well have turned on Michael Wadleigh\u2019s \u201cWoodstock\u201d or Matt Tyrnauer\u2019s \u201cStudio 54.\u201d WeWork, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, was the startup that pioneered the boom of co-working\u2014that distinctly pre-COVID-19 phenomenon in which freelancers and entrepreneurs paid to spend the workday in shared office spaces, bathing in one anothers\u2019 respiratory droplets. What began as a Brooklyn desk-renting outfit metastasized into Manhattan\u2019s biggest office tenant, reaching a private-market valuation of forty-seven billion dollars, before the whole thing crumpled in a failed I.P.O. attempt.", "The story of WeWork\u2019s rise and fall is the story of the past decade: a strange time when greed, technology worship, and low interest rates combined to produce throngs of supposedly billion-dollar startups, known as \u201cunicorns.\u201d But it is also the story of one man, Adam Neumann, an Israeli immigrant with flowing, dark hair and a habit of walking around barefoot in public. It\u2019s clear that, had Neumann been born a few centuries earlier, he would have made an amazing prophet. But, in 2010, in New York City, he became the next best thing: a founder. The documentary suggests that the two aren\u2019t so different: footage of old-timey faith healers is juxtaposed with scenes of Neumann preaching to starry-eyed millennials. He anoints them, \u201cYou\u2019re a creator! And you\u2019re a creator! And I know you\u2019re a creator!\u201d", "Jed Rothstein, who directed the documentary, is no stranger to religious fervor. The Oscar-nominated filmmaker is known for projects such as \u201cKilling in the Name,\u201d about Al Qaeda, and \u201cGod\u2019s Next Army,\u201d about fundamentalist Christian college students. In \u201cWeWork,\u201d Rothstein sets his sights on the Silicon Valley-inspired prosperity gospel that defines our current era: the dream of \u201cdisrupting\u201d something and becoming a billionaire. It\u2019s a shallow ideology, and, for the most part, Rothstein keeps things light. He sets a brisk pace, works in funny movie references\u2014\u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d \u201cAnimal House\u201d\u2014and gently mocks his subjects with mischievous string music. This isn\u2019t epic, Ken Burns-style storytelling. But it\u2019s a good yarn.", "The film begins during a time of terror and possibility\u2014the stock-market crash of 2008\u2014when an old economic order was vanishing along with the old careers. As Neumann says, in an early promotional video for WeWork investors, one of many that provide fodder for the documentary, \u201cIf you\u2019re twenty-two today and you\u2019re out of college, you can\u2019t go and work for corporate America in the old way, and you need a new solution.\u201d For many people, the solution was to start their own thing\u2014and pray that it would, one day, become the next Amazon, Facebook, or Google.", "WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space, subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. During boom times, it worked great. WeWork could fit more people into its spaces than a regular office. But it carried an obvious risk: What would happen if there was another recession, and the customers went away? WeWork would be stuck paying the rent.", "Other companies have offered flexible office space, most notably Regus, which has been in the business for decades, without anyone getting overly excited about it. (To explain the lack of buzz, we see a snippet from a Regus ad, in which a cheerful businesswoman provides a tour of beige, corporate meeting rooms.) One could argue that WeWork\u2019s biggest innovation was in creating a new workplace aesthetic: casual enough to lure freelancers from coffee shops but more sophisticated than the nerdy playpens of Palo Alto, with their indoor slides and ball pits. A WeWork space resembled a cool person\u2019s living room. Glass walls, exposed brick and concrete, oversized couches, and beer on tap. In the documentary, there\u2019s an amusing roll call of WeWork\u2019s early customers, announcing the names of the companies they were attempting to start there: Yoink. BrunchCritic.com. Spindows. Scruff. Roomhints. These founders\u2014mostly white men and women\u2014wanted a place to work, but they also wanted membership in a club. Or was it a fraternity? One of WeWork\u2019s earliest rituals was an event called Summer Camp, a multiday bacchanal where members indulged in water sports, ropes courses, and semi-clothed games of beer pong. Neumann is the ringmaster of this circus. The endless footage of him partying\u2014crowd-surfing, exchanging chest bumps\u2014becomes a metaphor for his ineffable mojo.", "The company\u2019s story is told by a chorus of ex-employees, customers, and journalists, who agreed to be interviewed for the documentary. (Neumann did not participate.) The scene-stealer ends up being Don Lewis, a former WeWork lawyer with a Brooklyn accent who has a few decades on most of the company\u2019s workforce. He brings a bemused outsider\u2019s perspective to tales about the epic partying\u2014\u201cWhen I say they are serving alcohol, they are serving alcohol! Every fifty yards, there\u2019s a bar set up, and it\u2019s unlimited\u201d\u2014and woo-woo culture. \u201cThey call them C-We-O\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding you.\u2019\u201d", "The attractive young people, the booze, the inspirational mantras\u2014all of it added up to . . . something. What, exactly, kept changing, but Neumann insisted that it was big, and it had something to do with technology. \u201cSo we\u2019re definitely not a real-estate company,\u201d he tells a skeptical television interviewer. \u201cWe are a community of creators\u201d who \u201cleverage technology to connect people. . . . And it\u2019s a new way of working. Just like Uber is the sharing economy for cars, and Citibike for bicycles, we\u2019re the sharing economy for space.\u201d (WeWork wasn\u2019t really an economy\u2014it was more of a landlord\u2014but, as Reeves Wiedeman explains in his book about Neumann, \u201cBillion Dollar Loser,\u201d the dream in Silicon Valley is to build \u201cplatforms\u201d with \u201cnetwork effects,\u201d a formula for exponential growth.) In the interview, Neumann is flanked by the real-estate mogul Mortimer Zuckerman, one of WeWork\u2019s investors, who declares that he\u2019s \u201cmade a judgment as to this man\u2019s leadership capabilities,\u201d and that everything checks out.", "Zuckerman is the first in a parade of moneymen who are shown fawning over Neumann and his vision, from the storied venture capitalists at Benchmark to Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, whom Neumann calls his \u201cpersonal banker.\u201d (According to the Wall Street Journal, Dimon was so inspired after Neumann took him on a tour of WeWork buildings that he ripped up plans for his bank\u2019s new offices and handed the design contract over to WeWork.) The film tracks the funders\u2019 enthusiasm with graphics depicting the company\u2019s exploding valuation: in 2013, it\u2019s $1.6 billion; by 2016, it had soared almost to seventeen billion dollars, and Neumann was flying around the world on a company jet. On camera, he was saying things like \u201cWe are definitely turning a profit. I\u2019m bored of the businesses that don\u2019t turn a profit.\u201d Behind the scenes, the company was hemorrhaging money, losing so much that it had to lay off part of its workforce. And yet investors kept handing him funds and bidding up the price.", "How does this happen? Rothstein doesn\u2019t land any interviews with the big-name investors themselves. And he offers a fairly cursory explanation for Neumann\u2019s ability to seduce them, suggesting that they were motivated by FOMO, the fear of missing out on the next Airbnb or Uber. But I found myself craving a deeper understanding\u2014especially because the story doesn\u2019t stop with WeWork or Neumann. It\u2019s part of a rash of tales about grifts and cons that have proliferated and then ended up onscreen over the past few years, from \u201cThe Vow,\u201d about the NXIVM cult, which ensnared many wealthy and successful people, to \u201cOperation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal\u201d and multiple documentaries about the Fyre Festival.", "Perhaps the most obvious analogue to the WeWork story is that of Theranos, the blood-testing company that followed a similar trajectory (charismatic founder, media hype, multi-billion-dollar valuation) before collapsing in 2018, when its miraculous technology was revealed to be a fraud. \u201cThe Inventor,\u201d Alex Gibney\u2019s 2019 documentary about the company and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was a darker film, in part because the stakes are higher in medical testing than they are in co-working, and because Holmes\u2019s deception was even more extreme than Neumann\u2019s. But Gibney\u2019s film delves into the psychology of investing, including interviews with the behavioral economist Dan Ariely, who points out that, contrary to what they might tell themselves, investors are motivated by stories as much as they are by data. (The origin of the word \u201ccreditor\u201d is credere, which is Latin for \u201cbelieve.\u201d) Rothstein\u2019s WeWork documentary could have benefitted from more interviews with such experts. Otherwise, you might be tempted to conclude that the world\u2019s billionaires are just stupid\u2014which might be true, but it can\u2019t explain everything.", "I called up Ariely to ask him about WeWork. He brought up motivated reasoning, the human tendency to persuade ourselves of any story we want to believe in. After we adopt a world view, we seek out information that reinforces it, and it becomes stronger. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeding proposition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bubbles happen. If I heard that Jamie Dimon invested in a startup, I think I\u2019d do less due diligence before investing. And now somebody else says, \u2018Hey, Jamie Dimon and Dan Ariely are investors. We\u2019ll do even less due diligence.\u2019 \u201d", "He also pointed out the importance of a \u201clens,\u201d a theory that allows people to tell themselves that \u201cthe old rules don\u2019t apply.\u201d For example, the idea that WeWork isn\u2019t a real-estate company\u2014it\u2019s the sharing economy for space. Or \u201cCommunity Adjusted EBITDA,\u201d the special financial metrics that WeWork used to transform its losses into profits, and which Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at N.Y.U., describes in the documentary as a \u201cconsensual hallucination.\u201d In one funny scene, Lewis, the street-smart lawyer, recalls a revival-like WeWork gathering at a New York event space. An African-American usher asks him, \u201cBrother \u2026 is this some kind of cult?\u201d"], "authors": ["Lizzie Widdicombe", "Lizzie Widdicomb", "Charles Duhig"], "keywords": ["investors", "weworks", "documentary", "company", "neumann", "space", "office", "explores", "delusion", "wework", "decade", "billion", "youre"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
