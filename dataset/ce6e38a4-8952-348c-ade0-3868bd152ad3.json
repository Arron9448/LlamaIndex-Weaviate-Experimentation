His \u201cwild childhood\u201d eventually saw him being sent to a correctional wilderness camp and, later, a \u201csecond chance\u201d boarding school in Sewanee, Tennessee. It was in this small town, also home to a liberal-arts college, that he got his first taste of knitting from a local instructor, an older woman whom he would assist. \u201cThis was what really shaped a lot of my aesthetic and my interest in craft and community,\u201d says Averett. \u201cShe planted that seed.\u201d His instructor, who has since passed away, sent Averett a knitted swatch, a talismanic piece that he carries with him to photo shoots to this day.", "That homespun effect is part of the charm in Averett\u2019s clothes. While his designs are polished and elevated, there is a craft appeal to his pieces\u2014think wrap-you-up comfort, but with a chic, Zoom-\u00adworthy punch. He chalks the latter up to his talent for working his mistakes into something, well, beautiful. \u201cKnitwear isn\u2019t laser-cut or so specific as making something with leather, or even a shirt,\u201d he says. \u201cIf something comes in wrong, it\u2019s often good to work with the mistakes and then watch what possibilities unfold from that.\u201d", "Averett produces many of his pieces in Brooklyn\u2014not boho, L-train Brooklyn but, rather, a Russian-centric pocket of far-flung Bay Ridge. When he first graduated from Parsons, Averett was trained by Vlad, a former Bolshoi Ballet dancer who had learned how to knit and who introduced Averett to a clan of female-led Soviet-born knitters. \u201cThey bring a European sensibility from the \u201980s that is very wanted right now,\u201d says Averett. He shows off a black crocheted merino-wool dress made by one of them, whose bobble-stitch technique is reminiscent of pearls. During lockdown, Averett had been getting his team together under unusual circumstances\u2014masked while in the open air, and very much in public. \u201cWe\u2019d meet at Bryant Park or Madison Square Garden,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish there was footage, because we were pulling all these pieces out and I was trying them on. If I was a bigger brand, that would be a no-go!\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d"], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["oldworld", "knitwear", "cool", "contemporary", "small", "averett", "town", "really", "meet", "judy", "mistakes", "turner", "lot", "label", "traditions", "pieces", "instructor", "sent"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
