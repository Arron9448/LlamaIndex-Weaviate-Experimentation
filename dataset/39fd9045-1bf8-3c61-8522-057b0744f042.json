The most pervasive forms of local advertising often feel like this\u2014like nursery rhymes or urban legends, or something implanted in your most tender consciousness by a social version of natural law. When Texans hear the name Jim Adler, their souls reply with \u201cTexas Hammer.\u201d Michiganders know that God filled the sky around the Detroit airport with clouds and with billboards for Joumana Kayrouz. New Yorkers know the Cellino & Barnes hotline better than they know their Social Security numbers. And, for many Americans who live in or around the ninety-six cities where the Shen Yun Performing Arts troupe is set to perform this year, the words \u201cShen Yun\u201d conjure an indelible yet incomprehensible image: a flat, bright shade of lilac, a woman leaping in the sky with a fan-shaped white skirt and billowing pink sleeves, and the enigmatic phrase \u201c5,000 Years of Civilization Reborn.\u201d Shen Yun has lived in the pink fluffy insulation of my mind for a while now. Last year, the ads were goldenrod yellow, like dehydrated urine, and they said \u201cReviving 5,000 Years of Civilization.\u201d The year before that, the ads (\u201cExperience a Divine Culture\u201d) were green. The year before that, the Shen Yun poster featured two women dancing, wearing birthday-cake-frosting colors, and for months I sat in the subway reading but in no way processing the phrase \u201cAbsolutely the No. 1 show in the world.\u201d These posters were so uncanny and contentless that the easiest explanation for their existence was that my brain had simply glitched and invented Shen Yun the way John Nash invented his roommate in \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d Shen Yun was a Baader-Meinhof object: once I saw it, I started to see it everywhere. Shen Yun greeted me silently at the bus stop and loomed over highway exits, following me around on the physical plane of existence the way anything you shop for on the Internet starts to follow you around online. Then, over the holidays, I went home to Houston, where my parents live. On Christmas Day, my dad told me that he had something special planned for the family. \u201cIt\u2019s this show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be spectacular. It\u2019s called Shen Yun.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d I said. \u201cMike and Lilly saw it,\u201d my dad said. \u201cThey said it was beautiful.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s real?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d my dad said. \u201cIt\u2019s dancing. Beautiful . . . dancing. Really fabulous, traditional dancing.\u201d \u201cIs it like Cirque du Soleil?\u201d I asked, furiously Googling Shen Yun on my phone, something that had never occurred to me to do before. (Why look up a figment of your own imagination?) I was seeing a lot of search results that involved the word \u201ccult.\u201d I clicked on one link, and then closed it, realizing that I did not want to spoil what lay ahead of me\u2014a free journey into the fantastic unknown. On the day of Shen Yun, I developed chills and a fever, which I immediately decided to ignore in the interest of seeing Shen Yun. My family drove to the fancy concert hall downtown, where the lobby was full of people in suits and cocktail dresses. After we took our seats, two hosts with animatronic smiles, speaking both Chinese and English, began introducing a series of dances, which were called things like \u201cGoodness in the Face of Evil\u201d and \u201cThe World Divinely Restored.\u201d The female dancers moved in hypnotic swirls; the male dancers jumped and flipped. Behind the stage was an enormous screen upon which digital backdrops\u2014ancient temples, royal gardens, the cosmos\u2014appeared, along with digital dancers who would walk to the bottom of the screen and then pop out, via the appearance of a living dancer, on the stage. The colors were near-neon and unnatural; they reminded me of the glowing hues of Photo Hunt, the tabletop bar game. The hosts started talking about a spiritual discipline called Falun Dafa, and then introduced a dance in which a beautiful young follower of Falun Dafa was kidnapped and imprisoned by Communists, who harvested her organs. \u201cI\u2019m hallucinating,\u201d I whispered to my brother in the dark. \u201cWould everyone like to learn a little Chinese?\u201d one of the hosts asked. He intoned a phrase and asked the audience to repeat it. \u201cThat phrase means \u2018I love Shen Yun,\u2019 \u201d he said. I felt my forehead. The dances continued, sleeves swirling, skirts rippling. A man came onstage to sing a song in Chinese, which was translated on the screen behind him. \u201cWe follow Dafa, the Great Way,\u201d he began, singing about a Creator who saved mankind and made the world anew. \u201cAtheism and evolution are deadly ideas. Modern trends destroy what makes us human,\u201d he sang. At the end of the song, the row of older white people sitting behind me clapped fervently. In the final dance number, a group of Falun Dafa followers, who wore blue and yellow and clutched books of religious teachings, battled for space in a public square with corrupt youth. (Their corruption was evident because they were wearing black, looking at their cell phones, and, in the case of two men, holding hands.) Chairman Mao appeared, and the sky turned black; the city in the digital backdrop was obliterated by an earthquake, then finished off by a Communist tsunami. A red hammer and sickle glowed in the center of the wave. Dazed, I rubbed my eyes and saw a huge, bearded face disappearing in the water. \u201cWas that . . . ?\u201d I said to my brother, wondering if I needed to go to the hospital. \u201cKarl Marx?\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I think that was a tsunami with the face of Karl Marx.\u201d", "Aside from the organ harvesting, the homophobia, the anti-evolution ballad, and the Karl Marx apparition, the thing I found most odd about my Shen Yun experience in Houston was the hosts\u2019 explanation of Chinese classical dance. This art form seemed to resemble both ballet and gymnastics, they said, but, they explained, ballet and gymnastics had in fact borrowed the traditional techniques of Chinese classical dance. The dancers were showcasing a tradition that was thousands of years old, they went on\u2014a tradition that had been single-handedly rejuvenated by Shen Yun. It was impossible to see a show like this in China, because of the Communist regime, they told us. In February, I called up Emily Wilcox, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Michigan and the author of the book \u201cRevolutionary Bodies: Chinese Dance and the Socialist Legacy.\u201d \u201cI studied Chinese classical dance at the Beijing Dance Academy for a year and a half,\u201d she said, \u201cand, a few weeks after I came back to Michigan, a group promoting Shen Yun came up to me at the mall, handed me a flyer, and gave me the whole spiel about how Chinese dance is banned in China. It was hilarious to me, and so ridiculous, and, in a way, it inspired me to write this history in my book.\u201d Wilcox told me that Chinese classical dance is one of the predominant forms of dance in the contemporary Chinese art world. \u201cIt\u2019s the form that professional dancers pay most attention to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, crucially, it\u2019s actually a very new art form.\u201d In the early nineteen-fifties, Wilcox explained, Chinese dancers, driven by a nationalistic impulse to create a form that could truly represent China, and drawing inspiration from historic art objects, nineteen-twenties Chinese opera, and various types of folk performance, began to shape a new tradition. \u201cDancers in China emphasize the fact that Chinese dance is an artistic innovation,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in the possibility of newness, diversity, finding something new in Chinese history rather than re-creating the same thing.\u201d \u201cHave you ever heard anyone say that ballet or gymnastics came out of Chinese dance?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have never heard that before, no,\u201d Wilcox said. She then pointed me to several Chinese-classical-dance performances on YouTube, all of which were markedly more expressive and nuanced than what I saw at Shen Yun. In the book \u201cContemporary Directions in Asian-American Dance,\u201d Yutian Wong notes that the glowing profiles Shen Yun publishes about its dancers \u201cconsist of stories in which former Chinese nationals can only discover the essence of Chinese culture by learning and performing classical Chinese dance choreography outside of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d Shen Yun insists that it is a singular source of generative purity\u2014that five thousand years of culture were reborn in upstate New York in 2006. Wong suggests that Shen Yun\u2019s claims to purity are a way for Falun Gong practitioners to reclaim their identity from persecution\u2014and that they\u2019re bolstered by a pre\u00ebxisting tendency on the part of Western audiences to perceive Asian bodies, and Asian culture, as \u201cauthentic.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/stepping-into-the-uncanny-unsettling-world-of-shen-yun", "id": "39fd9045-1bf8-3c61-8522-057b0744f042", "title": "Stepping Into the Uncanny, Unsettling World of Shen Yun", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["Jia Tolentino", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous"], "summary": "On the day of Shen Yun, I developed chills and a fever, which I immediately decided to ignore in the interest of seeing Shen Yun.\n\u201cWe follow Dafa, the Great Way,\u201d he began, singing about a Creator who saved mankind and made the world anew.\nThis art form seemed to resemble both ballet and gymnastics, they said, but, they explained, ballet and gymnastics had in fact borrowed the traditional techniques of Chinese classical dance.\n\u201cDancers in China emphasize the fact that Chinese dance is an artistic innovation,\u201d Wilcox said.\nShe then pointed me to several Chinese-classical-dance performances on YouTube, all of which were markedly more expressive and nuanced than what I saw at Shen Yun.", "pubDate": null}
