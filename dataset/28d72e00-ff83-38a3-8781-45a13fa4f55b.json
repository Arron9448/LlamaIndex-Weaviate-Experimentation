With more than six million copies sold worldwide, many trainers have been journeying through the Galar region looking for more to do. During today's Pok\u00e9mon Direct presentation, The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo announced new DLC for Sword & Shield in the form of two expansions that make up an Expansion Pass.", "The two expansions are called The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra. Both expansions bring a new area to explore, new Pok\u00e9mon to catch, new clothes to equip to your trainer, and new features. In addition to more than a hundred new clothing items added across the expansions, new items like the leveling item Exp. Charm and new tutor moves will add new wrinkles never before seen in mainline Pok\u00e9mon games. A new battle type called Restricted Sparring also appears in The Isle of Armor, where trainers can only use certain Pok\u00e9mon types or must battle under specific conditions.", "Each expansion also has its own Pok\u00e9dex to complete, and in turn, expands the Galar Pok\u00e9dex with more all-new Pok\u00e9mon, as well as more returning monsters. Additionally, while in the expansion areas, players can complete Max Raid Battles against Pok\u00e9mon not in Galar's Wild Area. Players can invite up to three friends to battle alongside them; you can even invite friends who don't own the Expansion Pass to hop into these battles.", "The Isle of Armor is described as a giant island with environments unlike what is seen in Galar including beaches, forests, bogs, caves, and sand dunes. As expected, the Isle is home to a ton of Pok\u00e9mon, several of which were not present in Sword & Shield's base game. While on the Isle of Armor, players find a dojo that specializes in a particular style of training. Trainers become become the apprentice of Mustard, a legendary trainer who held championship for 18 consecutive years \u2013 even reaching back to before Dynamaxing was a part of Pok\u00e9mon League battles.", "Later in the year, players can travel to the Crown Tundra, a beautiful, mountainous landscape covered in snow. During this adventure, the trainer is appointed the leader of an exploration team to investigate the far corners of this frozen area. In The Crown Tundra expansion, players can even explore the depths of Pok\u00e9mon Dens, which we've only seen the outside of in the Wild Area during Max Raid Battles to this point. These Dens not only deliver new gameplay features, but also allow players to encounter Legendary Pok\u00e9mon from past generations.", "A major sticking point for some Pok\u00e9mon fans going into Sword & Shield is how the games did not include a chunk of past creatures in the title. Through the new Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra locations, several past Pok\u00e9mon make their way into Sword & Shield. In addition, all players will receive a free update to coincide with the launches of these expansions to enable them to receive these returning Pok\u00e9mon through means such as trading or the Pok\u00e9mon Home cloud service, which is set to launch in February. Pok\u00e9mon Home will also enable players to bring these past Pok\u00e9mon into Pok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield as long as they appear in these expansions.", "New Pok\u00e9mon Incoming Along with the two new expansions, players can encounter even more new Pok\u00e9mon through the new locations. You can learn more about some of these new creatures below. Kubfu (Fighting Type)", "Appearing in the Isle of Armor expansion, Kubfu is a Pok\u00e9mon that lived in the Galar region long ago, but now lives up in the mountains away from the region. After sufficient training, Kubfu evolves into Urshifu, which has two separate forms. The Single Strike Style Urshifu is a Fighting/Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon that is more focused on power, while the Rapid Strike Style Urshifu is a Fighting/Water-type Pok\u00e9mon with an emphasis on evasiveness and flowing movements. Both forms of Urshifu can Gigantamax. Calyrex (Psychic/Grass Type)", "Calyrex is encountered in The Crown Tundra expansion. Known as \"The King Pok\u00e9mon,\" this creature ruled Galar in ancient times. Calyrex is graceful, intelligent, and is said to have seen everything that has ever happened, is currently happening, and will happen in the future. Galarian Slowpoke (Psychic Type)", "Slowpoke is not exactly a newcomer to Pok\u00e9mon trainers, but this new form specific to Galar puts a new twist on a familiar, dopey face. This new form is the result of Slowpoke eating seeds of a plant specific to the Galar region, which caused it to build up particles of the spice over generations and gain a new appearance and behavior set. As you might suspect, Galarian Slowpoke can evolve into Galarian Slowbro or Galarian Slowking. You can only achieve this using items found in the new expansion regions; an item on the Isle of Armor lets you evolve Galarian Slowpoke into Galarian Slowbro, while an item in the Crown Tundra turns Galarian Slowpoke into Galarian Slowking. Gigantamaxed Starters", "In addition to these new Pok\u00e9mon and regional forms, the evolved forms of the three starter Pok\u00e9mon will gain the ability to Gigantamax through the expansions. This means you can expect to see massive, powerful new forms for Rillaboom, Cinderace, and Inteleon once the Isle of Armor expansion releases.", "In addition, Pok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield receives an update today that gives all players a sneak peek at expansion content. Once the update is installed, players can go to Wedgehurst Station, where they'll meet a new rival from the expansions. Sword players can encounter Poison-type trainer Klara, while Shield players meet Psychic-type trainer Avery. In addition, players can add Galarian Slowpoke to their collection. This update is available free to all players, regardless of if they have the Expansion Pass or not.", "Players use the same save file to access these expansions as they do the main game, and the new areas can be accessed at nearly any time during the course of the adventure \u2013 all you need is to have reached the Wild Area in order to access the new content.", "The Isle of Armor expansion is set to release in June, while The Crown Tundra will hit in fall of this year. Both expansions are included in the Pok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield Expansion Passes, which cost $29.99. Players can pre-purchase the Expansion Pass on the eShop starting today. Those who purchase the Expansion Pass receive Pikachu and Eevee-themed uniforms for use in Sword & Shield."], "authors": ["Digital Editor", "Brian Has Written About Video Games For Over A Decade Across Multiple Publications.
