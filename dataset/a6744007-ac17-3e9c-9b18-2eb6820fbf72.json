Each year\u2019s start is cause for celebration, but this time around, the collective desire for joy was especially palpable. That spirit was evident in the fashion celebrities chose to mark the milestone. Sure, the traditions of champagne-filled parties and a jam-packed Times Square may be on hold, but stars were intent on channeling that exuberance with their clothes. On the annual Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve special, Jennifer Lopez gave Pierpaolo Piccioli\u2019s towering Valentino Haute Couture marabou feather coat a thrilling debut. Ever the showman, J.Lo wore the piece and its mile-long train as she sang \u2018In the Morning\u2019 while perched atop a tiered platform. Finishing the look off with a diamond mask, she reached new heights of glamour\u2014pun intended.", "At the Jiangsu TV New Year's Gala, Chinese pop superstar Chris Lee provided her version of festive, feathered couture. Dressed in an all-white creation from Tony Ward, Lee commanded the stage at one of the world\u2019s most-watched entertainment shows. With a sculptural hat, peplum, and flared pants all competing for attention, Lee\u2019s outfit could have been overwrought. However, its minimalist color palette kept attention focused on the look\u2019s elegant silhouette and overarching drama.", "Even those who weren\u2019t headlining a bash got in on the action. In Aspen, where the Kardashian-Jenner clan has been enjoying the slopes and all manner of apr\u00e9s ski fashion, Kylie and Kendall Jenner offered two takes on seasonal outerwear. In a glossy chocolate version of Saks Potts\u2019s signature \u201cBonnie\u201d coat and Charlotte Knowles\u2019s psychedelic print trousers, Kylie gave the city a street style moment while dashing to her car with her mother, Kris. Kendall went in a different, but no less chic, direction in chunky Prada boots, black leggings, and sleek overcoat from The Row. Elegant, minimal, and practical, Jenner\u2019s off-duty outfit was precisely the kind of look we expect to see more of in 2021."], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["gave", "best", "2021", "lee", "week", "set", "kendall", "fashion", "tone", "version", "outfit", "kylie", "stars", "elegant", "look", "couture", "dressed"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
