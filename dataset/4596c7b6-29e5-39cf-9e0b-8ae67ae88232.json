Timeless, to the Vogue contributing editor, doesn\u2019t mean expensive. Nor does it mean only home items bought by your mother, your grandmother, and maybe even your great-grandmother. \u201cIt\u2019s brands that should be part of everyone\u2019s life when they try to build a home together with someone,\u201d Macon says. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a mix of things\u2014everything from niche artisanal items, to tried and true brands, to objects that can be passed down for generations.\u201d", "So, together with former Moda Operandi buyer Emilie Ghilaga\u2014and the boutique design studio and digital agency Gadabout Creative\u2014Over The Moon has created a platform that will help couples find brands that fit that chic-yet-classic criteria. Registry users can technically add a product from any e-commerce site to their registry. But Over The Moon is also there to give you stylish suggestions on which things, exactly, should be your everlasting asks. That could include anything from colorful Le Creuset Kitchenware, to Laguna B glasses, to Pomelo Casa plates and pitchers, and maternity clothes for those who are looking further into the future. \u201cWe wanted to share so many things we found from our own research that are beautiful and truly special,\u201d Macon says.", "Their hope? A registry experience that feels less sterile and more like you. Sure, picking out dish towels isn\u2019t terribly exciting. But when those dish towels are monogrammable, made by a local artisan, and adorned with a playful white fringe, they may actually spark a bit of joy. (Plus, Macon and Ghilaga will also allow users to add non-home items to their list. Want a pair of earrings for your rehearsal dinner? Want contributions towards a stay at the Hotel il Pellicano, the Italian honeymoon haunt of your dreams, rather than a blender? All possibilities with Over The Moon.) You\u2019ll also be able to customize your registry page with colors, illustrations, and images, making sure your personal style shines through.", "Tablescape selections from Over the Moon. Photo: By Corey Tenold", "Alongside the abundance of pretty things, the registry is also deeply practical. There\u2019s a thank you note tracker that helps organize what offering came from Uncle Mike versus Aunt Pam. Then, there's an option to convert gifts into cash. \u201cLet\u2019s say somebody gives you 10 plates. But then you actually don't want the plates because you're moving into a different house or an apartment, and they just don't work; you can turn those into funds and buy something else,\u201d Macon explains.", "After a (mostly) wedding-less year in 2020, late 2021 and 2022 promises a boom of I-dos. And, for the betrothed, there\u2019s now an easy and effortlessly chic way get organized as the big day finally approaches."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["things", "makes", "theres", "users", "towels", "curate", "registry", "brands", "easy", "plates", "wedding", "moon", "items", "macon", "practical", "stylish"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
