Beware of those who lorded their smarts over you, was the warning. Don\u2019t fall for their high-toned airs.", "Since I\u2019ve been lucky enough to get a fancy enough education, I\u2019ve often found myself on the other side of that warning. But then came Jan. 6, when I watched my Ivy League-educated senator, Ted Cruz, try to pull yet another fast one on the American people as he fought \u2014 not long before the certification process was disrupted by a mob of Trump supporters storming the Capitol and forcing their way into the Senate chamber \u2014 to challenge the election results.", "In the unctuous, patronizing style he is famous for, Mr. Cruz cited the aftermath of the 1876 presidential election between Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden. It was contentious and involved actual disputes about voter fraud and electoral mayhem, and a committee was formed to sort it out. Mr. Cruz\u2019s idea was to urge the creation of a committee to investigate invented claims of widespread voter fraud \u2014 figments of the imaginations of Mr. Trump and minions like Mr. Cruz \u2014 in the election of Joe Biden. It was, for Mr. Cruz, a typical, too-clever-by-half bit of nonsense, a cynical ploy to paper over the reality of his subversion on behalf of President Trump.

It happened, for instance, after he supported a lawsuit from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (under indictment since 2015 for securities fraud) in an attempt to overturn election results in critical states (it was supported by other Texan miscreants like Representative Louie Gohmert)."], "authors": ["Mimi Swartz"], "keywords": ["warning", "ted", "states", "opinion", "voter", "supported", "cruz", "fraud", "ivy", "forget", "mr", "election", "trump"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
