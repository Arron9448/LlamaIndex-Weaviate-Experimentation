Yet the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise has not been nearly the success story for its owner, Disney, as its other blockbuster factory, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which this year produced the highest-grossing film of all time, \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d. The story of why that may be is worth telling, because getting \u201cStar Wars\u201d right would further Disney\u2019s long-term ambitions across its businesses, from toys and theme parks to its latest endeavour, streaming television.", "Granted, Disney\u2019s returns from \u201cStar Wars\u201d would be the envy of any Hollywood studio. Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the franchise\u2019s owner, from its creator, George Lucas, for $4.1bn in 2012. The four \u201cStar Wars\u201d films it has made since then have grossed nearly $5bn in ticket sales. Disney has also hauled in billions in sales of merchandise, theme-park passes and promotional tie-ins. It created a live-action \u201cStar Wars\u201d television series, \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d, to launch its new streaming service, Disney+.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "But unlike the Marvel films, which have generally grown more successful with each instalment, the trajectory of \u201cStar Wars\u201d under Disney has been rocky. The first part of the new Skywalker trilogy, \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d, released in 2015, earned $2.1bn at the box office (then the third-highest total in history) and an astounding reported profit of $780m. But the second, \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d, took in 36% less at the box office (and was about half as profitable, say industry sources). And although Disney\u2019s first \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff film, \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d, was the second-biggest-grossing movie of 2016, the second, \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d, released two years later, reportedly lost $77m (the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d film to lose money). Toy sales have also dropped since 2015; Hasbro attributed a sales slump in 2017 to weaker \u201cStar Wars\u201d trade than expected.", "The downward trajectory has continued. \u201cGalaxy\u2019s Edge\u201d, a theme-park attraction that was years in the making, has failed to draw the hoped-for huge crowds, a rare miss for Disney. And after the failure of \u201cSolo\u201d Bob Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, announced a hiatus in \u201cStar Wars\u201d films after \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d completes the trilogy. Mr Iger has said the company moved too fast in churning out \u201cStar Wars\u201d films; after \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d, there will not be another \u201cStar Wars\u201d theatrical release for at least three years, and possibly longer.", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe, in contrast, has been an increasingly reliable money machine since its first film, \u201cIron Man\u201d, appeared in 2008. Only one of the sequels has failed to outperform its predecessor at the box office. And Marvel is stepping up the pace of production: in 2019 it released three films; in 2021 it will release four. Why has \u201cStar Wars\u201d not done as well?", "One reason is mismanagement. Mr Iger has said that Disney tried to do too much too quickly. Across the five films made so far (including \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d), five directors were fired or in effect replaced. Two of the pictures required expensive reshoots. At least two films were pushed back six months from their initial release dates. A planned trilogy by Rian Johnson, director of \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d, seems to have been shelved. Another set of three, from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, was cancelled in October (though this was partly attributable to their decision to sign a lucrative development deal with Netflix). The Marvel Cinematic Universe, by comparison, was carefully plotted years in advance over the course of the past decade. It has seen no such redos.", "Another possible reason is that \u201cStar Wars\u201d has not travelled as well as Marvel\u2019s superhero films. China, now the world\u2019s second-largest cinema market, has proven especially difficult terrain. The first three \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, released between 1977 and 1983, were not shown in Chinese theatres. The prequel trilogy, which spanned 1999 to 2005, was released before China\u2019s cinema-going boom. As a result, Chinese audiences\u2019 first real exposure to \u201cStar Wars\u201d in the cinema was \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d, the seventh entry in the Skywalker saga. By then the mythology had already become quite complex (and the original heroes very old). Disney\u2019s spinoff films were also both prequels to the film of 1977.", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe, meanwhile, came along as the Chinese cinema business was taking off. \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d took in $660m in ticket sales in China in 2019, making it the fourth-most successful film in the country\u2019s history. It also outperformed the previous \u201cAvengers\u201d film, \u201cInfinity War\u201d, by 77%. \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d yielded just $125m in ticket sales, and each subsequent \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie made less. \u201cSolo\u201d bombed in China as it did elsewhere, bringing in only $16m.", "Yet there is still plenty of hope for the franchise. With its new films, Disney made a concerted effort to bring more diversity to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe. The ostensible hero of the franchise is now a woman. Her co-stars are black, Guatemalan-American and Vietnamese-American. The core of these films\u2014the tension and conflict between Jedi warrior Rey and evil Sith aspirant Kylo Ren\u2014is a compelling human drama. \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d has also shown that Star Wars can tell much smaller stories than those of galaxy-wide good and evil, as well as stories not about the Skywalker family. A supporting character in the show, \u201cBaby Yoda\u201d (so dubbed by audiences), is one of Google\u2019s most queried terms in America of 2019\u2014even though it did not appear on screen until November.", "As Yoda might say, a bright future, Disney still can see. Disney+, the streaming service, allows it to establish a direct relationship with \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans, making sudden hits like \u201cBaby Yoda\u201d more valuable than they would have been in an earlier era. It introduces more young viewers to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe (they can watch the other films on Disney+), and to toys, theme parks and the rest of Disney\u2019s wares. And Disney+ also can introduce fans of all its other content, including Marvel and Pixar films and the animated classics, to \u201cStar Wars\u201d.", "But a brief pause in production, as Mr Iger announced, is probably wise. Disney and Lucasfilm can learn from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films they have made so far, take time to plan entirely new stories and revitalise the franchise. Audiences will still be there. There is a popular adage that \u201cno one hates \u2018Star Wars\u2019 more than \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fans\u201d. With that kind of passion, the Force should remain strong with Disney for a long time to come."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "title": "Will \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d rebalance Disney\u2019s universe?", "pubDate": null, "summary": "THIS WEEK \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\u201d will dominate the global box office, and will probably delight fans across the galaxy.\nAnd although Disney\u2019s first \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff film, \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d, was the second-biggest-grossing movie of 2016, the second, \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d, released two years later, reportedly lost $77m (the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d film to lose money).\nMr Iger has said the company moved too fast in churning out \u201cStar Wars\u201d films; after \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d, there will not be another \u201cStar Wars\u201d theatrical release for at least three years, and possibly longer.\nWith its new films, Disney made a concerted effort to bring more diversity to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe.\nThere is a popular adage that \u201cno one hates \u2018Star Wars\u2019 more than \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fans\u201d.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/12/16/will-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rebalance-disneys-universe"}
