It looked at what had caused a surge in employment in America over the previous year. The jobs boom coincided with a cold-hearted Republican reform to make unemployment benefits less generous. The authors demonstrated, convincingly, that the one had caused the other, with the benefit cut leading to the creation of 1.8m extra jobs in 2014\u2014about two-thirds of the total.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Nobody nowadays wins election by promising to lavish the unemployed with public funds. So it is surprising to find that the country with the world\u2019s most generous offer to the out-of-work also has one of its best-functioning labour markets.", "Danish benefits are worth more than 80% of previous earnings after six months out of work, compared with 60% across the rich world and less than 50% in Britain (America is even stingier). For Danish parents who lose their jobs, replacement rates can approach 100%.", "The generosity of Denmark\u2019s unemployment system is the flipside of its liberal regulation of employment contracts\u2014a combination called \u201cflexicurity\u201d. Danish employers can hire and fire workers pretty much as they please. Jobs therefore come and go, but people\u2019s incomes are stable. Yet the state\u2019s munificence has not produced a class of feckless drifters. Denmark\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than the rich-world average and its working-age employment rate is higher. Long-term unemployment is low. When Danish people lose a job, they find a new one faster than almost anyone else in the world, according to the OECD . That is because Denmark makes it hard for people to live off welfare. Recipients must submit a CV to a coach within two weeks of becoming unemployed. They can be struck off for not trying hard enough to search for work or to keep up with adult-education programmes. As a share of GDP Denmark spends four times as much as the average OECD country, and more than any single one, on \u201cactive labour-market policies\u201d to make people more employable. This offers a tough lesson for those arguing for more generous welfare states. Simply boosting benefits may dissuade employment, as it did in America before 2014. To stop this happening requires massive investment in training, monitoring and enforcement of the rules for those out of work\u2014spending money to avoid wasting it, in other words. The world\u2019s best welfare system does not come cheap.
