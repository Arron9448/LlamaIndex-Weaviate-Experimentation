But the short clip omits Biden\u2019s larger argument over how Ryan handled the 2017 tax cuts and subsequent budget debates.", "A separate Sanders\u2019 adviser included a transcript of Biden\u2019s remarks in the video clip in a separate campaign newsletter. He added other, more extended video, of Biden as a US senator in 1995 and presidential candidate in 2007 explaining his support for a more austere federal budget, including putting Social Security and Medicare \u201con the table\u201d.", "The 2020 campaign flap highlights long-standing philosophical fissures between the progressive Sanders, who has spent decades arguing for a massive expansion of the federal government, and the more centrist Biden. Those differences have come to the fore as Biden and Sanders are bunched with Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren atop early state polls weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.", "Responding to Biden\u2019s remarks, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said: \u201cJoe Biden should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.", "\u201cThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security \u2013 he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions,\u201d Shakir said in a statement.", "\u201cThe vice-president must stop dodging questions about his record, and start explaining why he has so aggressively pushed to slash one of the most significant and successful social programs in American history, which millions of Americans rely on for survival.\u201d", "In a 1 January tweet, Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels wrote that it \u201cis soul-wrenching\u201d to have heard \u201cBiden say \u2018Ryan was correct\u2019.\u201d He attached a 20-second video clip taken from an April 2018 speech Biden delivered at the Brookings Institution.", "\u201cPaul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code.

That\u2019s the only way you can find room to pay for it.\u201c", "It was part of a broader speech in which Biden outlined his economic vision. He previewed his 2020 campaign emphasis on the middle class but declared that billionaires are not \u201cthe problem\u201d, an implicit contrast with progressives.", "The statement that Gunnels highlighted reflects a common Biden argument from the 2020 campaign: that Republicans pushed a tax cut whose benefits are tilted to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, knowing it would balloon the deficits, so the GOP could then justify cutting Social Security and Medicare.", "\u201cWhat I\u2019d do is I make sure that we expand Social Security coverage,\u201d Biden insisted on Friday when a voter in Iowa asked him about the program.", "Biden, like most Democrats, proposes raising the cap on the level of income that is subject to the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. That cap is set at $137,700 for the current tax year, meaning any income beyond that threshold is still subject to personal income tax, but not payroll taxes. Biden, and many other Democrats, propose lifting that cap to increase the tax revenue flowing into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds.", "Impeachment: is Trump set to survive and win a second term?

I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\u201d", "Just as the Biden campaign argues that Republicans would lambaste the Vermont senator as a socialist if he wins the Democratic nomination, Sanders\u2019 backers retort that Trump would use the same video clips they cite to harm Biden with older voters who will prove critical in battleground states in November."], "authors": ["Associated Press In Washington"], "keywords": ["video", "campaign", "biden", "tax", "security", "disown", "social", "sanders", "tried", "medicare", "calls", "doctored", "ryan"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
