One will have a red that goes slightly towards pink or cherry; another will have a sort of Ferrari red. This factory will make that red and that factory will make this red,\u201d she says. Sersale ended up developing many of her own colors, but explains it\u2019s rare for Murano glassmakers to veer from their playbook. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a new shape, it takes time and effort, and workshops tend to be suspicious that you might make them lose time.\u201d", "Through Sersale\u2019s experience sourcing finery for Emporio Sirenuse (and through her general embodiment of all things chic and Italian), she\u2019s helped us to compile a sort of directory of Murano glassmakers. There\u2019s Giberto Arriavebene, whose utterly divine glasses Sersale deems \u201cvery sophisticated pieces...and best for use in the city.\u201d There\u2019s LagunaB, which was recently taken on by the late founder Marie Brandolini\u2019s son Marcantonio, who Sersale calls \u201can artist himself.\u201d And then there\u2019s Carlo Moretti, who sort of started it all for Sersale. The workshop\u2019s Bora glasses were what first brought Sersale to Murano, and what ignited her interest in the material. \u201cYou know,\u201d she tells me, \u201cit has an attraction\u2014the more you see, the more you\u2019ll get addicted to it.\u201d", "Everything you need to know to shop (or just appreciate) Murano drinking glasses, below.", "Giberto Arrivabene", "Giberto Arrivabene grew up in Venice, surrounded by the Giambattista Tiepolo frescoes that decorated the walls of his family home, the Palazzo Papadopoli.

At the bottom of the palazzo, you\u2019ll find the Aman Venice hotel, where Arrivabene sells the line of glassware that he launched in 2014, when he took his glass connoisseurship to the next level. \u201cThey are made by a man from Murano who blows glass with a thousand-year-old technique and engraves them like it used to be done five hundred years ago,\u201d explains Arrivabene of his process.
