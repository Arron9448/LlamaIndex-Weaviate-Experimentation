Once my dad started a job as manager of an Italian-Cuban caf\u00e9 in the city of Hollywood, just north of Miami, he decided that I needed a work ethic more than I needed a pair of knee-high Demonia boots. And so I became a part-time barista at 14, serving cortados to go through a ventanita\u2014a little window, a Cuban-American invention that predated the Starbucks drive-through. Like most first jobs, it was hardly hip. My uniform was a giant Italian soccer jersey, slung slipshod over my long-sleeved fishnet shirt and ripped jeans. I quickly took to eye rolling at leering comments from older male customers, but one day, two young guys with jet-black hair, face piercings, and tattooed biceps approached the ventanita with a look of recognition in their eyes. \u201cCome to our shop,\u201d they said excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s called Mosh Pitt. We\u2019ll give you a discount if you give us free coffee!\u201d", "I didn\u2019t yet know about Mosh Pitt. I knew, of course, about the famed chain store Hot Topic at Sunset Place: a dimly lit vortex where alt kids acquired band tees and other totems of nonconformity. But that had become the domain of raccoon-eyed cherubs, like a middle school crush of mine, a baby goth who\u2019d rat on shoplifters in exchange for free Slipknot buttons. Though Mosh Pitt was stocked with many of the same wares, it seemed a step up for me: a worldly teen who\u2019d just discovered Sonic Youth and the notion that where you bought something was almost as important as what you bought.", "On an 85-degree day in February, I tossed aside my soccer jersey and marched down Hollywood Boulevard with two cappuccinos in hand. The smell of leather and frankincense wafted from the inside of the shop, where I found the guys from the caf\u00e9 seated on a couch made from rubber tires, listening to Ministry. Hours later, I emerged with a laundry list of records to buy, a set of studded wrist cuffs, and a patent-leather corset-shaped purse that could hold only my tiny purple Nokia phone. But I also left with the sense that I wasn\u2019t just \u201cgoing through a phase.\u201d", "The tropical gothic style I cultivated as a teen would evolve as I got older and lived in New York, Paris, and now Los Angeles. It\u2019s a more versatile look, which incorporates my innate witchiness with my equally innate Caribbean Latina femininity: I pair gold hoops and hair wraps with heavy metal\u2013band tees and black cigarette pants. I also go lighter on the hardware\u2014gold jewelry with protective evil-eye charms and sigils that won\u2019t clash with my tattoos. It\u2019s a far cry from the year-round, brightly hued athleisure looks Miami girls generally sport, but one thing I learned from them is that statement sunglasses are a must.", "My dad didn\u2019t work at the caf\u00e9 forever; and when he got a new job, I never went back to Mosh Pitt, which has since closed down. These days, when visiting family, I like to wander Miami\u2019s art district and peruse the Wynwood Shop, a haven for local indie vendors selling dainty skull stud earrings alongside punk-style pyramid bracelets, as well as Art By God, home to bizarre curios like taxidermy, crystal jewelry, and fossils. I might pick something up from Miami-based clothing brand Deep Antiquity, which specializes in light, summer-friendly goth wear, beach towels, and even votive candles, or get my nails done at Saints-N-Scissors, where the stylists cater to everyone but share an affinity with those for whom every day is Halloween. These stores and salons are generally uncrowded, but they\u2019re not empty either, and when I see a gaggle of sour-faced kids smoking outside Sweat Records, or mysterious women tossing roses into the ocean for Yemaya, I know a gothic energy is in the air\u2014even if it is our little secret.", "Suzy Exposito is a music reporter for the Los Angeles Times."], "authors": ["Suzy Exposito", "Suzy Exposit"], "keywords": ["gothic", "didnt", "pitt", "tees", "scenes", "whod", "dark", "teen", "american", "shop", "work", "caf\u00e9", "mosh", "miami", "day"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
