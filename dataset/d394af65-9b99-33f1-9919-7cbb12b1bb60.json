It is a cause for concern too after a stress fracture in the joint meant he missed the back end of England\u2019s series win in South Africa.

The issue is not related to any previous injury and it is hoped the treatment will allow the condition to settle down quickly, allowing the player to return to action in time for the third Test in Ahmedabad.\u201d", "", "The injury is clearly not considered long-term, with Archer having since been named in the 16-man squad for the five-match Twenty20 international series that begins on 12 March following the Tests.", "It may be that Archer\u2019s injury leads to Jimmy Anderson being retained in the side.
