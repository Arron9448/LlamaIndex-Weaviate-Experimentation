This quandary deeply perplexes the two titular characters who, by the way, are puppets that work at a magical grocery store. They ask chefs from Samin Nosrat to Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. Halfway through, there\u2019s a musical interlude, where they search for the answer\u2014through song.", "Waffles and Mochi is, yes, a program meant for children. However, with scenes like this, it has its adult charms too. (After all, even for those advanced in age, the designation of a tomato is disputed.) Add in cameos from foodie favorites like Nosrat and Andr\u00e9s, who show off their cooking chops by making a tomato basil pasta (Nosrat) and gazpacho (Andr\u00e9s), it is also even an enjoyable binge.", "Waffles and Mochi isn\u2019t the only sustenance-themed show that\u2019s providing solace lately. When Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy began airing on CNN in mid-February, it immediately became beloved for its enthusiastic aura. There was Tucci, zipping around Naples for the best pizza, swooning over rigatoni all'amatriciana in Rome, sipping on aperitivos in Milan. There was no stress, no conflict, no drama\u2014just deliciousness. ( \"Love Stanley Tucci,\u201d Ryan Reynolds tweeted on March 17, speaking for all of us.) The show received such a positive reception that by episode two, CNN had renewed it for a second season.", "Then there\u2019s The Great British Baking Show.
