But even after months of acclimating to the new normal, selecting a face mask that strikes the right balance between breathability and safety is less straightforward than expected. As it turns out, a too-thick mask may be more harmful than helpful.", "Dharushana Muthulingam, M.D., M.S., an infectious disease physician and public health researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, recommends cloth masks that find a happy medium between fabric density and comfortability. \u201cThere is unfortunately an inverse relationship between protection and breathability,\u201d says Muthulingam. \u201cGenerally, you don\u2019t want to see light between the fibers when you hold them up to the sun, but the mask should also be breathable, especially in warm months.\u201d While studies have shown that tightly woven cotton fabrics\u2014like quilter\u2019s cotton and even tea towels\u2014are the best, they aren\u2019t always the most comfortable fabrics when you add humidity, heat, or an additional mask into the mix. \u201cIf the mask is uncomfortable, research has shown people just touch their face even more,\u201d Muthulingam continues. She recommends lighter cottons, polyesters, or performance fabrics as they are acceptable and safe to use even when worn over a surgical, 3-ply mask.", "The shape of the mask is also an important consideration. Cloth masks that mimic surgical masks with comfortable ear straps and a secure fit are preferred. \u201cThe key is to eliminate gaps between your skin and the mask, however that is achieved,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has to cover your nose and go below your chin.\u201d", "With more and more options populating the market, there are plenty of breathable masks to consider.
