The vast majority of patients were also given a previously-authorized and widely-used cheap steroid called dexamethasone, which has already demonstrated improved survival for critically ill patients in need of oxygen.", "U.K. officials hope that encouraging National Health Service providers to use tocilizumab, beginning Friday, will bring relief to burdened health systems amid a surge in cases linked to a mutated strain.

While hospital mortality was 36% among the control group, deaths dropped by 8% among patients receiving tocilizumab. The drug has seen mixed results, however, with the Italian Medicines Agency previously finding no benefit in terms of entry into intensive care or in terms of survival.", "Meanwhile, last fall, the drug sponsor and Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche said people who received tocilizumab, marketed as Actemra/RoActemra, were 44% less likely to progress to the point where they would need to rely on life-support equipment, according to the company's Phase 3 EMPACTA study.", "Study lead Prof. Anthony Gordon of Imperial College London also lauded the results.", "\"This is a significant finding which could have immediate implications for the sickest patients with COVID-19,\" he said in a university release.", "These drugs are known as immunomodulators, and California pulmonary disease specialist Dr. Imran Sharief previously detailed to Fox News how the drugs work in coronavirus patients.", "GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "Coronavirus invades the body through receptors in the nasal passages and airways, Sharief had explained.
