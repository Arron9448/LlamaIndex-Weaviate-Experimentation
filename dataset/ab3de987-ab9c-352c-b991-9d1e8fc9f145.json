Collyer found that Horowitz\u2019s report, issued last week, revealed that the FBI misled the National Security Division of the Justice Department and \u201cequally misled the FISC\u201d to obtain a court order authorizing the surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.", "This is the type of government misconduct that endangers the rights of us all to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures \u2013 a right guaranteed the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.", "DEVIN NUNES: FISA COURT'S BEHAVIOR 'TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE,' CONGRESS MUST FIX IT", "The ruling is a big deal for the FBI and for at least one FBI lawyer (not named in Judge Collyer\u2019s order), because it practically invites disbarment for any lawyer or lawyers involved in improperly obtaining the FISC warrants authorizing FBI surveillance of Page.", "The most important rule all lawyers must follow is: Don\u2019t lie to the judge or let your client lie to the judge. If lawyers and their clients can freely lie to judges without punishment, they poison our judicial system and can improperly alter the result of court decisions. And when government lawyers lie to a judge, they pave the way for government abuses.", "Collyer\u2019s order says the FISC is very concerned with four applications to surveil Page. In a rare public order, the judge referenced the inspector general\u2019s report of an FBI lawyer who \u201cengaged in conduct\u2026 intended to mislead the FBI agent who ultimately swore to the facts in the application.\u201d", "The judge further writes that the conduct of the FBI lawyer \u2013 an employee of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of General Counsel \u2013 \u201cgave rise to serious concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the FISC in any matter in which the OCG attorney was involved.\u201d", "Despite the tough language by Judge Collyer, the FISC still falls short of taking its own disciplinary action against the FBI lawyer. This is contemptible behavior.", "Instead, the judge in effect told the FBI to get back to the FISC in January to let the court know how it plans to not lie and mislead the court in the future. That's just too weak a response to FBI misconduct. This is why it is up to whatever state or states license the lawyer or lawyers who lied to the FISC to start professional disciplinary proceedings immediately that could lead to disbarment.", "Lawyers always owe a duty of candor to any court. Candor can be defined as the quality of being honest, open and sincere. Anyone who causes an FBI agent to lie in court does not fit this definition.", "As Collyer\u2019s order points out, \u201ccandor is fundamental\u201d to the proper operation of courts. The duty of candor is even greater in \u201cex parte\u201d proceedings \u2013 proceedings where there is not an opposing party. All proceedings before the FISC are ex parte.", "It does not matter that the FBI lawyer was not the person who made the presentation to the court. If the FBI lawyer caused an FBI agent to make a misrepresentation to the court then disbarment of the attorney \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 appropriate.", "The American Bar Association Rules of Professional Conduct set out this duty of candor in Rule 3.3. The short version of this rule is: Don\u2019t lie to a court or mislead a court; don\u2019t fail to disclose adverse information to a court; don\u2019t let your client lie \u2013 even if that client is the FBI; and in an ex parte proceeding like a FISA application, tell the court all the information you have \u2013 even if it\u2019s adverse to your position \u2013 so the court can make an informed decision.", "A lawyer\u2019s duty of candor is and should be held sacred by the legal profession. If lawyers are not truthful to judges \u2013 even when it hurts their case \u2013 the legal profession suffers, the legal system as a whole suffers, and any court affected by such misconduct loses credibility and risks doing a massive injustice to individuals.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "The FISC, in particular, may be on thin ice with lawmakers and is facing increased scrutiny, given the potential for abuse and the misconduct identified in this ongoing fiasco. This doesn\u2019t bode well for the FISC\u2019s continued existence \u2013 at least not in the current form.", "Fired FBI Director James Comey said to Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s incredibly hard to get a FISA,\u201d referring to an order from the FISC under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That is simply not true.", "As Fox News has reported, government surveillance requests are approved more than 99 percent of the time. Only a single request was rejected in 2018 out of 1,081 total requests.", "The FISC is arguably a rubber stamp for the FBI already \u2013 so it\u2019s hard to imagine why any lawyer would want or need to be less than candid in the first place.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "So the bottom line is this: any lawyer who intentionally misleads the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is not fit to remain a member of the legal profession.
