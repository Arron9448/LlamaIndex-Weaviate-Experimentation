Help, please!", "Ellen, Darlington, County Durham", "\u201cAll the TV chefs tell us to stay calm,\u201d says Heath Ball, landlord of award-winning pub The Red Lion & Sun in Highgate, north London, \u201cbut the reality is, Ellen will be feeling like an England rugby fullback with the entire South Africa pack bearing down on her, so a bit of panic is kind of inevitable.\u201d", "Not that that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing, Ball adds, because it keeps you on your toes. Even though this is, in essence, only a glorified roast dinner, it\u2019s by far the most important one of the year. \u201cSo take it easy on Christmas Eve, and don\u2019t dive into the champagne too early on Christmas morning. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that once the food\u2019s on the table. In fact, once your job is done, I\u2019d rather hope people will start to bring the drinks to you.\u201d", "Get organised, too, says James Rix, chef/owner of The Fox & Hounds in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, a perennial runner-up in Observer Food Monthly\u2019s best Sunday lunch award. \u201cFirst things first, make a to-do list, starting with the time you want to serve and working back from there. There\u2019s a reason many chefs write lists: it gives you control. I still do one for the next day every night after service, and then rewrite it the next morning.\u201d", "And don\u2019t overcomplicate things, adds Rix, who in a former life was head chef at Alastair Little in Soho. \u201cDon\u2019t be daft and try to make 20 vegetable sides. Stick to the traditional basics \u2013 roast potatoes, roast carrots and parsnips, sprouts, cabbage. No one will judge you for it.\u201d Both Rix and Ball say you\u2019d be surprised quite how much you can get done the day before: parboil the spuds for roasting, prep the root veg, blanch and refresh any green veg \u2013 all you have to do to those on the day is dunk them in boiling water at the last minute, to heat through, though being a la-di-da chef type, Rix sautees his greens in excessive amounts of butter afterwards.", "Rix\u2019s main tip, though, is: \u201cDon\u2019t buy a whole turkey; it\u2019ll take up the whole oven, and even experienced cooks find it hard to get the breast and legs to cook evenly.\u201d Instead, get a crown or a boned and rolled breast and, if brown meat\u2019s your thing, a stuffed leg or two, too. \u201cYou\u2019ll save yourself a world of pain, and it takes an hour and a half to cook, rather than four or more.\u201d The joint will then happily rest for an hour, giving you plenty of time to finish the veg and gravy. (Speaking of gravy, Rix says there\u2019s no sin in buying it in, provided it\u2019s decent quality \u2013 \u201cMarks & Sparks do a particularly good chicken one,\u201d he says, \u201cthough there are other brands out there. Deglaze the roasting tin with white wine, as usual, stir in the gravy and you\u2019re in business.\u201d)", "Stosie Madi, who rules the roasts at The Parker\u2019s Arms in Newton-in-Bowland, near Clitheroe, Lancashire, meanwhile, says novice roast dinner cook Ellen should abandon the troublesome turkey entirely and make something a lot more manageable instead. \u201cSlow-roast beef is very forgiving,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the oven does all the work for you.\u201d Opt for a topside or brisket joint with a good layer of fat tied on. \u201cAny butcher will sort that for you; if they\u2019re any cop, they\u2019ll also give you advice on how to cook it.\u201d", "The trick, Madi says, is in the marinade and the browning. Get those right, and you\u2019ll be in for a relatively stress-free day, secure in the knowledge that there\u2019s nothing going awry inside that oven. \u201cLeave the joint overnight in a dry marinade of flavours you like: garlic, thyme, parsley, bay, peppercorns are especially good with beef. And don\u2019t add any salt until you\u2019re about to roast it.\u201d In the morning, brown it all over in butter and oil (the oil stops the butter burning). \u201cDon\u2019t be shy: this is where a lot of the flavour comes from.\u201d", "Pop it in a thick-based pot, ring with your veg of choice \u2013 shallots or red onions, carrots and a little celery are classic good companions \u2013 add stock and/or red wine or stout to cover by half, and cook in the middle of a 160C (140C fan)/ gas 2\u00bd oven for three to four hours, until it\u2019s fork tender, then move to the top of the oven, where it\u2019s hotter, to crisp up the fat. \u201cSo long as there\u2019s always enough stock to keep the beef moist, you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d The bonus, of course, is that this guarantees you bucketloads of that all-important gravy, too.", "\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
