There was also a continuous \u201cBrrrrrrrrrrrrr,\u201d she says, like a deep engine humming \u2013 the sound of tonnes of water falling, falling, falling from a great height. \u201cIt almost vibrates inside your body.\u201d", "The Brazilian big-wave surfer is reflecting on the events of 11 February 2020, when she rode a monstrous 22.4m (73.5ft) wave at Nazar\u00e9 in Portugal. It set the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed by a woman. It was also the biggest wave surfed by anyone, male or female \u2013 the first time this feat has been achieved by a woman.", "Watching footage of the ride, part of the Nazar\u00e9 Tow Surfing Challenge, induces goosebumps and gritted teeth: the 5ft 5in surfer, a crouching speck, slices through a wall of water the height of a seven-storey building; white horses gallop at her heels as the wave crashes violently behind her. The triumph of a female athlete in any open competition \u2013 something occasionally seen in ultra-marathon running or endurance swimming \u2013 is significant. That it happened in big-wave surfing, one of the most macho, testosterone-fuelled sports on the planet, is stunning.", "Even so, the surf industry\u2019s reaction to the ride was more ripple than tsunami. \u201cOh, there was no aftermath,\u201d Gabeira says, laughing wryly. The 33-year-old is speaking from her home in Nazar\u00e9, a fishing village north of Lisbon. She has a broad smile and a raspy, sun-baked voice; a rack of surfboards sits behind her. Difficulties with judging the wave\u2019s height (a common issue in the sport, given the inexact science involved) and a comparable-sized ride that same day by Frenchwoman Justine Dupont, meant Gabeira\u2019s record was only confirmed months later, on 10 September. That\u2019s when the headlines rolled in \u2013 to an extent. Mainstream international press seemed far more interested than surf media, a tight bundle of publications that tend to heavily favour men\u2019s coverage.", "Riding high: Maya Gabeira surfing in Nazar\u00e9, Portugal, where last season she rode the biggest wave of any surfer \u2013 male or female. Photograph: Armando Franca/AP", "Yet its significance shouldn\u2019t be downplayed. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge accomplishment for Maya and great for the sport,\u201d says Keala Kennelly, a 42-year-old matriarch of big-wave surfing and a trailblazer for female riders. \u201cWhether it was super talked about or not in the surfing community, it\u2019s still going to move the needle forward.\u201d", "It represents the latest achievement for the small, steely pack of female athletes battling to claim their place in the line-ups at the world\u2019s most tempestuous surf breaks. For years they have been navigating a sea of unequal pay, limited opportunities and media objectification, fighting for the chance to make a career out of doing what they love. Progress has been made. Much is still to be done. They won\u2019t be denied.", "Gabeira, who learned to surf growing up in Rio de Janeiro, is among the world\u2019s best female big-wave riders, along with Dupont, the Hawaiians Kennelly and Paige Alms, San Franciscan Bianca Valenti, and fellow Brazilian Andrea Moller. They are heavily outnumbered by men: there are close to 100 male professionals.", "Big-wave surfing is a separate discipline from regular surfing, which attracts more eyeballs, will soon join the Olympics and is headlined by household names like Stephanie Gilmore and Kelly Slater. Big-wave is the unruly cousin \u2013 less commercial, more extreme.", "To be a big-wave surfer is to spend most of your time training and most of the rest of your time scanning weather forecasts and tracking down heavy swell. The best breaks are legendary: Teahupo\u2019o (\u201cCho-poo\u201d or \u201cChopes\u201d) in Tahiti; \u201cJaws\u201d off Maui, Hawaii; Mavericks in northern California; Praia do Norte in Nazar\u00e9. In Nazar\u00e9, which has the most consistent big surf, there might be 10 days a season \u2013 winter \u2013 where waves are \u201cbig\u201d (over 6.1m, 20ft), and just two where they are \u201cgiant\u201d (over 15.2m, 50ft). In Hawaii, giant might only happen once a year, if at all. It takes an enormous amount of effort to be in the right place for that special wave. And icy nerves to capitalise when it finally arrives.", "Lauren Hill, a surf journalist and the author of She Surf: The Rise of Female Surfing, likens big-wave surfers to endurance runners. \u201cPeople who do ultra-endurance are like runners\u2019 runners; similarly, regular surfers have this incredible admiration for big-wave surfers and all that goes into getting that one ride,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be prepared for the ultimate sacrifice every time you paddle out.\u201d", "The women speak with a cult-like reverence for their sport. Kennelly, who lives in Oahu, Hawaii, says it \u201cattracts a really passionate person that does it for the love of the sport, not to get rich\u201d. She describes as addictive the \u201cforced presence\u201d that is required. \u201cYou have to be 100% in the moment otherwise you could get injured or killed.\u201d She says she feels fear \u201cevery time I paddle out, because I understand the consequences \u2013 but when you\u2019re able to conquer it, that is one of the most empowering feelings.\u201d And Gabeira describes the \u201clife lessons\u201d that the ocean imparts. \u201cI joke that big-wave surfing was my university: I got taught by the ocean, in hard ways.\u201d", "Peak practice: Maya Gabeira in the Nazare Tow Surfing Challenge in Portugal. Photograph: Armando Franca/AP", "One of those lessons almost cost Gabeira her life. In 2013 she nearly drowned after a wipe-out at Nazar\u00e9. Carlos Burle, her tow partner, found her floating face-down. \u201cIt was a moment of sadness and of realising I had lost control of the situation \u2013 and that it was up to fate at that point,\u201d she says. \u201cRealising you might die is a very difficult process to go through and there\u2019s definitely a scar that\u2019s left on you, I think forever.\u201d", "Unsurprisingly, big-wave injuries are common \u2013 athletes suffer torn ligaments and blown-out joints from being rag-dolled under water after wiping out \u2013 and can be extreme: Kennelly once tore open her face on Teahupo\u2019o\u2019s shallow reef and required plastic surgery. Almost every season, like her compatriots, she suffers torn ligaments (hamstrings, back) and blown-out joints (knees, hips) from the force of being rag-dolled under water after a wipe-out.", "To ensure they\u2019re in top shape, athletes do daily workouts in the gym or practise holding their breath in the pool for short bursts \u201cmany, many, many times\u201d, Gabeira says. \u201cIn the ocean I\u2019m rarely going to be calm and get a full breath in, so the five-minute hold doesn\u2019t really matter, but it matters that I\u2019m capable of doing 30-40 seconds while I\u2019m completely exhausted.\u201d", "In part, owing to its extreme physicality, big-wave surfing is far more male-dominated than regular surfing. Most of the time, out in the lineup, it\u2019s an open playing field. This takes its toll. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting shoulder to shoulder with these guys,\u201d says Kennelly, \u201cand they\u2019re physically stronger than you, can paddle faster, and are much more aggressive.\u201d For surfers, like Gabeira, who have a partner tow them in behind a jetski, \u201cit\u2019s very challenging being a woman because I surf with a very good male athlete. I have to be on top of my game and mentally sharp in a sport that counts force and testosterone and power.\u201d", "You have to prepare for the ultimate sacrifice each time you paddle out", "More problematically, the fact it is a boys\u2019 club has meant that a red-blooded culture has long prevailed. In 1963, leading surfer Buzzy Trent wrote in an article: \u201cGirls do fine when it comes to housework\u2026 and even riding the ankle snappers at Malibu. But one thing I can\u2019t stand is girls riding (or attempting to ride) big waves.\u201d He continued: \u201cGirls are intended to be feminine, and big-wave riding is definitely masculine.\u201d", "Half a century on, female athletes can cite countless examples of sexism in the line-up. \u201cAt Mavericks I would feel like I was the only feline in a pack of hungry lions. These guys want to chat me up,\u201d says Valenti. She worked on her mindset with sports psychologists. \u201cI had to figure out how to stay focused and be like, \u2018I\u2019m not here to talk, I\u2019m here to surf.\u2019\u201d", "In the aftermath of Gabeira\u2019s near-drowning, Hill says Gabeira was treated unfairly, the target of lots of \u201cquite sexist\u201d commentary. Most notably, renowned American surfer Laird Hamiltonhumiliated the Brazilian when he said in a TV interview: \u201cMaya doesn\u2019t have the skill to be in these conditions; she should not be in this kind of surf. And I feel like it\u2019s Carlos [Burle\u2019s] responsibility to take care of her.\u201d", "However, the culture has improved significantly in the past couple of years. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s welcoming now, but it\u2019s a possible place to strive as a woman. That\u2019s a progression. There\u2019s representation,\u201d says Gabeira.", "These improvements chime with broader societal movements such as #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, yet they owe more to the simple fact of these female surfers turning up, time and again, \u201ccharging\u201d the biggest waves, and proving they can mix it with the guys.", "\u2018Surfer girls once had to sell bikinis. I\u2019ve never surfed in a bikini in my life \u2013 I have five layers on\u2019: Maya Gabeira. Photograph: Shanti Tan/TAG Heuer", "A watershed moment came in 2016 when Kennelly\u2019s Teahupo\u2019o ride won best barrel at the XXL awards \u2013 \u201cthe Oscars of big-wave surfing\u201d \u2013 becoming the first female win in an open competition. Gabeira\u2019s new record will propel that momentum forwards.", "The single biggest moment for gender equality in surfing \u2013 including big-wave surfing \u2013 came in 2018. The World Surf League (WSL), surfing\u2019s governing body, announced it would award equal pay to women and men for all professional competitions. Big-wave surfers had a major hand in this: for two years, the Committee for Equity in Women\u2019s Surfing (CEWS), comprising close friends Valenti, Kennelly, Alms and Moller, had campaigned tirelessly. It was a bruising process but Kennelly calls the result \u201cmonumental.\u201d", "This means that male and female big-wave surfers \u2013 like all other pro surfers \u2013 can win equal prize money and, in theory, earn comparable livings. In reality, though, the particulars of big-wave surfing mean there are still enormous gender pay gaps. Unlike the Tour, which has dozens of events, there are fewer major big-wave competitions.", "Consequently, the vast majority of big-wave athletes\u2019 earnings \u2013 male or female \u2013 comes from corporate sponsorship. The biggest threat to a career is not being flattened by a 22m wall of water but the more prosaic matter of a lack of funds. Hunting big waves is an expensive pursuit and backing from one of the core surf brands \u2013 Quicksilver, Ripcurl, Billabong, Volcom or Roxy \u2013 is tough to come by. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find sponsors that see the value in big-wave surfing,\u201d says Alms. \u201cIt is so sporadic that a lot of companies have a hard time justifying the amount of work that goes into what we do.\u201d", "This is especially true for female surfers. Kennelly estimates male big-wave athletes earn 80-90% more from sponsorship than their female counterparts.", "And when they do back female surfers, brands have long favoured a bikini-clad feminine ideal. \u201cFor a long time surfer girls would have to sell bikinis; I\u2019ve never surfed in a bikini in my whole life; that would not work for me. I\u2019m surfing huge waves. I have five layers on,\u201d says Gabeira.", "Kennelly, one of the first openly gay women in pro surfing and was dropped by most of her sponsors when she came out in 2008 (at the time she was on the Tour, not doing big-wave riding), is more scathing. Two years ago she said in an interview that brands thought it was \u201cfun seeing women in a bikini, but not fun seeing you charge giant waves\u201d. I ask if she feels differently now. She doesn\u2019t. \u201cThat attitude hasn\u2019t changed at all. You\u2019re expected to look like a model and then somehow surf like an athlete.\u201d", "At present, only three women \u2013 Gabeira, Alms and Dupont \u2013 have enough backing to ride full-time, compared to dozens of men (although there\u2019s also a much bigger pool of male surfers). The rest have other gigs. Valenti runs a restaurant, Kennelly is a DJ and bartender. \u201cWhen I won my big-wave world title [in 2019], I went right back to Oahu for my bartending job.\u201d", "These surfers see hurdles ahead but also huge opportunities for improvement. They want access to more funding, better equipment, and male-only competitions. They want to see more women working at surf companies and publications, which, like the Mavericks line-up, are overwhelmingly male.", "CEWS was dissolved this year \u2013 \u201cwe completed what we set out to do,\u201d says Valenti \u2013 and the \u201cnext big wave\u201d involves partnering with top female athletes from other sports, such as footballer (Kennelly DJs on the side; Valenti runs a restaurant). Valenti wonders how much big brands are missing out on by not investing equally in female surfers and is enthused about the potential for growth. \u201cHypothetically, because men have had the resources for so long, their level of performance won\u2019t have as big a jump. I think for women we\u2019re going to see one crazy increase once we get the resources we need. I\u2019m excited for that, as an athlete and fan.\u201d", "There are heartening signs elsewhere. Social media has enabled female surfers to have a voice, and there\u2019s a growing network of independent female-run surf brands and niche publications telling fresh stories. Today\u2019s teenagers have women athletes showing what\u2019s possible.", "When asked if she sees herself as a role model, Gabeira demurs. She seems uncomfortable with the spotlight. But the reality is that her record-breaking wave will give youngsters something to strive towards. She says she\u2019s currently writing a children\u2019s book and wants to \u201cshare my story and encourage girls and boys and make sure they stay motivated. I would love to be a source of courage and perseverance for kids.\u201d It sounds like she might be a role model after all. What\u2019s the book about?
