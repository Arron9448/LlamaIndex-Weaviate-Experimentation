But he had a lot of trouble with it.", "annie brown", "And when he did settle into a job, it paid a little more than half of what he\u2019d been making in the oil fields. So Joanna was hoping that she\u2019d be able to manage a job at Best Buy better with school than she had at the smoothie place. But it wasn\u2019t that her grades had improved.", "joanna lopez Well, my grades aren\u2019t looking good right now. My mom got in the mail today. And I got in trouble. But \u2014 annie brown What do you mean she got in the mail today? What did she get? joanna lopez One of my teachers sent out my grades. So he kind of told on me. But that\u2019s OK. [LAUGHS]", "annie brown", "Joanna told us that her plan had originally been to go to a four-year college and study psychology. The plan was always a bit of a dream. She wasn\u2019t great at school. And money had been tight before. But those things had never been more true than they were this year. And now, she was finding it difficult to even imagine.", "joanna lopez I feel like I haven\u2019t learned anything in school. And I feel like it would be hard for me to go into something that I don\u2019t really have an idea what\u2019s going on. And so I kind of just want to have an easy path and study cosmetology. That\u2019s always been my plan B. So I feel like that\u2019s kind of turning into my plan A.", "annie brown", "Over the last few months, we\u2019ve checked in with Joanna\u2019s guidance counselor and the college counselor responsible for seniors. And they both agreed that social isolation, financial stress and a lack of motivation have left many seniors struggling to hang on and uncertain about their futures. The college counselor estimated that only about half as many students have applied to college this year as in previous years.", "joanna lopez Well, I guess I kind of started looking at the reality of how hard it is to get into good colleges and how expensive it is. That\u2019s another thing. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for my college all by myself. And I would need help from my parents. And I don\u2019t want to ask that from them because they\u2019re already struggling enough. annie brown Last year, do you think that you would have thought maybe they could help me? joanna lopez Yes, I did think that. [LAUGHS]", "annie brown", "It was always asking a lot of marching band to make up for so many of the stresses of this year, especially a marching season whose ambitions had been shrunk down to just four games and now, three. And then, just four days after that first game was canceled, Jimmy gave us some more news. Something had just happened at an early morning practice.", "annie brown Hey, we\u2019re all here. jimmy olague Good morning, ladies. annie brown Tell us what happened. jimmy olague Well, we were adding some different choreography to the show just to spice it up and so forth. And we\u2019re rehearsing right now. In fact, I\u2019m sitting in the truck looking at them go through different sets with music and so forth. And so yeah, I mean we were in the middle of rehearsal. I don\u2019t know if I can hear the band playing in front of me. annie brown No, we can\u2019t hear. jimmy olague OK. annie brown Can you hold up your phone? jimmy olague Yeah, I will roll down the window a little bit.", "annie brown", "They had been in the middle of working on something when a school police car drove into their parking lot practice field.", "jimmy olague So when I turn around, I see that it\u2019s the ECISD police. And she quickly grabs my attention and waves me to her car. So I said, yes ma\u2019am. And she says, the nurse is trying to get ahold of you guys. Y\u2019all need to call the nurse. I\u2019m like, OK, so quickly, mentally, you\u2019re like, all right. I think I know what this is about. And then you\u2019re like, damn it.", "annie brown", "And what he feared was correct.", "jimmy olague We had a student who tested positive for Covid in the band and was in rehearsal last week.", "annie brown", "At this point, there had been a couple of dozen positive cases among the students and staff at the school. But as far as Jimmy knew, this was the first positive test on the band, a band of 160 kids.", "jimmy olague And then she asked me questions. Do you think this person has been in close quarters or close in spacing? And I said, no. Our drill writer wrote six feet or more for each kid so every time we move, they\u2019re keeping a safe distance. annie brown Do the kids know anything about what just happened? jimmy olague No, they don\u2019t know anything. annie brown And so what happens next? jimmy olague Now, we release them. If they are going to school on campus today, then they go to the main building, to the band hall, put up their stuff, and get ready for their second period class. And if they\u2019re going home, then they wait for their parents or whoever\u2019s picking them up to take them home. Some of these kids drive on their own. Now, you\u2019re just crossing your fingers hoping that it\u2019s just this one person and not a group in the band. annie brown So you don\u2019t know who exactly this band member who has tested positive has been in contact with, but \u2014 jimmy olague No. annie brown \u2014 still kids are going to class? I\u2019m just wondering with that in mind, why not just tell the whole band, do remote school for the next two weeks? jimmy olague For the next two weeks? Yeah, well, I mean, that\u2019s the thing. If they do remote school, then they wouldn\u2019t be able to come to rehearsal as well. So I understand your question. annie brown Yeah. jimmy olague But the nurse has or will contact these kids being exposed. They\u2019ll go ahead and them home or whatever and do what they need to be doing. annie brown Right. Thank you, Jimmy. Good luck. jimmy olague You\u2019re very welcome. Thank you. All right, ladies. Y\u2019all have a great day. annie brown All right. jimmy olague OK. annie brown Bye-bye. jimmy olague All right. annie brown Bye.", "annie brown", "We reached out to the nurses who said that they had followed their protocol, the protocol that they had been trained on. What we didn\u2019t know when we talked to Jimmy was that that training consisted of a three-hour online course on contact tracing, and that there were just two nurses responsible for contact tracing for around 4,000 students and 300 staff at Odessa High School. But following that protocol, in this case, the nurses determined that no one else on the band had been exposed. Practices could continue. And the future games were still on.", "speaker Welcome, Bronchos! [CHEERING]", "annie brown", "Which is how, finally, three weeks later, on a crisp October Friday, the Odessa High Bronchos marching band had their first game day.", "speaker [INAUDIBLE] of the year. Let\u2019s go! [CHEERING] Now, let\u2019s hear from our Broncho band. Here we go. [CHEERING]", "annie brown", "In the morning, there was a pep rally where the band played the fight song to a mostly empty audience. The guests of honor, the football team, sat on the field in chairs spaced six feet apart \u2014", "speaker (SINGING) Oh say, can you see \u2014", "annie brown", "\u2014 while someone sang the national anthem. The showgirls danced their routine, and the football coach gave some final notes of pleading encouragement.", "speaker Good morning. We just ask that you show up tonight, you be loud, dress warm. Let\u2019s go kick some bulldog butt. [CHEERING]", "annie brown", "And with that, the pep rally was over, and the students went about their normal Covid school day. As the afternoon rolled around, band members signed out of their Google Classrooms, put on their uniforms, and piled into buses to drive to Ratliff Stadium for the game. This was the same stadium Friday Night Lights was filmed in, where that night, the Odessa High Bronchos would play the Midland Bulldogs. The game had started by the time the band arrived. And they made their way into the stadium and took their spot in the stands at the 20-yard line. They set themselves up to play songs to cheer on the football team as they played. Everyone was excited when Odessa High made the first touchdown of the night \u2014", "announcer Bronchos 6, Bulldogs 0.", "annie brown", "A 20-yard run into the end zone by the quarterback.", "announcer [INAUDIBLE] end zone for the Bulldogs touchdown.", "annie brown", "But the Bulldogs caught up quickly. And by the end of the first half \u2014", "speaker Well, we\u2019re losing. [LAUGHS]", "annie brown", "It wasn\u2019t looking good.", "announcer Bulldogs, 14. Bronchos, six.", "annie brown", "And then it was time for what the band had been preparing for \u2014 their very first marching performance at halftime.", "speaker Pass the gummy worms, bro.", "annie brown", "But first, as tradition called for \u2014", "speaker Don\u2019t bite it. Don\u2019t chew it. Just [INAUDIBLE]. Keep it in your mouth the entire game.", "annie brown", "They each got a gummy worm to hold in their mouth \u2014", "speaker There\u2019s really no purpose, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s fun. [LAUGHS]", "annie brown", "\u2014 then took to the field.", "announcer Ladies and gentlemen. the Ector County Independent School District and Odessa High School are proud to present the award-winning Odessa High School Broncho Marching Band.", "annie brown", "Jimmy is on the 45-yard line, facing the band, watching as they get into position.", "jimmy olague They start moving their first movement. And we were like, OK, everybody remember to move. Nobody stood still, so thank God. So far so good. The drum line starts sounding good. OK, they\u2019re together. And the band\u2019s sounding really good. They\u2019re playing nice and loud. And then the soloists start coming up and start playing. And they\u2019re getting a good crowd response after each soloist. So I\u2019m like, OK. They\u2019re doing it. They\u2019re doing what we\u2019ve been working on. Seeing the drum line move to their formations and then line up in the middle of the field. And I\u2019m like, OK, they\u2019re about to move up forward, which means here comes the drum break. So that\u2019s when I get excited because that\u2019s my baby right there. So the snare drums do their little thing and play. And then the bass drums do their thing and play. And while that\u2019s happening, the cymbals are back there doing twirls and visuals and so forth. When you\u2019re down there in front of it, right there in the middle, and it\u2019s just hitting your face, you\u2019re like, oh this is \u2014 life is good right now on Friday night in Odessa, Texas. was a lot of good things, man. I\u2019m proud of you. Good job. It\u2019s great to play for people [INAUDIBLE]", "annie brown", "As they left the field and headed back to their seats, Jimmy was there to meet them.", "jimmy olague And they did great, did great. For the first one, it\u2019s really neat. They had a great response, man. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been waiting for, for them. So they feel good.", "annie brown", "From there, the rest of the game went as they often do.", "announcer And stop. They just scored.
