Photographed by Annie Leibovitz, Vogue, January 2021", "VISUAL EXCESS IS NOTHING new to the Spanish pop star Rosali\u0301a, whose videos and performances are so saturated with flaring colors and baroque imagery that they could have floated off the pages of art-history books. Yet in mid-October, as I follow her into a massive, three-floor costume emporium called Abracadabra in New York City\u2019s Flatiron District, she\u2019s momentarily overwhelmed, like a character in a kitschy, haunted Wonderland. Nearby, a gaggle of animatronic clowns smile maniacally while holding chain saws; lush feather boas cascade down shelves like ivy; and the aisles twinkle with constellations of accessories covered in rhinestones and glitter. Rosali\u0301a wanders deeper into the shop, collecting its camp and horror like a human satellite.", "She\u2019s wearing white Prada sneakers and Burberry trousers and, beneath a pink-lined Burberry trench coat, a present for her 28th birthday from her older sister, Pili: an oversized T-shirt printed with a bubble-gum-colored Lexus. A white KN95 mask lets her glide discreetly past customers too distracted by papier-ma\u0302che\u0301 ghosts and cackling goblins to notice she\u2019s the Grammy winner who, in the last few weeks alone, launched a lipstick collaboration with MAC, performed at Rihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty show, and appeared in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s internet-shattering \u201cWAP\u201d video. The one giveaway is her voice. A motion-activated monster roars in her direction, and she warbles, \u201cOooh!\u201d sounding exactly as though she\u2019s ad-libbing on a record.", "Going to Abracadabra was her idea, a recommendation from a stylist friend. We\u2019d met in the lobby of the Mercer Hotel, where Rosali\u0301a has been staying this fall weekend. She\u2019d greeted me coming out of the elevator with her assistant, Nicole, and we laughed while fumbling through a COVID-appropriate greeting (we ended up shaking hands). On the drive to Abracadabra, Rosali\u0301a chattily told me how she woke up with a craving for Italian food, about her 6 a.m. jog along Prince Street, and how she\u2019d considered a Sailor Moon or Pretty Woman Halloween costume\u2014but had her heart set on Leeloo, Milla Jovovich\u2019s flame-haired character from Luc Besson\u2019s 1997 cult classic, The Fifth Element. Such a transformation shouldn\u2019t be hard for a global shape-shifter known for slinking across the barriers of genre and form. I ask her, as we walk past rows of medieval gowns and sparkly flapper dresses, how she decides on her looks, which seem to morph with each video she releases\u2014from the fur-clad glamazon in \u201cAute Cuture\u201d to the entranced dancer with a Frida Kahlo unibrow in \u201cA Pale\u0301.\u201d Rosali\u0301a speaks softly in Spanish, punctuating most of her sentences with an affable laugh, but here her voice takes on a sudden seriousness: \u201cI think about what I\u2019m communicating, what\u2019s underneath,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the treatment? What ideas are there? Am I going to be dancing or performing?\u201d She deeply trusts her impulses. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of instinctive,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how things make you feel when you see them. What colors grab your attention, how a texture makes you feel when you touch it. I love things that are really structured or really loose\u2014I\u2019m not really about finding a middle ground. I like extremes.\u201d"], "authors": ["Julyssa Lopez", "Julyssa Lope", "Annie Leibovit", "Carlos Nazari"], "keywords": ["writing", "album", "really", "white", "whats", "extremes", "rosalia", "embracing", "ambition", "abracadabra", "video", "things", "burberry", "rosal\u00eda", "shes", "voice"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
