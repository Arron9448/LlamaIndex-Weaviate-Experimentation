This is creating new competition for the online giant even as Amazon itself continues to upend traditional retail and distribution strategies.", "Some of the new offerings cater to brands that may sell on Amazon but don\u2019t want to pay the company\u2019s fulfillment charges, or that view Amazon as a potential competitor.
