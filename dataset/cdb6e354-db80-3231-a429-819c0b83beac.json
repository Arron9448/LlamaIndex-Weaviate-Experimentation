Unfortunately, everyone on the island is also out to kill him.", "For this month\u2019s cover story, we take a deep dive into the creation of Deathloop. We spent several hours with the designers and artists working on the game and walked away with a better understanding of Deathloop\u2019s gameplay hooks. Across 14 pages, we break down our exclusive demo in detail, highlight many of Colt\u2019s phenomenal powers, and explain some of the many approaches that players can take through Deathloop\u2019s open-ended environments.", "But Deathloop isn\u2019t the only reason to dive into this issue.
