{"paragraphs": ["With books, comics, and video games, there\u2019s been no shortage of ways to experience The Witcher. Creator Andrzej Sapkowski built a rich fantasy world with complex characters, earning him several awards and the moniker \u201cThe Polish Tolkien.\u201d If you\u2019re reading this magazine, you probably know Geralt of Rivia from CD Projekt Red\u2019s video game trilogy. Now Netflix is creating its own adaptation starring Henry Cavill. With the first eight-episode season launching this week, we chatted with showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich about what to expect.", "", "Geralt\u2019s Introduction To The Small Screen", "Starting early in Geralt\u2019s adventures, the first season draws inspiration from short story collections The Last Wish (Hissrich\u2019s favorite) and Sword of Destiny. \u201cI really do feel like they set up the foundation of the world,\u201d Hissrich says. \u201cThey set up the politics, geography, varying social groups, and the basic tone of The Continent is incredibly well laid out.\u201d The opening episode is based on the short story \u201cThe Lesser Evil,\u201d where Geralt meets a character named Renfri and makes a difficult decision that haunts him for the next seven episodes. \u201cI needed to make sure that the story would change him \u2013 that whatever happened to him in that episode would change his trajectory throughout the season,\u201d Hissrich explains. The whole event causes Geralt to examine his witcher ways, which is all he\u2019s ever known. \u201cI want him to start questioning why he\u2019s doing it, and if there\u2019s something else out there for him in the world,\u201d Hissrich says. \u201cThis is where his storyline [intersects] with other characters, because they will introduce things to him that make him think he has a greater purpose or destiny.\u201d", "", "Diving Deeper Into Ciri And Yennefer", "While some may be disappointed that the Netflix original series won\u2019t follow CD Projekt Red\u2019s trilogy (the games take place after the books), Hissrich did hint at some nods to it. \u201cI think that when video game fans watch, they will see some [familiar] things that they love,\u201d she teases. The new series also touches on core subjects from the games, such as moral shades of gray and the unconventional family dynamic between Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the story of a broken family, what they\u2019re after, and how they change each other,\u201d Hissrich says.", "Hissrich also gave Ciri and Yennefer more backstory to ensure viewers deeply connect with them. \u201cAs a writer, I was actually really interested in exploring Yennefer and Ciri before they met Geralt \u2013 what their path looked like, how they became the people that we meet in the book, their strengths, their vulnerabilities, their secrets,\u201d Hissrich says. \u201cIn the case of Ciri, what she\u2019s running from and what she\u2019s running toward. And in the case of Yennefer, what emptiness she\u2019s looking to fill inside when she\u2019s such an incredibly powerful sorceress.\u201d Hissrich revealed a bit more on Yennefer\u2019s expanded role: \u201cYou get little glimpses of her past and the disability that she struggled with as a child. We wanted to let the audience experience that with Yennefer, as opposed to just hearing about it.\u201d", "However, don\u2019t take that to mean the series is going off-script from its source material; Hissrich assures us that the show is staying true to the spirit of the novels. \u201cWe are honoring the macro journeys that all of these characters take in the books, but occasionally we go on little side quests,\u201d Hissrich says. \u201cWe try to explore some parts of the books that aren\u2019t given a lot of space.\u201d Nothing is ever changed for the sake of being different. For instance, Ciri has a friend named Dora who wasn\u2019t in the books. \u201cThis is because Ciri is on the run throughout the entire first season,\u201d Hissrich explains. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not very interesting to see a character who\u2019s not talking to anyone. So we needed to give her someone to measure her journey against, where we created a new character for her to travel with and learn from.\u201d"], "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47", "authors": ["Features Editor", "Kimberley Is Usually Playing The Latest Rpg", "Sports Title", "Or Narrative-Driven Experience.
