We took an extensive look at the final entry in the World of Assassination trilogy for our latest Game Informer cover story, spending hours in three of the game\u2019s six levels. There\u2019s a lot to process, so let\u2019s get right into it. Here are five things that you should know about Hitman 3:", "1. It Feels Less \u2018Return Of The Jedi\u2019 And More \u2018Empire Strikes Back\u2019", "Pardon my clunky Star Wars analogy, but I feel like it\u2019s an apt comparison. Agent 47, Diana Burnwood, Lucas Gray, and others have been through a lot throughout the Hitman series, with several key relationships extending even beyond the 2016 release. After rolling credits on Hitman 2, you probably thought that things were going to be coming to a head in Hitman 3 \u2013 and you\u2019re right. Obviously, since it\u2019s the concluding entry in the trilogy, we were all expecting some major events. But even still, I suspect a lot of fans are going to be taken aback at what happens.", "Like I said, I was only able to play through about half of the upcoming game, but it ends in such a way that I really don\u2019t know where it\u2019s heading. I\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy on much of this, which makes it extremely difficult to discuss, but\u2026 yeah. Hitman exists in a world that\u2019s at once familiar and completely foreign; I can\u2019t imagine how anyone involved is going to find peace at the end of this. If you just play Hitman to throw muffins at guards and drown oligarchs in toilets, then it may not be that big of a deal. But I\u2019d imagine those other players, myself included, will be spending about half the game\u2019s run time with their stomachs tied in knots.", "2. Hitman 3 Has Some Of The Best Levels Yet", "For my money, the Hitman trilogy is home to some of the best all-around level design in games. Each of its sandboxes tells multiple stories thanks to smartly executed layouts that encourage emergent storytelling, and an overall focus on the little details that matter. Levels are meant to be replayed over and over again before they fully give up their secrets, and I\u2019m honestly in awe that IO Interactive is able to deftly encourage that without becoming repetitive. That tradition definitely continues in Hitman 3.", "The game\u2019s first mission, set in Dubai, is a bombastic intro worthy of a Mission Impossible film. It\u2019s set in the Sceptre, which is the tallest skyscraper in Hitman\u2019s world, and Agent 47 gets to explore both its lavishly decorated interior and dizzying exterior. Even as someone who isn\u2019t particularly sensitive to heights, snaking around its outside via beams and scaffolding made me a little woozy at times.", "It\u2019s a stark contrast to the second mission, a murder mystery that\u2019s set in an English Manor \u2013 one that happens to be owned by Providence member Alexa Carlisle. The layout is already great, capturing the essence of both the English countryside and a stately family home. The level is more compact than some of the places we\u2019ve explored from a purely square-footage perspective, but it\u2019s home to an expansive story. In this mission, one of the optional storylines lets Agent 47 assume the role of a private investigator who is trying to solve a murder. Agent 47 has pretended to be a barber and a real-estate agent in previous games, but this is his most ambitious attempt at putting himself in someone else\u2019s shoes. To solve the mystery, players will have to interrogate witnesses, look for clues, and piece together what actually happened. Or, you could just walk up to your target and shoot her in the face. That kind of misses the point, however.", "3. Agent 47 Has Some Nifty New Gadgets", "When you\u2019re able to dispatch enemies with weapons as varied as rubber duckies, poison, and sniper rifles, there\u2019s not really much of an incentive to add to your toolbox. Well, too bad! Hitman 3 gives Agent 47 a new tool, as well as some interesting additional options while he\u2019s in the field.", "One of the first things you do in Dubai is to scan a security keypad with a camera so that your field support can open it up for you. That\u2019s right, Agent 47 has a camera. That tool not only lets him scan keypads, but he can use it to send visual info to his handlers, such as when he\u2019s investigating the murder in England. Or, he can use it as a camera, including different visual filters and zoom levels. It\u2019s a great way to check out those little details that might otherwise pass you by. And, since the trilogy has been designed to be played seamlessly, the camera will be incorporated into legacy Hitman 1 and 2 missions, too.", "After getting passcodes, players will have to enter them digit by digit on keypads, which is a new detail for the Hitman games. It\u2019s not a world-changing event by any means, but it does make Agent 47 feel like more of an active participant in his surroundings. Similarly, he can interact with computer terminals, such as using a kiosk in Dubai\u2019s skyscraper to learn more about its construction and \u2013 more relevantly \u2013 its floorplan.", "4. It Makes Good On The \u2018World Of Assassination\u2019 Promise", "IO Interactive took a big risk with its World of Assassination plan. Starting with 2016\u2019s Hitman game, it was conceived as an umbrella under which several Hitman entries would reside. As new installments were added, they could be accessed with the same executable, giving players who bought all three a seamless experience between all entries. It didn\u2019t start smoothly, however.", "People were skeptical about the plan at launch, and publisher Square Enix wasn\u2019t quite as keen on the idea as much as IO Interactive was. Add in the fact that Hitman 2016 launched as a series of monthly episodes, and it makes sense that customers were a little wary. Now that Hitman 3 is just about here, I\u2019m able to say that the studio has absolutely delivered the goods.", "I replayed the first two Hitman games in preparation for the story and slid right into the third. One of the coolest things about the experience is how you\u2019re able to bounce between levels at will. If you play through sequentially, it\u2019s a seamless experience. As IO Interactive added new things like foliage that Agent 47 could hide in or better visual cues for surveillance cameras, the team went in and implemented those changes into the legacy missions.", "5. Save Scummers Are Going To Appreciate The New-Gen Upgrade", "Yes, Hitman 3 on new-gen consoles will have fancy lighting and reflections and all that good stuff. But the most welcome improvement \u2013 at least as I see it \u2013 comes courtesy of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S\u2019 SSDs. Thanks to their faster read-write speeds, the act of saving and loading games is much quicker than on last-gen. So? Well, if you\u2019re an unrepentant save scummer like I am, it makes a difference.", "When I play Hitman, I\u2019m always pushing my luck, seeing just how far I can manipulate guards and other A.I. as I explore and take down targets. Can I neutralize that guard even though his co-worker is just a few feet around the corner? Save. Let\u2019s see. What would happen if I threw a hammer at that guy? Save. Let\u2019s see. Those guys can\u2019t possibly know that I\u2019m not supposed to be here, right? Save. Let\u2019s see. I know there are plenty of people who love to live with the consequences of their actions. I\u2019m not among them. And now I\u2019ll save more than my progress.", "And before you judge, Mattias Engstrom, Hitman 3\u2019s game director, gives the green light to my fellow save scummers: \u201cThat\u2019s part of the gameplay, so don\u2019t apologize,\u201d he told me. Then again, maybe he was just trying to make me feel better. Oh well."], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["hitman", "lets", "47", "games", "levels", "right", "know", "save", "things", "world", "agent"], "pubDate": "2020-12-24T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
