Qassem Soleimani further proved the need for veterans in Congress. All three men lost their legs in combat.", "REP. MAST WAITS SILENTLY AFTER ASKING FOR NAMES OF ANY FALLEN AMERICANS WHOSE DEATHS DIDN'T JUSTIFY SOLEIMANI STRIKE", "The hearing Mast was alluding to had been called to discuss U.S. foreign policy with regard to Iran, following Soleimani's death and the rogue nation's retaliatory attack on American coalition forces in Iraq.", "When it came his turn to speak, Mast told lawmakers: \"If you walk out this hallway, you are going to come to several beautiful walls that have the names of our fallen service members from the war on terror. And, I would ask: can any of you provide me one name on that wall that doesn't justify killing Soleimani?\" he asked to resounding silence.", "\"I got two minutes and 30 seconds,\" the Florida Republican continued. \"I'll be more than happy to sit here and wait.
