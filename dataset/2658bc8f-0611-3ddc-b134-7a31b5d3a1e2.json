In the 1950s the Somoza family dictatorship pulled off Latin America\u2019s first parent-to-child transfer of power in almost a century. In 1979 Daniel Ortega banished the Somozas in a revolution. Today the autocratic Ortegas rule Nicaragua. Rosario Murillo, the vice-president, is Mr Ortega\u2019s wife; their children run television channels. But neither clan comes close to the influence of the Chamorros over the past 150 years. They have provided six presidents\u2014and may add a seventh, if elections later this year go their way.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino, a national hero, chided \u201cnefarious chamorrismo\u201d as a scourge Nicaragua needed to shed. From 1979, all three main newspapers were controlled by Chamorros.", "But the name has come to denote duty and sacrifice as well as privilege. The catalyst for the revolution in 1979 was the murder of Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro, the regime\u2019s loudest critic. His widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, ran for president and won in 1990, removing Mr Ortega from office until his return in 2007. Her son, Carlos, has become the country\u2019s most famous independent journalist. He briefly went into exile after the anti-Ortega uprising of 2018 in which 450 people were killed. But he enjoys a degree of protection, some suggest, because the pitfalls of silencing a reporter with his name are so obvious.", "In contemporary politics the name is a hindrance. One businessman winces while pondering the presidential candidacy of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro, cousin to Carlos: \u201cThe only problem is he is a Chamorro.\u201d \u201cPeople are tired of the same surnames,\u201d says a rival candidate. In her campaign in 1989 Violeta Barrios complained that the government would drop the \u201cChamorro\u201d when mentioning her, implying she was not a true custodian of her family\u2019s legacy. Today the opposite logic prevails. In a row with another aspirant, Cristiana Chamorro (daughter of Violeta), Ms Murillo described the Chamorros as an \u201copportunistic caste\u201d that \u201cthinks it deserves a crown\u201d.", "The opposition must pick a candidate by the end of May. Chamorro or not, he or she will have to beg for campaign funding from la gran capital, as Nicaragua\u2019s half-dozen squillionaire tycoons are known (the richest, Carlos Pellas, is a distant relative). Then will come the harassment and vote-rigging by Mr Ortega\u2019s henchmen and, possibly, disqualification from the ballot. A nasty game of thrones awaits."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["chamorro", "ortegas", "revolution", "looks", "carlos", "today", "politics", "chamorros", "seventh", "presidents", "violeta", "mr", "provide", "1979", "family", "nicaraguan"], "pubDate": "2021-03-31T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
