The former king famously abdicated the throne before quietly slipping out of England and marrying the socialite. George VI, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s father and Harry\u2019s great-grandfather, took over the throne.", "For her book, Pasternak tracked down Simpson\u2019s last remaining circle of intimate friends who wanted to set the record straight about her controversial life. In 2020, The Gotham Group announced it will produce a film based on the publication, Deadline.com reported.", "MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY\u2019S LEAKED CONVERSATIONS WORRIES ROYAL FAMILY, AUTHOR CLAIMS: 'IT JUST WON'T WORK'", "The British writer told Fox News there are lessons that Markle, 39, can still learn from Simpson\u2019s life. Simpson passed away in 1986 at age 89.", "\"The one thing that Wallis never did was that she never spoke out against the royal family and she had far more reason to than Meghan Markle,\" Pasternak told Fox News. \"In her interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan talked about how there were times where it was unsurvivable. Wallis Simpson once said, \u2018Every morning my world goes to pieces on my breakfast tray,\u2019 because after the abdication, she received hate mail and death threats. She became the most hated woman in the world.\"", "Pasternak pointed out that, unlike the former \"Suits\" star, Simpson was not welcomed by 1930s Britain when she embarked on a relationship with Edward. Deadline.com shared that the opposition against Simpson was so severe that Edward surrendered the throne so he could marry the woman he loved.", "But Simpson never escaped the hatred she faced from the public. In the \u201830s, there were rumors that Simpson was a Nazi sympathizer, The New York Times reported. According to the outlet, Simpson insisted she never tried to influence Edward to regard Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich favorably. The outlet shared there was no reason for Simpson to do so because the royal \"already regarded the Germans favorably.\"", "MEGHAN MARKLE WILL LIKELY NEVER RETURN TO THE U.K., AUTHOR CLAIMS: \u2018PEOPLE IN BRITAIN DO FEEL BETRAYED BY HER\u2019", "In 1940, Edward was given the governorship of the Bahamas, where he and Simpson stayed for five years, the outlet reported. Simpson kept busy working for the Red Cross and raised money for charities. In 1956, she released her memoirs titled \"The Heart Has Its Reasons.\"", "\"She absolutely knew that she could not change public opinion,\" Pasternak explained. \"So she sought to strengthen herself. She later said all that mattered was that she knew the truth of who she was.\"", "\"Meghan is a smart, secured and emotionally savvy woman,\" Pasternak continued. \"Why is it so important to her to court public opinion? She could easily live out her fairy tale in California with her family. But speaking out only draws more public attention and criticism. I think the one thing she could learn from Wallis now is to never speak out against her in-laws.\"", "Pasternak shared that, unlike Markle, Simpson wasn\u2019t welcomed by the royal family even after she married Edward.", "MEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S CHILDHOOD BOYFRIEND DEFENDS THE DUCHESS AGAINST BULLYING ALLEGATIONS", "\"Meghan was absolutely welcomed into the fold,\" she said. \"She had this amazing wedding at Windsor Castle with all the royals present. Wallis would have killed for a tiny percentage of the effort that was made to welcome Meghan.\"", "Pasternak claimed Edward and his mother, Queen Mary, had a strained relationship after the abdication, which Simpson attempted to repair.", "\"Wallis tried desperately to create healing between Edward VIII and his mother Queen Mary,\" Pasternak claimed. \"She couldn\u2019t bear it that he was estranged from his family. In fact, she wrote to her mother-in-law, who refused to ever accept her, and said, \u2018It\u2019s such a source of sadness to me if I\u2019ve been the cause of separation between mother and son.\u2019 So she always wanted healing within the family.\"", "It wouldn\u2019t be until 1970 when the exiled duke and duchess gave a 50-minute interview to BBC journalist Kenneth Harris, The Telegraph reported. The outlet shared that on the night before the interview, Edward, then 75, got cold feet and attempted to back out. The outlet shared that the couple gave tactful responses, most likely because the royal family was also tuning in.", "PRINCE HARRY \u2018FEELS LIBERATED\u2019 STARTING A NEW LIFE IN CALIFORNIA, PAL CLAIMS: HE \u2018DOES NOT HAVE ANY REGRETS\u2019", "When asked if the couple had any regrets, Simpson said, \"about certain things.\"", "\"I wish it could have been different,\" she said. \"Naturally, we\u2019ve had some hard times. Who hasn\u2019t?\"", "Pasternak said the last remaining people who knew Simpson and Edward watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s interview with Winfrey, 67, in March \u2013 and were surprised by what they saw.", "\"It does bring up an echo of the abdication,\" said Pasternak. \"But those who knew the duke and duchess are just so appalled by Meghan\u2019s behavior. Because as I said, they feel that she had everything that Wallis didn\u2019t. Everything from the HRH title to the royal wedding, Meghan received it. And Wallis received none of those things. So of course, they feel Wallis really did deserve them.\"", "MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY PLAN TO TAKE 'TIME OFF' AFTER DAUGHTER'S BIRTH", "Pasternak also shared that on the night before Simpson married Edward, one of his aides warned her that she would never escape public scrutiny.", "\"One of his aides told her, \u2018The people hate you very much, but if you make the duke happy, everyone will forgive you,\u2019\" she said. \"And she made the duke happy for 36 years. She stood by this man and he adored her.\"", "Pasternak acknowledged that there are still misconceptions about Simpson that she hopes her book will clarify. But the one thing she hopes readers will learn is how different Simpson and Markle handled the backlash they\u2019ve endured for marrying into the royal family.", "\"Wallis Simpson was seen as pushy and hard,\" said Pasternak. \"But the woman I encountered was terribly vulnerable. She had to develop this fa\u00e7ade, which almost became like armor. Wallis accepted that she had become this hated figure. And the truth is, everybody in the world hated Wallis. But those who knew her behind closed doors loved her.\"", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "\"There are far more differences between Meghan and Wallis,\" Pasternak added. \"The circumstances are certainly similar and seem to be echoing, but the way they dealt with their situations are very, very different.\"", "After Harry, 36, and Markle married in May 2018 at Windsor Castle, the royal family seemed to welcome the Duchess of Sussex, a glamorous former TV star.
