I\u2019ve repressed much of the stressful minutiae of those days, but, when I look back, one memory comes to mind, and, surprisingly, it is not a bad one. On March 12, 2020, Chet Hanks\u2014a rapper and actor on TV shows such as \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cShameless,\u201d who is perhaps most famous for being the thirty-year-old son of the actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson\u2014took to Instagram to notify the public that his parents had contracted COVID-19. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true, my parents got coronavirus. Crazy,\u201d he said, speaking to the camera. Explaining that his father was shooting a movie in Australia when the couple tested positive for the virus, he went on, \u201cThey\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not trippin\u2019, but they\u2019re taking the necessary health precautions, obviously . . . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be too worried about,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s all gonna be all right, but I appreciate it, and just, everybody stay safe out there. Much love.\u201d", "I wasn\u2019t glad to hear that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had fallen ill, but I couldn\u2019t help but find the video funny. There was Chet Hanks\u2019s bold decision to deliver the news while inexplicably shirtless, his body crowded with tattoos (an Eye of Providence on his sternum, a Latin phrase that translates to \u201cFortune favors the bold\u201d on his upper arm), his bare, well-developed muscles as if threatening to explode out of the camera\u2019s tight frame; his puzzling choice as a white man to speak in Black English; and the fact that this look-alike of Justin Timberlake in \u201cAlpha Dog\u201d was, amazingly, the offspring of one of America\u2019s most beloved actors. In the midst of darkness, he was giving us light. It was all going to be O.K. Tom Hanks\u2019s buff, rapper son had told us it would be.", "As we now know, almost nothing turned out to be O.K. But, with the recently accelerated vaccine rollout, we are beginning to see signs of the pandemic\u2019s end, and, as if heeding a clarion call, Chet Hanks has come back to provide. On March 26th, in a short front-facing clip that he posted on Instagram, Hanks presented his predictions for the coming months. \u201cI just got this feeling, man, that this summer is, it\u2019s about to be a white-boy summer,\u201d he began, seated in the driver\u2019s seat of a car, energetically chewing a wad of gum. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about, like, Trump, you know, Nascar-type white. I\u2019m talking about me, Jon B., Jack Harlow-type white-boy summer . . . Let me know if you guys can vibe with that.\u201d In the caption, he urged people to \u201cTag a REAL vanilla king\u201d in the comments.", "The video went viral, even as confusion arose in response to the troubling ring of Hanks\u2019s catchphrase. What was he asking us to vibe with, exactly? The last few years have seen a sharp rise in violent white-supremacist actions\u2014most notably the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville and the attempted Capitol coup\u2014as well as seemingly more fratty but still plenty toxic instances of racism \u00e0 la Barstool. Despite Hanks\u2019s vague assurance that he was referring not to the kind of militant whiteness encouraged by our former President, but rather to a softer, more pretty-boy kind embodied by Jack Harlow and Jon B., a white rapper and white R. & B. singer, respectively, some unease was expressed on Twitter, especially from Black users. \u201cWhite Boy Summer? Hope y\u2019all wearing bullet proof vests in case one gets upset lol,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but somebody needs to tell Chet Hanks that \u2018white boy summer\u2019 sounds like the title of a Netflix documentary about mass shootings,\u201d another wrote. If last summer was the summer of B.L.M., was this summer, already, the time to celebrate white boys?", "In the past, Hanks had dipped his toe into something approaching political talk: during last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, he posted his support for the movement on Instagram, and paid tribute to Tiffany Miles\u2014the mother of his daughter, Michaiah\u2014who is Black. In a later Instagram clip, after Joe Biden\u2019s win, he posted an expletive-filled rant against Donald Trump. (Both posts have since been deleted; Hanks has claimed he was harassed by \u201cpro-Trump conspiracy theorists,\u201d who have also targeted his father.) And yet, Chet completists would recall that, after taking on the stage name Chet Haze in his early rapping days, Hanks was criticized for not just using the N-word but defending his right to use it, claiming that it \u201cunifies the culture of hip-hop across all races.\u201d (In 2015, he blamed the rant on his substance-abuse problem; he entered treatment that same year.) In January of 2020, in another bizarre move, he began speaking in Jamaican Patois (\u201cBig up, the whole island massive!\u201d) on the red carpet of the Golden Globes\u2014he was there on the occasion of his father\u2019s receiving the Cecil B. deMille Award for lifetime achievement\u2014and was slammed for cultural appropriation.", "Seemingly undeterred, however, Hanks kept posting white-boy-summer content on his Instagram. In a series of videos, in which he is seen shirtless and backward-capped, AirPods tucked snugly into ears, he announced some \u201crules and regs\u201d for the season. He opened with some light fashion advice (\u201cNo plaid shirts, O.K.? You can\u2019t be looking like a picnic table out here, boys . . . No Sperry topsiders. That\u2019s not the kind of white boys we\u2019re taking about, dawg.\u201d), before moving on to matters of the heart: \u201cNo calling girls smokeshows . . . that\u2019s over with . . . Bottom line here, gentlemen, is, it\u2019s time for us to evolve.\u201d In a later post, Hanks promised that he would soon address more \u201cWBS\u201d topics, among them \u201ctaking girls on dates,\u201d \u201cankle socks,\u201d \u201cHouse music,\u201d and \u201ctelling your bros \u2018I love you.\u2019 \u201d Most of the posts were figured as warnings. The message, it seemed, was that being a white boy shouldn\u2019t be a special source of pride; in Hanks\u2019s telling, white boys were a little idiotic and little pathetic, and most certainly in need of help, for which he was the self-assigned source.", "In a video posted last Sunday, Hanks turned to questions of social decorum: \u201cReally, really important, guys. As we get closer to summer and it gets hotter out, and there\u2019s pool parties and barbecues. White boys, it is not white-boy summer to get all drunk and sweaty and, you know, sunburned on your face, booze breath, going up to people that you barely fuckin\u2019 know and getting all in their personal space, O.K.?\u201d he said. Dramatically performing agitation, he continued, \u201cWe gotta stop that shit, guys. We gotta do better.\u201d", "The phrase \u201cdo better\u201d is sometimes employed in contemporary, mostly online, discourse centered on matters of social justice, either as a call-out to others, or as part of a vow taken by oneself to deepen one\u2019s awareness and improve one\u2019s behavior. Despite the very real need behind it, the phrase, I\u2019ve felt, is often used strategically\u2014say, by corporations attempting a P.R. push to cover their asses when their structural racism is revealed, or as a useful cudgel to either hasten or forestall so-called cancellations. (Last month, for instance, Sharon Osbourne used the phrase in an apology posted to Instagram, after being accused of racist behavior while serving as a panelist on CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Talk.\u201d A few days later, the network announced that she would be leaving anyway, albeit with a reported golden parachute of several million dollars.) Hanks\u2019s employment of the phrase, in any case, was telling: he appeared aware of the broader, graver, more Byzantine conversation happening around him, and was nodding at it while also differentiating himself from it. In his self-conscious lightness, he seemed to suggest he was free from all that. I\u2019m not doing anything very serious here, he seemed to be saying, except talking about whiteness as a fact, one that is more often than not embarrassing and stupid in its everyday particularities.", "Watching Hanks navigate his way through his new gambit, I felt that he was tap-dancing on thin ice. Part of my interest in his videos, I realized, stemmed from the fear that, at any moment, he might tip over from playful, open-handed fun to hard-core racism. Even though his connection to his well-liked father (who\u2014as a Twitter joke had it some years ago\u2014might even secretly be a Black man) helped defang his videos, somehow made them feel safer, the danger was nonetheless clear and present. With each new post, I wondered, was this going to be the one that crossed the line, and then I breathed a sigh of relief when it didn\u2019t.", "As I was putting what I believed were the finishing touches on this piece, on Tuesday morning, I was notified by a friend that Hanks\u2019s white-boy-summer merch had dropped. For its logo, he seemed to aim for the popular Blackletter typeface. Used by brands such as Chrome Hearts and musicians including Kanye West and Phoebe Bridgers, it also bears a similarity to the Germanic Fraktur typeface, a twist which brought white-boy summer a little too close to Proud Boy summer. (\u201cWhy is it like in prison Aryan Brotherhood font lmao,\u201d one person tweeted.) As if to reassure his followers, later that day, Hanks announced that alongside the new white-boy summer merch, he would also be dropping \u201cBlack-queen summer\u201d clothing, because, as he noted in a video, \u201cyou can\u2019t be a real ivory king without a Black queen.\u201d The W.B.S. philosophy, Hanks claimed in another video, was meant to be for everyone. \u201cThis is the epitome of not-white-boy summer: it\u2019s having any ill will or prejudice towards anybody from a different background, race, walk of life than you,\u201d he said, his cap flipped jauntily to the front. \u201cThe real vibes is just having nothing but good vibes towards everybody. Everybody. You know what I mean?\u201d"], "authors": ["Naomi Fry", "Naomi Fr", "Katy Waldma"], "keywords": ["chet", "black", "summer", "whiteboy", "hanks", "squandered", "instagram", "know", "video", "hankss", "white", "promise"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
