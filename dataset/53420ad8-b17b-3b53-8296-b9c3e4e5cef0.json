The space is warm and cozy and vaguely literary\u2014later, when we pass through her bedroom en route to her garden, 10 percent of my brain will believe her wardrobe might open up to Narnia. Barefoot in a wine-colored floral top and matching flowy pants, Swift is typing passwords into a laptop to show me the video for \u201cYou Need to Calm Down,\u201d eight days before she unleashes it on the world.", "I have a sliver of an idea what to expect. A few weeks earlier, I spent a day at the video shoot, in a dusty field-slash-junkyard north of Los Angeles. Swift had made it a sort of Big Gay Candy Mountain trailer park, a Technicolor happy place. The cast and crew wore heart-shaped sunglasses\u2014living, breathing lovey-eyes emoji\u2014and a mailbox warned, LOVE LETTERS ONLY.", "Swift and a stream of costars filmed six scenes over about a dozen hours. The singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko, known to her fans as \u201cLesbian Jesus,\u201d shot arrows at a bull\u2019s-eye. The YouTube comedian-chef Hannah Hart danced alongside Dexter Mayfield, the plus-size male model and self-described \u201cbig boy in heels.\u201d The Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon served up icy red snow cones. Swift and her close friend Todrick Hall, of Kinky Boots and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, sipped tea with the cast of Queer Eye.", "The mood was joyous and laid-back. But by the end of the day, I wasn\u2019t sure what the vignettes would add up to. There were shoot days and cameos I wouldn\u2019t observe. For security reasons, the song was never played aloud. (The cast wore ear buds.) Even the hero shot, in which Swift and Hall sauntered arm in arm through the dreamscape at golden hour, was filmed in near-total silence.", "For weeks afterward, I tried to sleuth out a theory. I started casually. There was a \u201c5\u201d on the bull\u2019s-eye, so I did a quick search to figure out what that number might mean. Immediately I was in over my head.", "Swift has a thing for symbols. I knew she had been embedding secret messages in liner notes and deploying metaphors as refrains since her self-titled debut in 2006\u2014long before her megafame made her into a symbol of pop supremacy. But I hadn\u2019t understood how coded and byzantine her body of work has become; I hadn\u2019t learned, as Swift\u2019s fans have, to see hidden meanings everywhere. For instance: In the 2017 video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d a headstone in a graveyard scene reads NILS SJOBERG, the pseudonym Swift used as her writing credit on Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d a Swedish-sounding nod to that country\u2019s pop wizards.", "After an excessive amount of ad hoc scholarship\u2014a friend joked that I could have learned Mandarin in the time I spent trying to unpack Swift\u2019s oeuvre\u2014I was no closer to a theory. Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart. Apprehending it is like grasping quantum physics.", "My first indication of what her new album, Lover, would be about came just after midnight on June 1, the beginning of Pride Month, when Swift introduced a petition in support of the federal Equality Act. This legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. (It has passed the House, but prospects in Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate are unclear.) Swift also posted a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asking him to vote yes. The request, on her personal letterhead (born in 1989. LOVES CATS.), denounced President Trump for not supporting the Equality Act. \u201cI personally reject the president\u2019s stance,\u201d Swift wrote.", "Back in the kitchen, Swift hits play. \u201cThe first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second verse is about homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts. The third verse is about successful women being pitted against each other.\u201d", "The video is, for erudite Swifties, a rich text. I had followed enough clues to correctly guess some of the other cameos\u2014Ellen DeGeneres, RuPaul, Katy Perry. I felt the satisfaction of a gamer who successfully levels up\u2014achievement unlocked! The video\u2019s final frame sends viewers to Swift\u2019s change.org petition in support of the Equality Act, which has acquired more than 400,000 signatures\u2014including those of Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014or four times the number required to elicit an official response from the White House.", "\u201cMAYBE A YEAR OR TWO AGO, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, What would you do if your son was gay?\u201d", "We are upstairs in Swift\u2019s secret garden, comfortably ensconced in a human-scale basket that is sort of shaped like a cocoon. Swift has brought up an ornate charcuterie board and is happily slathering triple-cream Brie onto sea-salt crackers. \u201cThe fact that he had to ask me . . . shocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,\u201d she says. \u201cIf my son was gay, he\u2019d be gay. I don\u2019t understand the question.\u201d", "I have pressed Swift on this topic, and her answers have been direct, not performative or scripted. I do sense that she enjoys talking to me about as much as she\u2019d enjoy a root canal\u2014but she\u2019s unfailingly polite, and when we turn to music, her face will light up and she will add little melodic phrases to her speech, clearly her preferred language.", "\u201cIf he was thinking that, I can\u2019t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,\u201d she goes on. \u201cIt was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn\u2019t been publicly clear about that.\u201d", "I understand why she was surprised; she has been sending pro-LGBTQ signals since at least 2011. Many have been subtle, but none insignificant\u2014especially for a young country star coming out of Nashville.", "In the video for her single \u201cMean\u201d (from 2010\u2019s Speak Now), we see a boy in a school locker room wearing a lavender sweater and bow tie, surrounded by football players. In \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d the first track on 1989, she sings, \u201cAnd you can want who you want. Boys and boys and girls and girls.\u201d Two years later, she donated to a fund for the newly created Stonewall National Monument and presented Ruby Rose with a GLAAD Media Award. Every night of last year\u2019s Reputation tour, she dedicated the song \u201cDress\u201d to Loie Fuller, the openly gay pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting who captured the imagination of fin-de-sie\u0300cle Paris.", "Swift, who has been criticized for keeping her politics to herself, first took an explicit stance a month before the 2018 midterms. On Instagram, she endorsed Democrats for the Tennessee Legislature and called out the Republican running for Senate, Marsha Blackburn. \u201cShe believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples,\u201d Swift wrote. \u201cShe also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.\u201d", "Swift says the post was partly to help young fans understand that if they wanted to vote, they had to register. To tell them, as she puts it, \u201cHey, just so you know, you can\u2019t just roll up.\u201d Some 65,000 new voters registered in the first 24 hours after her post, according to Vote.org.", "Trump came to Blackburn\u2019s defense the following day. \u201cShe\u2019s a tremendous woman,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m sure Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t know anything about her. Let\u2019s say I like Taylor\u2019s music about 25 percent less now, OK?\u201d", "In April, spurred by a raft of anti-LGBTQ bills in Tennessee, Swift donated $113,000 to the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. \u201cHorrendous,\u201d she says of the legislation. \u201cThey don\u2019t call it \u2018Slate of Hate\u2019 for nothing.\u201d Swift especially liked that the Tennessee Equality Project had organized a petition of faith leaders in opposition. \u201cI loved how smart it was to come at it from a religious perspective.\u201d", "Meanwhile, the \u201cCalm Down\u201d video provoked a Colorado pastor to call Swift \u201ca sinner in desperate need of a savior\u201d and warn that \u201cGod will cut her down.\u201d It also revived heated debate within LGBTQ communities about the politics of allyship and corporatization of Pride. Some critics argued Swift\u2019s pro-LGBTQ imagery and lyrics were overdue and out of the blue\u2014a reaction the new Swift scholar in me found bewildering. Had they not been paying attention?", "Nor did it strike me as out of character for Swift to leverage her power for a cause. She pulled her catalog from Spotify in 2014 over questions of artist compensation. She stared down Apple in 2015, when the company said it would not pay artists during the launch of its music service. (Apple reversed itself immediately.) As a condition of her record deal with Universal Music Group last year, the company promised that it would distribute proceeds from any sale of its Spotify shares to all of its artists. And this summer, Swift furiously called out Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, for selling her master recordings to the music manager Scooter Braun. (When I ask Swift if she tried to get her masters from Big Machine, her whole body slumps with a palpable heaviness. \u201cIt was either investing in my past or my and other artists\u2019 future, and I chose the future,\u201d she says of the deal she struck with Universal.)", "Swift\u2019s blunt testimony during her 2017 sexual-assault case against a radio DJ\u2014months before the #MeToo reckoning blew open\u2014felt deeply political to me and, I imagine, many other women. Swift accused the DJ, David Mueller, of groping her under her skirt at a photo session in 2013. Her camp reported the incident to his employer, who fired him. Mueller denied the allegation, sued Swift for $3 million, and his case was thrown out. Swift countersued for a symbolic $1 and won.", "In a Colorado courtroom, Swift described the incident: \u201cHe stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek\u201d as photos were being snapped. Asked why photos of the front of her skirt didn\u2019t show this, she said, \u201cBecause my ass is located at the back of my body.\u201d Asked if she felt bad about the DJ\u2019s losing his job, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I\u2019m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions\u2014not mine.\u201d", "When Time included Swift on the cover of its \u201cSilence Breakers\u201d issue that year, the magazine asked how she felt during the testimony. \u201cI was angry,\u201d she said. \u201cIn that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened...I\u2019m told it was the most amount of times the word ass has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.\u201d", "Mueller has since paid Swift the dollar\u2014with a Sacagawea coin. \u201cHe was trolling me, implying that I was self-righteous and hell-bent on angry, vengeful feminism. That\u2019s what I\u2019m inferring from him giving me a Sacagawea coin,\u201d Swift says. \u201cHey, maybe he was trying to do it in honor of a powerful Native American woman. I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Where is the coin now? \u201cMy lawyer has it.\u201d", "Watch Taylor Swift Take Over Go Ask Anna:", "I ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now? \u201cRights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn\u2019t a straight white cisgender male,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I\u2019m not a part of. It\u2019s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It\u2019s clickbait, and it\u2019s a part of my life story, and it\u2019s a part of my career arc.\u201d", "I\u2019d argue that no heterosexual woman can listen to \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d and hear only a gay anthem. \u201cCalm down\u201d is what controlling men tell women who are angry, contrary, or \u201chysterical,\u201d or, let\u2019s say, fearing for their physical safety. It is what Panic! at the Disco singer Brendon Urie says to Swift in the beginning of the \u201cME!\u201d music video, prompting her to scream, \u201cJe suis calme!\u201d", "I cannot believe it is a coincidence that Swift, a numbers geek with an affinity for dates, dropped the single\u2014whose slow, incessant bass is likely to be bumping in stadiums across the world in 2020 if she goes on tour\u2014on June 14, a certain president\u2019s birthday.", "IT'S ENLIGHTENING to read 13 years of Taylor Swift coverage\u2014all the big reviews, all the big profiles\u2014in one sitting. You notice things.", "How quickly Swift went from a \u201cprodigy\u201d (The New Yorker) and a \u201csongwriting savant\u201d (Rolling Stone) to a tabloid fixture, for instance. Or how suspect her ambition is made to seem once she acquires real power.", "Other plot points simply look different in the light of #MeToo. It is hard to imagine that Swift\u2019s songs about her exes would be reviewed as sensationally today. I wonder if, in 2019, any man would dare grab the microphone out of a young woman\u2019s hands at an awards show. I stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 but did review Ryan Adams\u2019s cover album of Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989.", "I ask Swift if she had always been aware of sexism. \u201cI think about this a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, I would hear people talk about sexism in the music industry, and I\u2019d be like, I don\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t understand. Then I realized that was because I was a kid. Men in the industry saw me as a kid. I was a lanky, scrawny, overexcited young girl who reminded them more of their little niece or their daughter than a successful woman in business or a colleague. The second I became a woman, in people\u2019s perception, was when I started seeing it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fine to infantilize a girl\u2019s success and say, How cute that she\u2019s having some hit songs,\u201d she goes on. \u201cHow cute that she\u2019s writing songs. But the second it becomes formidable? As soon as I started playing stadiums\u2014when I started to look like a woman\u2014that wasn\u2019t as cool anymore. It was when I started to have songs from Red come out and cross over, like \u2018I Knew You Were Trouble\u2019 and \u2018We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u2019 \u201d", "Those songs are also more assertive than the ones that came before, I say. \u201cYeah, the angle was different when I started saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Basically, you emotionally manipulated me and I didn\u2019t love it. That wasn\u2019t fun for me.\u201d", "I have to wonder if having her songwriting overlooked as her hits were picked apart and scrutinized wasn\u2019t the biggest bummer of all. Swift: \u201cI wanted to say to people, You realize writing songs is an art and a craft and not, like, an easy thing to do? Or to do well? People would act like it was a weapon I was using. Like a cheap dirty trick. Be careful, bro, she\u2019ll write a song about you. Don\u2019t stand near her. First of all, that\u2019s not how it works. Second of all, find me a time when they say that about a male artist: Be careful, girl, he\u2019ll use his experience with you to get\u2014God forbid\u2014inspiration to make art.\u201d", "Without question the tenor of the Taylor Swift Narrative changed most dramatically in July 2016, when Kim Kardashian West called her a \u201csnake\u201d on Twitter, and released video clips of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyrics to his song \u201cFamous.\u201d (No need to rehash the details here. Suffice it to say that Swift\u2019s version of events hasn\u2019t changed: She knew about some of the lyrics but not others; specifically, the words that bitch.) The posts sparked several hashtags, including #TaylorSwiftIsASnake and #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled, which quickly escalated into a months-long campaign to \u201ccancel\u201d Swift.", "To this day Swift doesn\u2019t think people grasp the repercussions of that term. \u201cA mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it\u2019s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.\u201d She adds: \u201cWhen you say someone is canceled, it\u2019s not a TV show. It\u2019s a human being. You\u2019re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.\u201d", "An overhaul was in order. \u201cI realized I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control,\u201d Swift says. \u201cI knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it\u2019s like to go through something so humiliating.\u201d", "I get a sense of the whiplash Swift experienced when I notice that, a few months into this ordeal, while she was writing the songs that would become her album Reputation\u2014and fighting off Mueller\u2019s lawsuit\u2014a portion of the media and internet began demanding to know why she hadn\u2019t un-canceled herself long enough to take a position in the presidential election.", "On that: \u201cUnfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement. He was going around saying, I\u2019m a man of the people. I\u2019m for you. I care about you. I just knew I wasn\u2019t going to help. Also, you know, the summer before that election, all people were saying was She\u2019s calculated. She\u2019s manipulative. She\u2019s not what she seems. She\u2019s a snake. She\u2019s a liar. These are the same exact insults people were hurling at Hillary. Would I be an endorsement or would I be a liability? Look, snakes of a feather flock together. Look, the two lying women. The two nasty women. Literally millions of people were telling me to disappear. So I disappeared. In many senses.\u201d", "Swift previewed Reputation in August 2017 with \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d The single came with a lyric video whose central image was an ouroboros\u2014a snake swallowing its own tail, an ancient symbol for continual renewal. Swift wiped her social-media feeds clean and began posting video snippets of a slithering snake. The song was pure bombast and high camp. (Lest there be any doubt, the chorus was an interpolation of a \u201990s camp classic, Right Said Fred\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy.\u201d) Nonetheless, most critics read it as a grenade lobbed in the general direction of Calabasas.", "One longtime Nashville critic, Brian Mansfield, had a more plausible take: She was writing sarcastically as the \u201cTaylor Swift\u201d portrayed in the media in a bid for privacy. \u201cYeah, this is the character you created for me, let me just hide behind it,\u201d she says now of the persona she created. \u201cI always used this metaphor when I was younger. I\u2019d say that with every reinvention, I never wanted to tear down my house. \u2019Cause I built this house. This house being, metaphorically, my body of work, my songwriting, my music, my catalog, my library. I just wanted to redecorate. I think a lot of people, with Reputation, would have perceived that I had torn down the house. Actually, I just built a bunker around it.\u201d", "IN MARCH, the snakes started to morph into butterflies, the vampire color palette into Easter pastels. When a superbloom of wildflowers lured a mesmerizing deluge of Painted Lady butterflies to Los Angeles, Swift marked it with an Instagram post. She attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards that night in a sequin romper and stilettos with shimmery wings attached.", "Swift announced the single \u201cME!\u201d a month later, with a large butterfly mural in Nashville. In the music video for the (conspicuously) bubblegum song, a hissing pastel-pink snake explodes into a kaleidoscope of butterflies. One flutters by the window of an apartment, where Swift is arguing in French with Urie. A record player is playing in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version of \u2018You Need to Calm Down,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Swift says. Later, in the \u201cCalm Down\u201d video, Swift wears a (fake) back tattoo of a snake swarmed by butterflies.", "We are only two songs in, people. Lover, to be released on August 23, will have a total of 18 songs. \u201cI was compiling ideas for a very long time,\u201d Swift says. \u201cWhen I started writing, I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d (We can assume the British actor Joe Alwyn, with whom Swift has been in a relationship for nearly three years, provided some of the inspiration.)", "Swift thinks Lover might be her favorite album yet. \u201cThere are so many ways in which this album feels like a new beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cThis album is really a love letter to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory.\u201d", "I have to ask Swift, given how genuinely at peace she seems, if part of her isn\u2019t thankful, if not for the Great Cancellation of 2016, then for the person she now is\u2014knowing who her friends are, knowing what\u2019s what. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through loss or embarrassment or shame, it\u2019s a grieving process with so many micro emotions in a day. One of the reasons why I didn\u2019t do interviews for Reputation was that I couldn\u2019t figure out how I felt hour to hour. Sometimes I felt like: All these things taught me something that I never could have learned in a way that didn\u2019t hurt as much. Five minutes later, I\u2019d feel like: That was horrible. Why did that have to happen? What am I supposed to take from this other than mass amounts of humiliation? And then five minutes later I\u2019d think: I think I might be happier than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d", "She goes on: \u201cIt\u2019s so strange trying to be self-aware when you\u2019ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy \u2018America\u2019s sweetheart\u2019 thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it\u2019s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that\u2019s extremely limiting.\u201d Swift leans back in the cocoon and smiles: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we\u2019re going to find positive aspects to it. We\u2019re never going to write a thank-you note.\u201d", "Though people will take the Perry-Swift burger-and-fries embrace in the \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d video as a press release that the two have mended fences, Swift says it\u2019s actually a comment on how the media pits female pop stars against one another. After Perry sent Swift an (actual) olive branch last year, Swift asked her to be in the video: \u201cShe wrote back, This makes me so emotional. I\u2019m so up for this. I want us to be that example. But let\u2019s spend some time together. Because I want it to be real. So she came over and we talked for hours.", "\u201cWe decided the metaphor for what happens in the media,\u201d Swift explains, \u201cis they pick two people and it\u2019s like they\u2019re pouring gasoline all over the floor. All that needs to happen is one false move, one false word, one misunderstanding, and a match is lit and dropped. That\u2019s what happened with us. It was: Who\u2019s better? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? The tension is so high that it becomes impossible for you to not think that the other person has something against you.\"", "Meanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group that pickets outside Swift\u2019s concerts, not the white working class in general, as some have assumed. \u201cSo many artists have them at their shows, and it\u2019s such a confounding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,\u201d she tells me. \u201cObviously I don\u2019t want to mention the actual entity, because they would get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities.\u201d", "At one point, Swift asks if I would like to hear two other songs off the new album. (Duh.) First she plays \u201cLover,\u201d the title track, coproduced by Jack Antonoff. \u201cThis has one of my favorite bridges,\u201d she says. \u201cI love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City.\u201d It\u2019s a romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget: classic Swift. \u201cMy heart\u2019s been borrowed and yours has been blue,\u201d she sings. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well to end up with you.\u201d", "Next, Swift cues up a track that \u201cplays with the idea of perception.\u201d She has often wondered how she would be written and spoken about if she were a man, \u201cso I wrote a song called \u2018The Man.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s a thought experiment of sorts: \u201cIf I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?\u201d Seconds later, Swift\u2019s earpods are pumping a synth-pop earworm into my head: \u201cI\u2019d be a fearless leader. I\u2019d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya: What\u2019s that like?\u201d", "Swift wrote the first two singles with Joel Little, best known as one of Lorde\u2019s go-to producers. (\u201cFrom a pop-songwriting point of view, she\u2019s the pinnacle,\u201d Little says of Swift.) The album is likely to include more marquee names. A portrait of the Dixie Chicks in the background of the \u201cME!\u201d video almost certainly portends a collaboration. If fans are correctly reading a button affixed to her denim jacket in a recent magazine cover, we can expect one with Drake, too.", "She recently announced a fashion collection with Stella McCartney to coincide with Lover. \u201cWe met at one of her shows,\u201d says McCartney, \u201cand then we had a girls\u2019 night and kind of jumped straight in. In London we\u2019ll go on walks and talk about everything\u2014life and love.\u201d (Swift has no further fashion ambitions at the moment. \u201cI really love my job right now,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMy focus is on music.\u201d) Oh, and that \u201c5\u201d on the bullseye? Track five is called \u201cThe Archer.\u201d", "Yet something tells me the most illuminating clue for reading both Lover and Reputation may be Loie Fuller, the dancer to whom Swift paid homage on tour. As Swift noted on a Jumbotron, Fuller \u201cfought for artists to own their work.\u201d Fuller also used swirling fabric and colored lights to metamorphose onstage, playing a \u201chide-and-seek illusionist game\u201d with her audience, as one writer has put it. She became a muse to the Symbolists in Paris, where Jean Cocteau wrote that she created \u201cthe phantom of an era.\u201d The effect, said the poet Ste\u0301phane Mallarme\u0301, was a \u201cdizziness of soul made visible by an artifice.\u201d Fuller\u2019s most famous piece was \u201cSerpentine Dance.\u201d Another was \u201cButterfly Dance.\u201d", "SWIFT HAS HAD almost no downtime since late 2017, but what little she does have is divided among New York, Nashville, Los Angeles, and Rhode Island, where she keeps homes\u2014plus London. In an essay earlier this year, she revealed that her mother, Andrea Swift, is fighting cancer for a second time. \u201cThere was a relapse that happened,\u201d Swift says, declining to go into detail. \u201cIt\u2019s something that my family is going through.\u201d", "Later this year, she will star in a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Cats as Bombalurina, the flirtatious red cat. \u201cThey made us the size of cats by making the furniture bigger,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d be standing there and you could barely reach the seat of a chair. It was phenomenal. It made you feel like a little kid.\u201d", "But first, she will spend much of the summer holding \u201csecret sessions\u201d\u2014a tradition wherein Swift invites hundreds of fans to her various homes to preview her new music. \u201cThey\u2019ve never given me a reason to stop doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cNot a single one.\u201d", "Speaking of: Inquiring fans will want to know if Swift dropped any more clues about how to decode Lover during this interview. For you I reviewed the audio again, and there were a few things that made my newly acquired Swifty sense tingle.", "At one point she compared superstardom in the digital age to life in a dollhouse, one where voyeurs \u201ccan \u2018ship\u2019 you with who they want to \u2018ship\u2019 you with, and they can \u2018favorite\u2019 friends that you have, and they can know where you are all the time.\u201d The metaphor was precise and vivid and, well, a little too intricately rendered to be off the cuff. (Also, the \u201cME!\u201d lyric: \u201cBaby doll, when it comes to a lover. I promise that you\u2019ll never find another like me.\u201d)", "Then there was the balloon\u2014a giant gold balloon in the shape of a numeral seven that happened to float by while we were on her roof, on this, the occasion of her seventh album. \u201cIs it an L\u2019?\u201d I say. \u201cNo, because look, the string is hanging from the bottom,\u201d she says.", "It might seem an obvious symbolic gesture, deployed for this interview, except for how impossible that seems. Swift let me control the timing of nearly everything. Moreover, the gold seven wasn\u2019t floating up from the sidewalk below. It was already high in the sky, drifting slowly toward us from down the street. She would have had to control the wind, or at least to have studied it. Would Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans? This much I know: Yes, she would.", "Taylor Swift Talks Googling Herself, Which Celebrity's Closet She'd Raid, and the Bravest Thing She's Ever Done:"], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Inez"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-cover-september-2019", "keywords": ["standing", "im", "album", "scrutiny", "songs", "sexism", "swift", "swifts", "music", "say", "video", "shes", "taylor"], "summary": "Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart.\n\u201cMy lawyer has it.\u201dWatch Taylor Swift Take Over Go Ask Anna:I ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now?\nIT'S ENLIGHTENING to read 13 years of Taylor Swift coverage\u2014all the big reviews, all the big profiles\u2014in one sitting.\nI stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 but did review Ryan Adams\u2019s cover album of Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989.\nWould Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans?", "title": "Taylor Swift on Sexism, Scrutiny, and Standing Up for Herself"}
