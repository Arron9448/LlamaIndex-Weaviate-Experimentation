It also gives Democrats \u201ca little bit more opportunity\u201d to achieve a wide range of other progressive ambitions.", "Laying out a hypothetical strategy, he said the next reconciliation package could include the first piece of Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan, while future attempts might expand health coverage, provide paid family leave and support tuition-free public college.", "Now, Sanders said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to push everything into one bill\u201d.", "With Republicans vowing to obstruct much of Biden\u2019s emerging infrastructure plan and a lack of support for eliminating the filibuster, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, asked the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, the non-partisan arbiter of the chamber\u2019s rules, whether the reconciliation process could be used more than once in a fiscal year.", "They argued that the 47-year-old budget provision allowed Democrats to revise the budget blueprint they used to pass Biden\u2019s $1.9tn Covid relief bill with new instructions that would allow them to pass unrelated legislation, such as the president\u2019s infrastructure plan.", "According to Schumer\u2019s office, she agreed.", "In a statement, Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, called her opinion an \u201cimportant step forward\u201d though he cautioned that \u201csome parameters\u201d still needed to be worked out. \u201cThis key pathway is available to Democrats if needed,\u201d he concluded, while stressing that no commitment had been made to use the new tool.", "Democrats already had two more chances at reconciliation before the end of this congress in January 2023, by using budget blueprints for the next two fiscal years. But the decision by MacDonough allows them to use the tactic two more times this year, and perhaps as many times next year.", "Democrats\u2019 pursuit of this legislative gambit is a reflection of both their fragile majority and the \u201cintensity of political polarization\u201d in America, said Ross Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University and author of Is Bipartisanship Dead?", "\u201cIt is a situation very much like calling in the referee or line judge in a sports event and having her deliver the penalty kick or run the ball for a touchdown to break a tie,\u201d he said in an email. The Senate parliamentarian is being called up to resolve \u201cissues that elected officials cannot or will not solve\u201d.", "Reconciliation, established under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, was initially designed to promote deficit reduction by requiring lawmakers to \u201creconcile\u201d federal spending and revenue legislation with their budgetary goals.", "But as a result of the filibuster protection, majorities have used reconciliation to muscle through major pieces of legislation, including to overhaul welfare programs under Bill Clinton, amend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under Barack Obama and enact tax cuts under Donald Trump. Republicans also twice used reconciliation to repeal the ACA, but Obama vetoed the first attempt and the second endeavor failed to pass the Senate.", "While the opinion offers Democrats new legislative avenues, it hardly resolves all of their challenges.", "\u201cIt\u2019s always great to have options, but nothing here guarantees success,\u201d said Jim Manley, who served as an aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader.", "Reconciliation is a cumbersome and complex process, fraught with potential obstacles. It is subject to strict rules requiring that all provisions relate directly to the federal budget, which means the party won\u2019t be able to pass all of their policy objectives through this procedure. Democrats were reminded of these constraints earlier this year when a measure that would have raised the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour was stripped from the coronavirus relief bill after it was deemed inadmissible under Senate rules.", "Another potential drawback is the so-called \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d, an hours-long voting session typically weaponized by the minority to force a series of politically difficult votes that can be used as grist for future campaign attacks. However, these showdowns have become less of a deterrent, as lawmakers increasingly view the exercise as a cost of enacting consequential legislation.", "Perhaps the most daunting task will be holding their fractious 50-member caucus together. With no room for error, a single objection could derail the entire process.", "Already, the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, said he was opposed to Biden\u2019s plan to underwrite his infrastructure spending by raising the corporate tax rate.", "\u201cIf I don\u2019t vote to get on it, it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d Manchin told a West Virginia radio station this week. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have some leverage here.\u201d", "As with the filibuster, either party can take advantage of a rule change when they wield power.", "There is no precedent for using the budget reconciliation process in this way and doing so could have far-reaching consequences, Manley said.", "If Democrats attempt this maneuver now, Republicans could utilize the process to ram through new tax cuts the next time they control Congress and the White House, he said. And it may embolden them to try to stretch the rules even further.", "\u201cThere are no free shots in the Senate,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "keywords": ["provision", "infrastructure", "pass", "senate", "bidens", "reconciliation", "let", "arcane", "advance", "process", "budget", "used", "agenda", "week", "democrats"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
