The 27-year-old founder of Diaspora Co. flew here from her home in Oakland to visit the spice farmers she works with\u2014an annual sourcing trip. \u201cBut this time everybody thought I was completely crazy,\u201d she tells me over Zoom. She\u2019s in a deep-maroon Frances Austen sweater with balloon sleeves, sitting cross-legged in the corner of her hotel room, which has good Wi-Fi (no small thing in Kashmir, which recently suffered the longest internet shutdown ever in a democracy). She appears impervious to our nine-and-a-half-hour time difference and a grueling schedule that has her traversing the length and width of India. \u201cIt was at a point where I knew that I needed to reassure our farm partners that I was here, and I wanted to hear about any obstacles they were facing, pandemic-related or otherwise,\u201d she tells me. \u201cSome things just have to happen in person.\u201d", "How often have you carefully considered the vintage and provenance of your turmeric, your black pepper? \u201cI think the American consumer treats spices without interest because it seems like, Well, they\u2019re just these powders that we supposedly have to put in our food.\u201d But most of our spices are too old and nearly flavorless\u2014especially considering how flavorful they are at harvest. And much of the reason is tied up in the history of the global spice trade, born of colonialism and borne aloft by globalism. Diaspora Co.\u2019s single-origin spices\u2014which arrive in painstakingly designed glass jars, bearing each spice\u2019s harvest date alongside tasting notes, region of origin, and variety\u2014represent a new beginning, a reinvention of a spice route that rewards farmers directly for scrupulous farming, and rewards consumers with turmeric and black pepper (and more) that redefine the categories themselves. Diaspora Co.\u2019s Pragati turmeric is so fragrant it\u2019s almost intoxicating. The Aranya pepper smells like ripe fruit and tastes like smoke, chocolate, and mandarins.", "Javeri Kadri was born and raised in Mumbai by two internationally acclaimed architects\u2014her mother founded the Prix Versailles\u2013winning firm SJK, and her father joined his family firm, IMK, which built notable buildings across postcolonial Mumbai. Her parents had studied in the U.S. in the \u201980s. \u201cAnd I always heard that America was the place my mother discovered feminism\u2014where she made friends with lefties from all over the world. So it was definitely inculcated in me that I should aspire to go to school there.\u201d Javeri Kadri spent two years on a high school program in Italy, then attended Southern California\u2019s Pomona College, where she studied food and visual art.", "It was at Pomona that she was introduced to Afrofuturism. \u201cThat was so inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat Afrofuturism did was create this ability to imagine futures that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d In particular she was gripped by the thought of a future not determined by colonialism. Then the turmeric-latte fad of 2016 hit. She was working at Bi-Rite, the San Francisco\u2013based grocery store that revolutionized Bay Area grocery shopping with its nearly impeccable sourcing\u2014and yet its information on spices remained opaque. \u201cI was also realizing that the turmeric that we had in Mumbai was very different,\u201d she says. In India, turmeric had been aromatic and intense; here, it was being touted as a healing superfood, mostly due to its high levels of curcumin. \u201cBut the turmeric in most turmeric lattes was yellow dirt,\u201d she\u2019s said. \u201cIt\u2019s been on a shelf for years and has no curcumin in it.\u201d", "In early 2017, Javeri Kadri moved back to Mumbai\u2014with a pressing curiosity about the spice-supply chain, and a bit of heartbreak. \u201cI had just come out,\u201d she says. \u201cI was sad. I had been broken up with, and I moved home figuring I should research who was supplying all the turmeric for the turmeric trend.\u201d Having taken up photography at 15, she envisioned her research as photojournalism. \u201cI was thinking maybe I would do a story. But the more that I researched and the more farms I visited, the more I felt like, even if I just bought a little bit from one farmer and sold it to 10 people, it would make a difference.\u201d She showed up without an appointment at the Indian Institute of Spices Research in Kerala, where heirloom seeds of all sorts of Indian plants are preserved, and learned that most turmeric farmers didn\u2019t even know what variety they grew. She met Prabhu Kasaraneni, who practices a method called \u201czero-budget natural farming\u201d\u2014no chemical fertilizer, no pesticide, no inputs at all from off the farm. She bought 10 kilos of a variety called Pragati and returned to the U.S. with it and hired a graphic designer.", "Javeri Kadri never planned to import spices full-time. \u201cI was working two days as a line cook at Cosecha in the Bay Area,\u201d she says, \u201cjust shoveling turmeric from my little stash in my basement into jars.\u201d But a flurry of publicity in 2017, including an endorsement from cookbook author Julia Turshen, changed things. Javeri Kadri bought 350 kilos of turmeric and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the introduction of Baraka cardamom, a domesticated strain of naturally pest-resistant wild cardamom grown in the Kerala rain forest. In 2019, she added Aranya pepper and Guntur Sannam Chilies. In 2020, Diaspora was selling 10 spices. By the end of 2021, the company will carry 20, with a swag capsule collection made by South Asian fashion designers and an apron collaboration with NorBlack NorWhite on the horizon.", "Javeri Kadri seems to work endlessly. On her annual trips to India, which she makes alone, she visits every single farmer with whom she collaborates. For some she provides daylong workshops and creates networks for farmers tentative about transitioning to organic or worried about scaling up. Zeinorin Angkang, a Sivathei chili farmer in the northeastern state of Manipur, tells me that Diaspora Co. created financial incentives for farming without pesticides. \u201cSana provides a much larger profit margin,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd she pays us all at once. She also embraces indigenous farming practices, like planting yam, soy, and rice among the chilies.\u201d Javeri Kadri insists it\u2019s all both essential and worth it. \u201cThe spice trade is such a ripe system for metaphors of decolonization and social change. It was literally a system built for oppression. And so what if we can completely reimagine it to be something different?\u201d", "And while the pandemic meant stasis for many companies, Diaspora Co. has been growing, now employing a team of 10. \u201cWe\u2019re a 60 percent queer team, and it shows!\u201d she wrote me. Javeri Kadri also has a sideline in modeling, for brands such as Amour Vert, Allbirds, Frances Austen, and True & Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a great confidence-building exercise. I mean, knowing that somebody like me\u2014who was always considered lumpy and dark growing up\u2014can be in modeling is a very big thing.\u201d", "Still she sees enduring obstacles to entrepreneurs like her. \u201cUltimately, BIPOC folks still have a very, very steep hill to climb. I\u2019ve been in the food industry for a decade, and I\u2019m still not called an expert by food media.\u201d Javeri Kadri admits to sometimes feeling trapped into diversity-washing white people\u2019s work. \u201cI know that we\u2019re constantly, you know, buying and selling social capital. I\u2019m well aware of that reality. That was a lot of 2020 for me: realizing that there are people for whom Diaspora can splash a woke label over what they\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s co-opting what we\u2019re trying to do. I want people to be really excited about what we\u2019re doing because it\u2019s delicious and because it\u2019s exciting, and not because of the social capital that they gain from us.\u201d"], "authors": ["Tamar Adler", "Tamar Adle"], "keywords": ["cos", "spice", "food", "turmeric", "kadri", "diaspora", "fairtrade", "pepper", "india", "cooking", "enlighten", "spices", "farmers", "javeri"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
