The pharmaceutical industry defends high prices as a means to recoup the costs of drug discovery and development. Consumers, insurers, and governments argue that the prices charged for drugs are out of control, and bear no relationship to their real costs. But with cellular therapies the problem isn\u2019t merely profiteering\u2014it is that, unlike conventional drugs, cell therapies are inherently expensive to produce. The estimated cost to manufacture a typical CAR-T infusion is close to six figures. In short, even if CAR-T therapy were offered with no margin of profit, it would still rank with some of the most expensive procedures in medicine. Extracting cells from an individual patient, purifying them, genetically modifying them, and expanding their numbers into the millions will never be akin to churning out amoxicillin in a factory.", "When Novartis brought Kymriah to market, in 2017, it sought to offset concerns about its daunting price with an extraordinary offer: if the therapy did not work after the first month, treatment centers wouldn\u2019t be charged. That\u2019s almost unheard of in medicine, and it represents an extraordinary degree of optimism, which may or may not prove justified in the long term. June points out that we don\u2019t yet know which patients are likely to respond to the therapy. Ninety-four per cent of relapsed and chemo-resistant ALL patients treated at chop achieve a complete remission at one month; many, like Emily Whitehead, are likely cured. For a certain class of drug-resistant patients with another form of leukemia, called CLL, the response rate with CAR-T therapy is around seventy-five per cent, to judge from the most recent trial data. Eighty-five per cent of drug-resistant patients with multiple myeloma\u2014a malignancy of the blood\u2019s plasma cells\u2014have either a complete or a partial response to the therapy, but more than a third of complete responders relapse within a year. (When it comes to yet other cancers, particularly solid tumors, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer, cellular therapies have yet to produce reliable results.)", "\u201cSome of these responses don\u2019t last\u2014there\u2019s resistance\u2014and it\u2019s a big goal in the field to find the cause of resistance,\u201d June said. \u201cWe still have to run rigorous randomized studies to determine if the therapies are effective, and whether they are cost-effective, and whether they can be delivered at scale. But would you rather push the boundaries of a partially effective cellular therapy, acknowledging all its problems, yet also recognizing its clear responses? Or would you rather pay a million dollars for ineffective chemotherapies, only to pay again for cellular therapy?\u201d", "Yet June saw a downside to the fact that cellular therapies were classified as drugs: it could hinder their incremental improvement. \u201cIn the current regulatory environment, the F.D.A. approves drugs on a one-by-one basis,\u201d he observed. Procedures represent a history of small, iterative improvements. But, if you tweak the substance of a cellular therapy, it\u2019s officially a different drug, which has to undergo another gantlet of trials and agency reviews, a costly and time-consuming process.", "I asked June if he foresaw the price of the drugs coming down. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be about automation and manufacture,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf a drug remains out of the reach of the patients who really need it, why even call it a drug?\u201d", "It isn\u2019t until you witness the production of an individualized cell therapy that you grasp the scale of the challenge. At about eight o\u2019clock on a Tuesday morning last fall, I visited the Hutch and accompanied Bruce Thompson, the scientific manager, and James Adams, the operations head, as they descended two floors, into the cell-processing facility in the E sub-basement. Behind wire-mesh glass, the facility\u2019s rooms were painted a fluorescent green. \u201cWe all agreed on the color, but now we all agree that we dislike it,\u201d Adams told me, ruefully.", "I asked Thompson if I could go inside, explaining that I\u2019d been growing human cells in sterile media for more than a decade. Thompson looked at me, unmoved. He is about forty-five, broad-shouldered and soft-spoken, with the gentle but unbending manner of a vault manager at Cartier. \u201cWe have very strict anticontamination rules,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd doctors who treat the patients here are especially discouraged from walking in and out of the facility.\u201d", "Instead, I watched through the windows as a technician named Houman Bashiri\u2014in dark-blue scrubs, elastic booties, and a mask\u2014reached into an incubator, took out a flask, and held it to the light. The fluid inside was orange and turbid, with hundreds of thousands of engineered T cells. The cells had been doubling every day, Thompson said. In about a week\u2019s time, they would be infused into the patient, where, if all went well, they would multiply even more, kill malignant cells, and then remain in the body, on guard, to survey the tissues and fight any recurrence of cancer.", "The facility had thirty-five incubators, eight centrifuges, and six sterile hoods, where the cells are inspected and manipulated. Every time Bashiri added a drop of a chemical\u2014a growth factor, say\u2014he announced the action out loud. A second technician checked the chemical against the protocol and marked it off in a binder, in a maddeningly methodical process meant to guarantee that each action performed on the cells was documented and cross-checked.", "I spoke later with Thompson and Adams. \u201cIf living cells are to become drugs, they have to be manufactured under standard protocols, like drugs,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis caused tensions between the facility technicians and the doctors\u2014and the tensions still continue.\u201d Most of the doctors who ran the studies, or treated patients with the approved cell therapies, had been trained as bone-marrow transplanters. They\u2019d spent much of their careers steeped in the experimental and artisanal nature of the craft. \u201cThey were used to looking at their cells every day, and then deciding when to infuse them,\u201d Thompson went on. \u201cOne of them might come down one afternoon and say, \u2018Oh, the cells don\u2019t look quite ready yet. Why don\u2019t we give them another two days and a little squeeze of a growth factor?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cI agree there\u2019s nothing better than a good book in front of the fire, but I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the library.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping", "But each departure from the standard operating practice had the potential of violating a clinical protocol. There has to be a rule, as it were, against exceptions. What\u2019s more, untidiness, in this endeavor, can have grave consequences. \u201cEach patient gets his or her own private incubator,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat way, we can never contaminate one patient\u2019s cells with another\u2019s\u201d\u2014a mixup that could be fatal\u2014\u201cor mistake one for another.\u201d When one patient is done, the incubator is sterilized. \u201cThe suite is cleaned weekly by a specialized crew,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once a year we close down the whole facility for a top-to-bottom inspection.\u201d", "The protocols were rigorous, and yet they could not have been further from the efficiencies of mass manufacture. In this sense, CAR-T still resembles a procedure, like a mastectomy or a liver transplant; it\u2019s a matter of painstaking craft. A few months ago, at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, I watched a cardiothoracic surgeon perform a four-hour operation to replace a patient\u2019s leaky heart valve. It was a breathtakingly elegant procedure. Each move was meticulously orchestrated and controlled. The surgeon opened a fish-mouth-shaped hole in the aorta and began to stitch in the new valve. Members of the operating team assisted one another in a precise choreography. Whenever someone new entered the room, he or she checked a list to make sure that no protocol had been violated.", "For all this precision, however, other aspects of the operation\u2014call them the factory-floor aspects\u2014went undiscussed. I heard no one speak about whether the plastic in the tubing equipment could have been optimized to cut costs. Or whether the team could have worked more efficiently by altering the distance between the hooks where the sterile equipment hung. Or whether the eight-odd minutes it took to put on a gown and scrub hands could have been reduced. Would some intervention in a small, repetitive action have saved a few minutes of operating time so that, added up, the surgeon might be able to operate on one more patient a week?", "In medical school in the nineteen-nineties, I took classes on the economics of health. I learned about the overuse of medical services, the skyrocketing prices of prescription medicines, and the disparities in access to medical care that such pricing worsened. Distinctions were made between the price of a drug (how much a payer is charged for medicine), its cost (how much it takes to develop and manufacture that medicine), and its value (the actual benefit that a patient receives from a drug or procedure).", "But nowhere in these lessons did I encounter the Japanese term kaizen\u2014the continuous improvement of a manufacturing process to its leanest, most efficient form. It would have been a worthwhile lesson. Engineers in the world of industrial manufacturing obsess about this. But as doctors, as medical scientists and inventors, we are taught to think about curing deadly diseases or about creating new systems of care. We want to battle the mortal coil, not the plastic coil. We want to close the gaps in access to medical care, not the gaps between hooks in the operating room. We give priority to proofs of principle, not to the particularities of production. Yet, if the newest generations of therapies are to succeed at scale, it may be the small skirmishes that determine the outcome of the larger war. For cellular therapy to reach the masses, its innovators cannot ignore the most trivial-seeming details of the human and material factors of the manufacturing process. Perhaps we need a change in our culture, or even in our vocabulary. In Cleveland, as in operating theatres around the world, the clinicians were in yarak. The new generation of medical care will be enabled by the ceaseless demands of kaizen.", "A few days after my visit to Cleveland, I flew back to New York. At my laboratory at Columbia, Florence Borot, a postdoctoral scientist originally from Paris, is exploring another way to scale up cellular therapy. A major challenge in the manufacture of CAR-Ts is the exquisitely bespoke nature of their production: right now, every \u201cliving drug\u201d has to be made out of a patient\u2019s own cells. Borot is trying to engineer T cells so that they might be transferred from a donor to a patient who isn\u2019t an immunological match. Borot has a knack for immunological sleight of hand: she hunts through the genome to find factors that enable immune recognition and then, using new genetic technologies, makes them disappear without compromising the functions of the T cells. Variations of this strategy are being attempted by dozens of other scientists, in universities and at biotech companies. The ultimate aim is to create the so-called universal T cell\u2014a cell that has the capacity to engraft in any person\u2019s body. These cells could be grown en masse, frozen, and shipped from a central facility to a patient\u2019s hospital room.", "A second approach creates a drug from a patient\u2019s own circulating T cells, but without needing to manipulate and multiply them. An engineered molecule, called a bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE is the trade name of Amgen\u2019s candidate) is designed to tether a T cell to a cancer cell (hence \u201cbi-specific\u201d), and trigger an immune response to the cancer. These molecules would be infused into a patient and engage circulating T cells already present in the patient\u2019s blood and lymph nodes. Such T-cell engagers are currently being tested against various cancers in human trials. And there are other strategies for reducing the costly complications of \u201cliving drugs.\u201d An effort I\u2019m involved in would genetically modify a leukemia patient\u2019s noncancerous B cells, or other white blood cells, to shelter them from the effects of CAR-T. If only the cancerous cells were eradicated, the treatment would not damage the immune system, currently its most long-lasting side effect.", "The number of cell-therapy researchers, meanwhile, seems to double and redouble week by week. We present our data at conferences dedicated solely to cell engineering. We discuss methods to equip T cells or natural-killer cells with permanent immunological memory, so that they remain on constant guard against relapses of the cancer. We study ways of amplifying the effect of CAR-T therapy by combining it with checkpoint inhibitors, drugs that first became available less than a decade ago and prevent tumor cells from impeding T-cell activity. We analyze mechanisms of resistance\u2014like the occasional appearance of leukemic B cells that don\u2019t display CD19\u2014and try to engineer CAR-T cells that will not release the cytokine storms that nearly killed Bill Ludwig and Emily Whitehead."], "authors": ["Siddhartha Mukherjee", "Siddhartha Mukherje", "Jerome Groopma"], "keywords": ["therapies", "patient", "cell", "therapy", "patients", "thompson", "promise", "drugs", "cells", "drug", "cellular", "price"], "pubDate": "2019-07-22T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
