This, even though videos of old bearded men dancing at weddings are practically a subgenre on Pakistani YouTube.", "Enter Khadim Hussain Rizvi, a real-life cleric and self-appointed guardian of the Prophet\u2019s honor.", "If a character like Mr. Rizvi were shown in a feature film, he would probably be considered over the top. Mr. Rizvi, who died in November, would appear at rallies in a wheelchair wearing spotless, starched white robes and a black turban.

Mr. Rizvi latched on to a brief argument between two bearded characters in the trailer for \u201cZindagi Tamasha,\u201d during which one threatens to accuse the other of blasphemy. He claimed this was an insult to Islamic scholars, and hence an insult to Islam. He said the film would be released \u201cover my dead body.\u201d"], "authors": ["Mohammed Hanif"], "keywords": ["blasphemy", "prophet", "qadri", "insult", "film", "times", "pakistan", "york", "tlp", "sarmad", "life", "mr", "rizvi", "cant", "circus", "watch"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
