Much of the day was spent at the workplace, with a commute by train, bus, or car on either end. Often, we\u2019d have plans before and after work too: maybe an early morning spin class, or a dinner at a favorite neighborhood restaurant. Simply put: many of us weren\u2019t actually in our houses or apartments that much.", "The coronavirus pandemic changed all that. Now, much of America is working, socializing, exercising (and, well, doing mostly everything that ends in -ing) from our homes. And as we adjust the way we live, we\u2019re also adjusting the spaces we live in.", "So makes sense that, when Vogue asked several top interior designers what home trends we\u2019re likely to see in 2021, one word dominated above all: comfort. \u201cComfort, practicality, and making your home your sanctuary on every level,\u201d says Martyn Lawrence Bullard. \u201cComfort in all forms is becoming more paramount,\u201d says Timothy Corrigan. \u201cComfort over concept,\u201d says Roman and Williams co-founder Robin Standefer. \u201cThe importance of comfort, wellness, and sustainability will continue to be a priority,\u201d says Sheila Bridges.", "What does comfy look like, exactly? Think plushy, sink-into furniture, chestnut woods, warm colors, overflowing bookshelves (but not the color-coordinated kind, rather, ones stocked with tattered covers of novels you\u2019ve read and loved). Less mass-produced furniture and more reworking of passed-down family pieces or ones you already own. (There\u2019s nothing more thrilling than giving new life to ancestral pieces,\u201d says Kathryn Ireland.) Fluffy towels, luxurious candles, objets d\u2019art from local artisans rather than e-commerce giants. Essentially: \u201cThe trend is to embrace what lasts, what\u2019s well made, and what makes you smile,\u201d says Standefer.", "We will also be reworking our homes to, well, work: as offices remain closed across the country, people are investing in making their own Zoom-friendly spaces.", "As a result of our newfound focus on 24/7 livability, some previously hot trends are falling fast out of favor. The decline of mid-century modern, once the design choice du jour, continues: \u201cWhile the mid-century look was very popular, now that people are actually hanging out in their living spaces for hours at a time, there is a strong trend towards furniture that is big on soft, comfy sofas and chairs that allow you to lounge with ease,\u201d says Timothy Corrigan. Robert McKinley also predicts a similar fate for another style: minimalism. \u201cI think minimalism will begin to go by the wayside in 2021,\u201d he says. \u201cAs we spend more time in our homes, we need more objects to hold our attention. All that empty space can be suffocating.\u201d Oh, and perhaps back off the beige. \"The all-beige catalogue look is out,\u201d proclaims Ireland. \u201cBe bold and decorate with conviction.\u201d"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["timothy", "work", "think", "way", "comfort", "design", "whats", "know", "furniture", "trend", "homes", "interior", "trends", "look", "spaces", "2021and"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
