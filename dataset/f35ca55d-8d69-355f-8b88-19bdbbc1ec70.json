There was no last straw, no specific motive\u2014more a lack of occasions during which I\u2019d typically have a drink. Much of my lockdown life was spent solo in a New York studio apartment. There wasn\u2019t a roommate or friend around to clink glasses with\u2014unless you count virtually over Zoom happy hours, which felt like a forced exercise altogether. I didn\u2019t need a libation to pair with my dinner, as 80% of the time it was just overcooked penne smothered in canned Rao\u2019s marinara sauce. (Sadly, no red wine can save your tastebuds from that culinary onslaught.) So Manhattans and glasses of Malbec, once a staple on any given night in the city, became unnecessary.", "A month in, I noticed a change. My energy levels went up. My anxiety didn\u2019t exactly go down due to the whole living-through-a-global-pandemic thing, but my dopamine-dip-induced hangxiety did. I was running faster, sleeping better, writing clearer. I no longer woke up in the mornings, tinged with regret over something I did, said, or texted. Eventually, the city started returning to life. But my desire to drink didn\u2019t.", "I had officially joined the ranks of the sober-curious: those who are examining their relationship with alcohol, and wondering what their existence would be like with, well, less of it.", "Quarantine habits aside, this trend of more mindful drinking has been growing for a while. This month, an estimated one in five American drinkers will participate in Dry January. And that\u2019s just those committing to a short 30-day-stint: in 2019, a report found that 52 percent of adults wanted to reduce their alcohol intake. As a result, IWSR, an alcohol-industry tracker, estimates low and non-alcoholic drinks will grow 32.1 percent between 2018 and 2022.", "With this newfound wellness focus, a question arises: what do you drink when you\u2019re not drinking? Personally, I realized that what I miss about drinking isn\u2019t the drink itself: It\u2019s the culture that surrounds it. A diet coke is, yes, delicious, but it felt infantile at a small dinner gathering. A seltzer and lime seemed like a joyless choice when cheersing a friend\u2019s accomplishment al fresco. A date interpreted my hesitation to go out for socially distant drinks as disinterest. Then there was that one time I ordered a water. \u201cWait. . . you\u2019re not pregnant, are you?\u201d a well-meaning friend whispered. I was secure in my choice not to drink, but I was insecure when what was in my hand didn\u2019t fit the vibe of the social setting I was in.", "Enter the non-alcoholic beer, wine, or spirit. They look like alcohol, and often taste like alcohol, but aren\u2019t alcoholic. They can be enjoyed on their own, in a mixed drink, or classic cocktail. Many are culinarily acclaimed and cool: Ghia, for example, was founded by a Glossier alum, Proteau is a product from Momofuku\u2019s former bar director, and Seedlip is served at the world\u2019s best bar, Dante. Their ingredients are intriguing, with botanicals like blackcurrant, hibiscus, bitter orange. Some even have an added buzz of their own: Recess is infused with a healthy dose of CBD.", "Truthfully, I don\u2019t know how long my teetotaling will last. But I do know that whenever I want to go off the sauce, I won\u2019t be concerned by the stigma\u2014real or imagined\u2014that surrounds it. Instead, I\u2019ll just be idly sipping my Kin Euphorics spritz.", "Below, 16 non-alcoholic drinks you can buy online:"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["best", "nonalcoholic", "drinking", "dry", "youre", "didnt", "surrounds", "wine", "started", "drinks", "alcohol", "drink"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
