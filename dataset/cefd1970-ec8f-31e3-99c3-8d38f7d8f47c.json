Instead of being sent to the crusher, the car, affectionately known as Little Red, was shipped to a Colorado Ford dealer and sold to a customer with no mention of its unusual history.", "After driving it for a few years, he resold it to a man in Wyoming who later moved with it to Texas, where it eventually broke down, had parts stolen from it and ended up left on his cousin\u2019s property in the town of Weatherford.", "Barrett-Jackson CEO Craig Jackson tracked it down while doing research on another experimental Shelby he has owned for over 15 years that\u2019s nicknamed \u201cThe Green Hornet.\u201d The Green Hornet and Little Red are the only GT500-style cars Shelby built using notchback-roof Mustangs instead of the familiar fastback design.", "To put into perspective just how special these cars are, Jackson placed the Green Hornet up for auction in 2013 and received a high bid of $1.9 million, which was below his reserve price so he decided to keep it.", "While many had failed to find Little Red before him, Jackson and classic car specialist Jason Billups realized that everyone had been searching for the vehicle using its Shelby-issued serial number rather than the Ford VIN. Once they figured that out, finding where it was last registered was no problem at all.", "Although Shelby modified the car several times during testing, Jackson worked with Ford and Mustang researchers to bring it back to what\u2019s considered its ideal form, which includes a split hood scoop, side scoops, black vinyl roof and a unique independent rear suspension.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "During its time with Shelby, the car had several different engines installed, including supercharged and twin-supercharged 428 V8s, but didn\u2019t have one at all when Jackson found it.", "Jackson hasn\u2019t yet said what\u2019s under the hood today, but will be revealing that and the entire history of Little Red in a documentary that\u2019s currently in production.", "Little Red and The Green Hornet will be parked next to each other at the auction through Jan. 19, and bookended by two 2020 Ford Mustang GT500s that Jackson also owns and had painted a custom red and green to match.", "The new green one is a historic car in its own right, as it was the first 2020 GT500 built and bought by Jackson at a charity auction last year for $1.1 million.", "FOX NEWS AUTOS TESTED -- 2020 MUSTANG SHELBY GT500:"], "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
