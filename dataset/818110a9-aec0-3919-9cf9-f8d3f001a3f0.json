On Sunday evening, HBO\u2019s Watchmen\u2014at once a sequel to, and response to, that original comic\u2014aired the final episode of its first season. Today, the final issue of DC\u2019s Doomsday Clock, the 12-part comic book miniseries that combined the Watchmen and DC Universe characters, hits shelves. Somehow, 32 years after the conclusion of the original comic, Watchmen is ending all over again.", "It should be noted that the HBO series and Doomsday Clock coexist separate and apart from each other, in different fictional universes, despite in theory both emerging from the same starting point. The opening of the latter sees an apocalyptic event seemingly decimate New York City in 1992, but the television show\u2019s New York has been left unscathed since the squid attack of 1985, despite an understandable drop in tourism since. Both come at the idea of the legacy of the original from different angles, and\u2014despite some shared ideas\u2014have very different ideas about what Watchmen, as envisaged by Moore and Gibbons, actually represented.", "Of the two, Doomsday Clock is the most traditional and, ultimately, the least successful. (Those two things are, unsurprisingly, not unrelated.) There are multiple reasons for this\u2014including the fact that the series was beset by massive delays, with what was intended as a monthly serial when it launched in November 2017 quickly slipping into a bimonthly, then entirely irregular schedule\u2014but what truly doomed the project was an inability to deliver on what was, admittedly, an ambitious idea at the heart of the story.", "The original Watchmen was a comic book series that redefined what superhero comics could be, and in Doomsday Clock, writer Geoff Johns created a story that made that subtext text: Dr. Manhattan, the omniscient blue nude that dominates the original Watchmen, has visited the DC universe of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman and, unbeknownst to everyone, changed its history to create a colder, more violent world. As the series continues, however, Johns only builds on that idea in the most clich\u00e9d and conservative ways. More and more heroes appear and overwhelm the narrative as everything devolves into endless fight scenes and narration that is forced to explain the bigger ideas because they\u2019ve become lost in the action.", "Ideas aren\u2019t the only thing to get lost as the series goes along. As the cast grows, many characters who were ostensibly protagonists get pushed to the periphery, disappearing for interminably long stretches as Johns and artist Gary Frank seemingly forget about them. It\u2019s as if the DC universe itself takes over and demands more space. In the final issue, predicting Superman's future, and the futures of his fellow heroes, gets as much attention as closing out the stories of Doomsday's original stars, all of whom have become afterthoughts by accident. It\u2019s a sign of how overwhelmed Doomsday Clock becomes by the superhero status quo it seeks, not entirely successfully, to challenge and address.", "The same can\u2019t be said of HBO\u2019s Watchmen, which proved to be as intricately constructed as the comic book that inspired it, filled with mysteries and puzzles that weren\u2019t even revealed to be puzzles until their secrets were laid bare. (That Ozymandias status reveal!) If Doomsday Clock was a story interested in the meta impact of Watchmen on the comic book medium, Watchmen the show was one fascinated by the implications of the comic\u2019s facile promise of \u201csuperheroes in the real world,\u201d and something that drove directly through the ways in which the original fulfilled and failed that promise."], "keywords": ["twice", "original", "johns", "universe", "book", "watchmen", "idea", "clock", "comic", "series", "doomsday", "week", "ended", "world"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Graeme Mcmilla", "Wired Staff", "Angela Watercutter"], "summary": "For fans of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 1986 comic book series Watchmen, this week is a strange moment in time.\nToday, the final issue of DC\u2019s Doomsday Clock, the 12-part comic book miniseries that combined the Watchmen and DC Universe characters, hits shelves.\nSomehow, 32 years after the conclusion of the original comic, Watchmen is ending all over again.\nOf the two, Doomsday Clock is the most traditional and, ultimately, the least successful.\nIt\u2019s a sign of how overwhelmed Doomsday Clock becomes by the superhero status quo it seeks, not entirely successfully, to challenge and address."}
