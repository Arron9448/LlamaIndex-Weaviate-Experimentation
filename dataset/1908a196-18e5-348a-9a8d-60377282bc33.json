I deeply believe in the \u201cmarketplace of ideas,\u201d and I do think that there is a danger of a liberal monoculture in some universities, nonprofits and news organizations.

They fomented racial animus and promoted white supremacy as a response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. And, in the first two weeks after the election was called for Joe Biden, Fox News laid the groundwork for the attack on the Capitol by challenging the results on 774 individual instances with wild conspiracies and flat-out fabrications.\u201d", "In other words, the problem with Fox isn\u2019t that it\u2019s conservative but that it monetizes conspiracy theories and disinformation in ways that are sometimes lethal. Researchers have found, for example, that places where Fox News is randomly assigned a lower channel number (and thus gets more viewers) had riskier behavior during the pandemic, and that media markets where Hannity is particularly popular had higher Covid-19 death rates early in the pandemic.", "Suppose Discovery Channel went haywire and encouraged viewers to drink arsenic to lose weight?
