The smell of it is in the air all over town after a rain, and bits of soggy toilet paper and slicks of human waste cling to the grass in neighborhoods where children used to play on warm days, locals said. Kids don\u2019t play outside any more. Gardens don\u2019t grow.", "Like Smith, other locals say their water tastes odd and refuse to drink from their taps, relying on donated shipments of bottled water. They worry about the long-term health effects of living under such conditions, and they say that for years elected officials and local utility companies inadequately addressed their cries for help.", "Residents and environmental justice advocates also believe that these issues persist because the town is one of the poorest in America, with a median household income of less than $15,000 a year and almost half of residents living below the poverty line.

Its wastewater system, a combination of open drainage ditches and ageing underground pipes and pumps, feeds into networks from neighboring towns, which also experience backup and overflow issues. Leaks, floods and damage to parts of the system often go unaddressed for long periods of time, according to complaints from residents and public records.", "While neighboring cities have similar obstacles, Centreville faces a perfect storm of factors that mean confronting its sanitation crisis has at times felt insurmountable: in addition to its failing infrastructure and geography, it also must contend with temporary fixes from a slow city government that can make things worse. The city has paved over manhole covers, which have been known to spout sewer water-like geysers when the system is particularly overwhelmed. And a large sinkhole in the middle of the road in the Piat Place neighborhood, where Smith lives, is said to have gone unaddressed for about a year.", "Though Centreville was once a larger town, it has lost more than half its population and nearly all its white inhabitants since 1970.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A view of a home with a waterlogged front yard in the Piat Place neighborhood of Centreville.

Flowers hails from central Alabama, where many households lack proper plumbing and rivers of wastewater flow through back yards. \u201cThe Centreville problem ranks as one of the worst I have seen,\u201d she said.", "Centreville is distinct from many of the places Flowers has studied, from rural Alabama and the Navajo Nation to unincorporated communities in California and Texas, because it is part of a major metropolitan area.", "In Centreville, she noted, the \u201csewage is in plain sight\u201d.", "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to move out, I like my little spot.

Living in close contact with raw sewage can lead to a number of health problems, including gastrointestinal illness from bacteria and breathing difficulties from indoor mold. In the rural areas they examined, Black, Latinx and indigenous communities, as well as people in poverty, bear an outsized share of the burden, the authors wrote.", "In the pandemic, people like Smith, who lives in one of Centreville\u2019s most flood-prone areas, have been mostly confined to their water-damaged houses for months.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A condemned home sits on a waterlogged lot in the Ping Pong neighborhood of Centreville.
