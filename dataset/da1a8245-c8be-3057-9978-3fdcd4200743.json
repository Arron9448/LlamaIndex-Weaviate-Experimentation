Being able to adventure in the world of Pok\u00e9mon while being anywhere in the real world is enticing, but fans have long clamored to see the series deliver a mainline console RPG. However, developer Game Freak was reluctant to create a game that players couldn\u2019t take with them. The release of the hybrid Nintendo Switch changed everything.", "Now, unrestrained by the traditional limitations of dedicated handheld devices, Game Freak sets out to make what it considers to be the ultimate version of Pok\u00e9mon. We traveled to the team\u2019s Tokyo headquarters to learn the inspirations behind the various additions and advancements of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield.", "Walking into the unassuming Carrot Tower in Tokyo, you would never guess the creators of the highest-grossing entertainment franchise in the world were just a couple hundred feet above you. After a short elevator ride and a stroll through a plain, twisting hallway, a door opens to a conference room and you\u2019re suddenly presented with the rich history that has been made here. Lining the walls of the conference room is every game, every soundtrack, and hundreds of figures from the world\u2019s largest entertainment juggernaut.", "While the shelves housing the mainline entries of the Pok\u00e9mon series read like a history book for Nintendo\u2019s handheld devices, when you get to the end, Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee immediately stick out as the sole console entries. The games, which released last year on Nintendo\u2019s current flagship platform, effectively transitioned the series to the hybrid format. But while those reimaginings of the first-generation games served as a crowd-pleasing bridge to the next evolution of the franchise, they did more for the development teams at Game Freak.", "The Pok\u00e9mon Let\u2019s Go games served as a way for the studio to get down the development basics for Nintendo\u2019s new console \u2013 introducing new features, like wild Pok\u00e9mon appearing in the environments and a giant leap forward in terms of visuals. Fans enjoyed these games and loved having a modern remake as a starting point for the franchise on Switch, but Game Freak had greater ambitions with the new technology than simply recreating past glories.", "During the development of the Let\u2019s Go games, the team realized creating games on Switch was no small task when compared to developing on lower-resolution handheld devices. \u201cI think the biggest takeaway was how the graphics and rendering work is so different from the 3DS,\u201d says Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori. \u201cNeeding to staff up and figure out how we\u2019re able to get that to work really well on Switch takes more time, and we needed more resources.\u201d", "The studio grew in size, nearly doubling the core team since the development of Sun and Moon. With 180 to 200 core members, hundreds of outsourced and external partners, and a large marketing department, the full team is massive. When you factor in the localization teams across the nine languages the game is launching in, Ohmori estimates that around 1,000 names will appear in the credits of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield.", "Using key takeaways from the Let\u2019s Go games, the rapidly growing team at Game Freak forged ahead with its vision for the next generation of Pok\u00e9mon games. \u201cWe set out with the idea of making the ultimate, strongest, the best Pok\u00e9mon game yet, being on Nintendo Switch, the first time an all-new generation is coming to a console,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cIt was really just kind of applying this idea of \u2018ultimate\u2019 to every facet of the game: gameplay, visuals, everything. That was really the theme for when I set out making the game: the greatest Pok\u00e9mon game.\u201d", "Battling the Status Quo", "Battling the Status Quo", "To craft the \u201cultimate\u201d Pok\u00e9mon game, Game Freak put everything under a microscope. Across seven generations and five video game systems to this point, familiar battle mechanics that have stood the test of time always carry over in the series. Since the beginning, players have taken part in turn-based battles with Pok\u00e9mon that can learn up to four moves. Despite that basic formula remaining firmly in place over the years, Game Freak has explored ways to change it up.", "\u201cI think with the Pok\u00e9mon games, you\u2019re taking the elements that existed before and add onto them with every game, but we don\u2019t just take the elements for granted,\u201d says planning director Kazumasa Iwao. \u201cEach time we make a new game, we review what\u2019s there and make sure they make sense for the project and that we\u2019re confident we can make them fun for the next game.\u201d", "Why Did A Console Game Take So Long? Since the series\u2019 inception on Game Boy in the 1990s, fans have begged Game Freak for a mainline Pok\u00e9mon RPG for home consoles. Until the release of the Nintendo Switch, that project would have compromised what Game Freak considers one of the series\u2019 most important aspects. \u201cWe think it\u2019s really important to not have the experience be totally closed,\u201d says producer Junichi Masuda. \u201cHaving it facilitate the real-life interactions \u2013 playing with friends in the same space, and talking with each other \u2013 facilitating that is a part of the Pok\u00e9mon experience, rather than just what\u2019s happening on the screen. It\u2019s fun to play alone at home as well, but it\u2019s probably more fun if you\u2019re playing with friends at a festival.\u201d Masuda also points toward the in-store Pok\u00e9mon distributions that happen at retailers across the world. During these in-store events, players can bring their systems in or obtain an exclusive card to download a special Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cWe do that so you can go there to that location and you may run into a friend or meet somebody you didn\u2019t know before and connect through the game,\u201d he says. \u201cThose moments turn into memories and add value to that Pok\u00e9mon you get; every time you see it, you\u2019ll remember that experience, and we think those experiences are valuable.\u201d Now, with the Switch offering the best of both the home console and handheld worlds, Game Freak is excited to finally give fans the mainline Pok\u00e9mon RPG they\u2019ve been wanting for decades without sacrificing its desire to have the games be portable.", "According to Ohmori, the team even thought about changing up the very core of the battle system from the traditional turn-based experience, but reconsidered when thinking of the initial themes for this next entry. \u201cWith Sword and Shield, we felt like expressing the turn-based battles in their ultimate form,\u201d he says.", "With that level of willingness to re-examine the core tenets of the series, the team looked toward other ways to experiment without completely disrupting the beloved balance. Even mainstays like Pok\u00e9mon being able to learn four moves was looked at. The studio considered bumping the number of moves up to five, or even down to three, but nothing felt right.", "\u201cIf you make it five or even more than five, that makes it so a lot of the Pok\u00e9mon can really do anything, and it becomes a lot harder to read what your opponent might do because there are just that many more possibilities of moves they could use,\u201d Iwao says. \u201cI think that hurts the balance of the gameplay quite a bit. At the same time, even if you reduce it by one to three, you really start seeing there are haves and have nots in the Pok\u00e9mon world. Like, these Pok\u00e9mon are obviously way stronger than the rest of these Pok\u00e9mon. We keep coming back and finding that four is the right number for the current battle system, but it is something we revisit.\u201d", "One recent example of Game Freak changing things up with the series prior to this generation is how Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon did away with Hidden Machines (HMs). This convention, which was in place since Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, allowed players to teach moves that Pok\u00e9mon can use both in and out of battle. They acted as keys of sorts, allowing players to access new areas once they obtain the right HM and corresponding gym badge to allow them to use the ability outside of battle. In Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, those HMs were replaced by Ride Pok\u00e9mon. The team wanted to give players a higher degree of freedom in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, and as such, didn\u2019t feel the concept of HMs fit into the themes of the new game.", "While that modernization is carried over from Sun and Moon, several new elements are being introduced into Sword and Shield that differentiate it from past games. The Exp. Share item, which spreads experience points learned to all Pok\u00e9mon in your party is no more. Instead, Sword and Shield automatically spreads out the experience without an item.", "In perhaps the biggest modernization to the core elements of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, the game now autosaves. In past mainline Pok\u00e9mon games, you had to remember to stop and save occasionally or run the risk of losing substantial progress if you turned off the system or your batteries died. With Sword and Shield, players benefit from an autosave functionality that seamlessly records your progress in the background as you go. However, for those who want a more traditional Pok\u00e9mon experience of stopping the action to manually save, you can turn this feature off; I imagine that will be a popular option when it comes to facing off against Legendary Pok\u00e9mon.", "Competitive players also have a new way to fill their parties, as a new backend parameter helps players use the Pok\u00e9mon they catch from the outset of play in competitive battles. \u201cTraditionally in the series, you start with your starter Pok\u00e9mon and then you catch a lot of Pok\u00e9mon in the beginning, and those are with you throughout your whole adventure, and the player gets attached to them,\u201d Iwao says. \u201cBut a lot of times, they get into the competitive battles and they find they can\u2019t actually use those Pok\u00e9mon or they\u2019re not competitive, so they have to go out and find the exact right Pok\u00e9mon or breed them in a certain way to make sure they\u2019re viable in competitive battle.\u201d", "To address that issue, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield introduces new systems that allow your favorite Pok\u00e9mon to become useable in competitive matches. While Game Freak won\u2019t elaborate too much, Iwao says players will know it when they see it. In previous games, you could have a Pok\u00e9mon with all the right stats, but a personality that makes it a bad choice for competitive, meaning it wasn\u2019t the best choice in high-level matches. With Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, players can still breed to try and obtain the perfect specimen, but they also have ways to circumvent that problem. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of stuff in the back end introducing systems that allow players to make sure that Pok\u00e9mon they want to use in competitive battles are viable,\u201d Iwao says.", "These changes are just the start of what sets Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield apart from prior Pok\u00e9mon games, but before the team could really fit the pieces together, it needed to decide on where it would take place.", "Going To Galar", "Going To Galar", "Concepts for what is now known as Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield began floating around during the development of Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, but it wasn\u2019t until the media tour for those games that things started to click into place. While touring the world in the lead up to the release of 2016\u2019s Sun and Moon, Game Freak co-founder and Sword and Shield producer Junichi Masuda became fascinated by London and the U.K. \u201cI remember being there with the feeling of the country and I was also looking at the history and the strength the country has; that inspired me to base the region off that,\u201d he says.", "Masuda and Ohmori began kicking around ideas for a region inspired by the U.K. To brainstorm, the team turned internally to an invaluable asset: James Turner, who has been designing Pok\u00e9mon since the fifth generation of the series. While he now resides in Tokyo to work at the Game Freak headquarters, he grew up on the British countryside.", "This concept art showing the player\u2019s home was used as reference when creating the game\u2019s 3D model", "Throughout his time at Game Freak, the team spoke highly of the U.K., but it was never in serious consideration to be a region for a game. However, at a certain point, Turner began picking up on some hints that his home country might be in the running. \u201cI was working on a different project and they were beginning development on what would become Sword and Shield, and I would hear from people working on it, \u2018We have some things we want to ask you about. We need your opinion on something,\u2019 and I\u2019d be pulled away from what I was doing\u201d he says. \u201cIt became pretty clear they were thinking about England and they wanted my opinion about the English countryside or the culture and stuff like that.\u201d", "Eventually, the quick questions about England became inquiries about him joining the team for the next Pok\u00e9mon game. When it was revealed the studio was planning a region called Galar based on the U.K., Turner\u2019s brain kicked into overdrive thinking about what in the U.K. could translate into a Pok\u00e9mon game and what should be highlighted.", "Turner was named art director for the project and he began making a list of what he hoped to accomplish with the design of the new region. Having grown up away from the major cities, he knew the importance of making the countryside just right. \u201cThe greenery of the countryside, the patchwork farmlands \u2013 that\u2019s a really beautiful aspect \u2013 the pretty small towns, and the big cities as well \u2013 they can be really impressive; I wanted to get that across in the game.\u201d", "In addition to getting the beauty of the rolling hills and the impressive nature of the cities across, Turner wanted to bring a level of authenticity to the region beyond just the landmarks everyone knows from postcards. \u201cI also wanted to convey the small details that people who come from the U.K. or people who visit the U.K. a lot, they can look at them and feel familiar, and it doesn\u2019t feel like a rough interpretation, but something that is really true to the details,\u201d he says.", "One example of Turner helping the studio accomplish this came with the signboards scattered across the region. Initially, the designer of the signboards used a medieval fantasy style for the signs. Turner rejected the design in favor of pursuing something more authentic to the real-life region. He pushed the team to create something more familiar to people who have been to the U.K., recreating the kinds of fonts and color schemes used in the actual signs in Britain.", "Despite this push for authenticity in the Galar region paying homage to the U.K., Turner understands players want variety and exaggerations in the world. \u201cIt is based on the U.K., but there are more colorful locations as well within the game to create a sense of adventure,\u201d he says.", "What\u2019s In A Name?", "What\u2019s In A Name?", "Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\u2019s name draws inspiration from the setting of the Galar region, but a lot more goes into naming than just picking something related to the area. Traditionally, the names of mainline Pok\u00e9mon games have some relationship to the themes of the game or other games in the series.", "After two generations of color-based games in Red and Blue followed by Gold and Silver, Masuda thought of Ruby and Sapphire as the start of the \u201cjewel\u201d series, which concluded with the following generation\u2019s Diamond and Pearl. For Black and White, while it was technically a return to color-based naming conventions the series started with, he more wanted to represent two opposing colors. However, starting with X and Y, Masuda was presented with a unique challenge as it was the first time the games were launching worldwide simultaneously.", "\u201cWe wanted to make sure we had a title that would be shared across all the different countries, so we wouldn\u2019t have to localize the titles,\u201d Masuda says of Pok\u00e9mon X and Y. \u201cUp until then, all the titles had been localized; Red was Rouge in French. I wanted to make sure for the first title to be released worldwide at the same time, it would be a name that could be the same everywhere.\u201d", "For Sword and Shield, Masuda wanted to look toward the themes of creating the strongest, ultimate version of Pok\u00e9mon. The names Sword and Shield weren\u2019t decided until the last minute. However, the team had art for the two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon. One was a dog holding a sword in its mouth, while the other was a dog with a head shaped like a shield.", "Creating a Pok\u00e9mon With just over 800 Pok\u00e9mon currently in the National Pok\u00e9dex, the series is bound to eclipse the 1,000 mark either this generation or the following one. With so many distinct designs and styles, it\u2019s remarkable the team can continue churning them out the way it has over the last couple decades. The process of creating a Pok\u00e9mon is an intense one, often beginning with a simple request to an artist. These requests are often saying they need a concept of a Pok\u00e9mon for a particular scenario or are looking for a specific direction for a new creature. From there, the artist creates quick sketches with few details, which are shown to the team requesting to see if they\u2019re heading in the correct direction. The groups iterate on the design based on feedback, with the gaps getting longer and longer each time as the artist adds more and more detail with each iteration. For art director James Turner, who has been designing Pok\u00e9mon since Gen V, one of the major challenges is coming up with something that hasn\u2019t yet been seen in the series. \u201cThere are a lot of Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d Turner says. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like trying to park in a really crowded car park or something. You\u2019re going this way, there\u2019s a car there. You\u2019re going this way, there\u2019s a car. You\u2019re trying to find some unique space. This color scheme has been used before, this animal has been used before. You\u2019re trying to find something unique. That\u2019s important.\u201d On top of that, it\u2019s important that every aspect of a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s design has potential real-world functionality and logic behind it. \u201cYou can\u2019t just come up with a cool looking design or a cute-looking design that hasn\u2019t got any logic behind it,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThis Pok\u00e9mon has these cool, big horns, and it looks mean and tough, but why would it have those horns? How does it live? How does it exist in this environment? That\u2019s really important. If there\u2019s no meaning behind the decorations, then they\u2019re not really necessary for the design. We have to think about how this creature exists in the world and how it lives in the world.\u201d As a part of this process, only a very small percentage of concepted Pok\u00e9mon make it onto the final lineup of creatures. According to Turner, it\u2019s close to two or three out of every 10 Pok\u00e9mon drawn make that into that game. However, once a concepted Pok\u00e9mon makes it to a certain point down the design path, it\u2019s rare they\u2019re outright stopped. Many of these concerns are addressed in meetings where the teams come together and determine which concepted Pok\u00e9mon are in the game and which are out. It\u2019s not always about the design of the Pok\u00e9mon in question; sometimes it\u2019s about the game already having a new electric or rock Pok\u00e9mon and not needing another. \u201cThere are really quite detailed opinions about that kind of stuff,\u201d Turner says. \u201cWhen you see a Pok\u00e9mon at first, you think, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a cool design.\u2019 But then if you start to think about it logically: Why would it exist in this world and what role would it have? Even though they are cool designs, there can be opinions that come up that makes it, \u2018Actually that doesn\u2019t quite fit within what we want to do this time around.\u2019 There are a lot of detailed discussions.\u201d For those Pok\u00e9mon that don\u2019t make it into the game, there\u2019s good news: The \u201crejected\u201d designs often return in later games. \u201cPeople submit designs for one generation, and they don\u2019t get approved,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIt might be just because it doesn\u2019t fit within that region or it might be because the idea is not fully cooked yet. So they will go away with that design, and then the next region, the next game will start and they\u2019ll bring it back, and maybe they\u2019ve modified it a little bit, or maybe it fits better within the lineup, and those designs go ahead. I\u2019ve seen them become final Pok\u00e9mon within certain games.\u201d", "The name derived from the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon fit in with both the themes Masuda wanted to pursue, as well as the region, but it also took on new meaning for the team. \u201cWhen a person goes to choose which version they want, maybe in the back of their mind, if they had power or strength, would they use it to fight or use it to protect? Maybe deciding what they would do with power when they choose which version to get,\u201d he says.", "The final order of business when it came to naming was to decide what those Legendary dogs that inspired the names of the games should be called. \u201cThose were the last things we were able to determine. We thought it would be interesting to go back to colors with the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cOne of the things I had in my head was that in the Galar region, these were just kind of rumors; no one has actually seen them in the story. \u2018I saw this red knight or this blue knight-looking creature.\u2019 That\u2019s the myth in the region, and I had this initial idea of \u2018The Cyan\u2019 or \u2018The Magenta.\u2019 Rather than going 100-percent straight like that, we played a little bit on the sound, like \u2018Zacian\u2019 and \u2018Zamazenta,\u2019 \u2018The Cyan\u2019 and \u2018The Magenta\u2019 to make it more like a name. The actual idea is that people would be like, \u2018That Cyan!\u2019 or \u2018That Magenta!\u2019 They\u2019re describing it.\u201d", "Turning Trainers Into Stars", "Turning Trainers Into Stars", "In addition to getting the visual design to feel authentic, Game Freak wanted to embrace the sports-centric culture of the U.K. Trainers are treated like star athletes, complete with collectible League Cards. While filling your albums with League Cards from A.I. and human trainers can be a fun goal (each card even has trivia or information about the trainer\u2019s personality on the back), I enjoyed creating my own League Card, even with an extremely limited selection available in the build.", "Even before customizing my character\u2019s appearance on the card, I can choose from different backgrounds, effects, and frames. From there, I reposition my trainer on the card, and adjust their pose and facial expression before slapping a laminate coat of my choosing over the entire card.", "You can also equip your trainer with a jersey and give them a number. However, if you\u2019d rather go for a more casual look, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield gives you more customization options than has ever been seen in the series.", "Past entries let you customize your outfit by selecting a top and a bottom, but now you can take it down to a granular level. Sword and Shield\u2019s trainer customization options allow you to choose shirts, jackets, pants, dresses, socks, shoes, backpacks, hats, glasses, and gloves. You can also choose from several hairstyles to complete the look.", "The team wanted shopping in the Galar region to remind you of shopping in a fashionable street in England. \u201cThat can feel very familiar for people who live in the U.K.,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThere were a lot of bits here and there that I pulled from my own experience.\u201d", "Much like shopping in real life, you\u2019re going to want to scour all the stores possible to find the right piece to complete your outfit; you can\u2019t just go to one store and expect to see the entire collection of clothes. \u201cThere\u2019s actually different clothing brands that serve different genres of clothing, and you\u2019ll find that different towns specialize in some genres over the others,\u201d Ohmori says.", "Fashion even changes from town to town, encouraging players to bounce around to find the perfect look. \u201cBig-city fashion is different from small-city fashion, and then there are more kind of punkish towns you can visit too,\u201d Turner says.", "The tribute to British sports culture continues with stadiums full of people during big battles. This setting delivers a new kind of atmosphere not seen in mainline Pok\u00e9mon games to this point. The crowd reacts as action unfolds in the arena, including uproars, cheers, chants, and songs. The stadium itself also changes with the action, with certain things displayed on the screens around the arena, as well as music that plays.", "All of these elements brought by the Galar region felt like a natural fit for the Pok\u00e9mon series, but where it proved most valuable was in helping Game Freak begin to pull together disparate elements it wanted to implement into one cohesive vision.", "Giant Ambitions", "An early piece of concept art conveys the team\u2019s desire of portraying Pok\u00e9mon battles in the Galar region to look and feel like a sports broadcast", "Giant Ambitions", "The team had various ideas in mind for new features that could appear across the adventure, but they were nebulous and unattached. Several of the ideas they had in mind suddenly started snapping into place thanks to the idea of basing a game in a region inspired by the U.K.", "\u201cJust in general for a Pok\u00e9mon game\u2019s development and where the ideas come from, usually in our heads we have all these different ideas, existing as individual parts,\u201d Masuda says. \u201cFor example, maybe we\u2019ll have an idea for a connectivity feature, or a battle feature, or a Pok\u00e9mon, then they\u2019re kind of all existing in your head, then you\u2019ll have these moments where, for example, you\u2019re traveling or you\u2019re going to a media interview session and you\u2019ll feel the atmosphere of that location and all of it will come together like, \u2018This is a good location to feature all of these other ideas I already had in my mind.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cThere were definitely a lot of ideas,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cThere were a lot of ideas we explored for this game that we ended up not using. It all goes back to us having these individual parts swimming in our heads and finding the right one that makes sense for the game.\u201d", "Art director James Turner wanted to capture the colors and mood of the UK (including the patchwork farmland) in this concept art focusing on the homes of the player and rival", "One of those ideas that seemingly snapped into place with a U.K.-inspired region was the new Max Raid Battles. For the first all-new console game in the series, Ohmori wanted to include a feature that reminded him of his younger days playing Nintendo 64 in the same room with his friends. He began brainstorming for ways to recreate that feeling, but didn\u2019t have any great ideas. He eventually found inspiration in the mythologies of giants involved in the founding of ancient Britain.", "The result is Max Raid Battles, where players can gather together with other trainers to take on massive Pok\u00e9mon together. If the team of players can take down the giant creature, the trainers are rewarded with the opportunity to catch the defeated Pok\u00e9mon. While that may sound familiar to anyone who has played Pok\u00e9mon Go, the idea actually predates the implementation of raids in the mobile smash hit.", "\u201cThe initial concept of having cooperative battles against a Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 the raid idea \u2013 came before raids were even implemented in Pok\u00e9mon Go, but we saw Pok\u00e9mon Go implement this raid feature and how popular it was for people to get together in the same space and enjoy these cooperative experiences,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cI think there was some influence, like how in Pok\u00e9mon Go, you don\u2019t need to be a hardcore battler to enjoy the raid battles; it\u2019s really easy to invite a friend. We wanted to have that element in Sword and Shield\u2019s raid encounters as well.\u201d", "However, before raids were introduced in Pok\u00e9mon Go, this mechanic in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield was simply referred to as \u201ccooperative battles.\u201d With the term \u201craid\u201d now cemented in the lexicon of millions of Pok\u00e9mon fans across the world, Game Freak decided to play off that word to make the feature instantly recognizable for a large chunk of its fan base.", "Much like Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s raids, the battles are ranked using a star system; the more stars a raid has, the more difficult it will be for players. According to Iwao, players might be in for a rude awakening if they think they can just coast through the higher-ranked Max Raid Battles.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a kind of difficulty we haven\u2019t seen in a lot of main series Pok\u00e9mon games up until now,\u201d Iwao says. \u201cEven for me, a seasoned Pok\u00e9mon player, even if I go with one of the five-star Max Raid Battles, I can definitely run into situations where I\u2019m not able to win.\u201d", "Thankfully, you can alleviate headaches by joining up with friends or choosing raid levels appropriate for your team of Pok\u00e9mon. Even if you go into a Max Raid Battle alone, A.I. teammates will join to fight alongside you. In addition, you can also even the odds by temporarily growing your own Pok\u00e9mon to massive scales using one of Sword and Shield\u2019s centerpiece new features: Dynamax.", "Taking It To The Max", "Taking It To The Max", "While Dynamax\u2019s inspiration was a direct result of Ohmori\u2019s understanding of U.K. myths, the inclusion of Pok\u00e9mon on this scale simply wasn\u2019t possible in a satisfactory way on handheld devices. Game Freak wanted to use the higher resolution of the Switch and the larger screens of televisions to demonstrate a strong sense of scale. Not only do the enormous Pok\u00e9mon look bigger than ever before, but the small Pok\u00e9mon on the roster also look appropriately small.", "This is further on display when players use Dynamax to make their Pok\u00e9mon grow to unprecedented sizes. Seeing a Dynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon next to a trainer on a big screen shows off the scale Game Freak hoped for. Ohmori says this display would only be possible on a high-resolution platform like the Switch. \u201cOn the 3DS, if you showed some of the huge Pok\u00e9mon, the limited resolution would probably make the player character be like a single pixel or something,\u201d he says with a chuckle.", "How Different Are Sword And Shield? Pok\u00e9mon games have traditionally released in pairs, with the titles featuring some different Pok\u00e9mon and other smaller differences. For example, in Sun and Moon, the day and night cycles were reversed, affecting certain items and encounters during different parts of the cycle. Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield carry on the tradition of certain Pok\u00e9mon being exclusive to each version, but based on which version you get, the gym leaders are also affected. According to director Shigeru Ohmori, the gyms are split into a system resembling major and minor sports leagues. \u201cThere are 18 different types of gyms in the story, and depending on the version, which gyms are in the minor league and which gyms are in the major league are different,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, in Sword, the fighting-type gym will be in the major league, but in Shield, the ghost-type. The idea is that every year, the Galar region is playing and which gyms make it into the minor league versus the major league changes.\u201d For clarification on this quote from Game Freak, read this additional statement.", "The concept of having Pok\u00e9mon grow to become giants satisfied another goal of the team going into its first all-new console Pok\u00e9mon game. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing on the TV, there\u2019s probably going to be other people in the house like family or your parents,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cWe wanted to make what you were doing on the screen look impressive or something that makes it look like, if the kid is playing it and the mom comes by like, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re really doing something cool there!\u2019 Kind of like the idea of it being a sport, for example. It\u2019s impressive to watch as a sport, and maybe the kid is like a really powerful sports player.\u201d", "Outside of impressive visual sequences showcasing larger creatures and a colorful aura, Dynamaxed Pok\u00e9mon also feature much more powerful attacks. Even the most useless Pok\u00e9mon like Magikarp can suddenly become formidable through Dynamax. This mechanic replaces systems from past games like X and Y\u2019s Mega Evolutions, and Sun and Moon\u2019s Z-Moves as the powerful equalizer in battle.", "To take the new feature for a test drive, Game Freak held an internal tournament. The team came away confident that not only will competitive play embrace the Dynamax ability, but it will add an extra layer of strategy for players of all skill levels.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give the Pok\u00e9mon an item, so you can trigger it whenever and create this element of suspense or keeping people on their toes since they don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to trigger it or what Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019re going to use for it,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cIn Sun and Moon, with the Z-Moves, you had to give the Pok\u00e9mon the Z-Crystal to trigger it, so if the effect of any item goes off, you know that Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t holding a Z-Crystal and you can feel at ease and then plan your strategy around that. With Dynamax, since it doesn\u2019t require an item, you\u2019re never going to have that feeling of being at ease since you don\u2019t know that this Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t going to unleash this Dynamax power. But at the same time, it doesn\u2019t feel cheap.\u201d", "While some fans have expressed concern that the Dynamax mechanic might be overpowered in its ability to change the course of matches, by installing a three-turn limit for the transformation, Game Freak thinks it has struck the right balance. \u201cFor a long time, we were going back and forth between three turns and two turns,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cIt sounds like a small difference, but it\u2019s a huge thing we had to work with the balance. Also, tweaking the strength of the moves. Just working with the battle design staff to get that balance right. It took a very long time.\u201d", "In addition, if a trainer Dynamaxes a Pok\u00e9mon, it tips off their opponent as to what\u2019s coming, allowing them to prepare for the approaching storm. \u201cTechnically you can switch out your Pok\u00e9mon after you\u2019ve Dynamaxed or just defend, but since that\u2019s a waste of the Dynamax, the expectation is that you\u2019re going to attack to take advantage of that power,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cThat allows your opponent to read what you\u2019re going to do, so that gives a little bit of balance there.\u201d", "Dynamax is sure to play a massive role in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, but it\u2019s not the only way Pok\u00e9mon can grow exponentially during battle. Every Pok\u00e9mon can use Dynamax to power up, but a certain subset can take the concept further through a special variation called Gigantamax. Much like Dynamax, this causes the Pok\u00e9mon to rapidly grow in size. However, it\u2019s not simply a power boost. In addition to visually changing the Gigantamaxed Pok\u00e9mon beyond what Dynamax does, this new form grants different attributes. This means that for some Pok\u00e9mon that have the ability to use both Gigantamax and Dynamax, the trainer must have the awareness to correctly determine which transformation to use for their current battle situation.", "These transformations are more than just gameplay mechanics in Sword and Shield. In fact, Professor Magnolia is specialized in researching the Dynamax phenomenon in the Galar region. These transformations are sure to be centerpieces of not just the gameplay, but the narrative as well.", "\u201cThe lore of the land is that the Galar region has this sort of mysterious energy that can power up things and make them massive, and we express that through the battle system; when they get bigger, they become stronger,\u201d Iwao says.", "Going Wild", "Going Wild", "While Dynamax is something Game Freak says wouldn\u2019t be possible on older hardware, the new Wild Area brings several technological advancements together into a vast expanse within the Galar region \u2013 a wide-open space where players can roam freely and catch Pok\u00e9mon. However, it combines both synchronous and asynchronous connections to other players to populate the area with trainers from both online and local sessions.", "In addition, players can meet up to trade, battle, or cooperate in the aforementioned Max Raid Battles, all of which is seamlessly autosaved as you play. \u201cWe\u2019re only able to do this because we\u2019ve figured out all these technologies and figured out how to make it work, making sure we can have this kind of online matchmaking happen in the background while you\u2019re walking around and not interrupt the player,\u201d Masuda says. \u201cTraditionally when the trade would happen, you\u2019d have a hard save screen where you\u2019d stop right there and save the game, but we\u2019ve finally made a way to make saving happen in the background seamlessly without data being corrupted. Even though it looks like a super simple feature, it\u2019s actually been a lot of work behind getting it to actually work in the game.\u201d", "The Wild Area also plays host to Pok\u00e9mon Camps, another new feature in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. As players roam the expanse of the Wild Area, they can set up camps for them and their Pok\u00e9mon. Once in a camp, you can let your party of six Pok\u00e9mon out to play. In addition to interacting with the Pok\u00e9mon directly through throwing balls for them to fetch or brushing them, you can also watch them interact with each other.", "You can also cook for yourself and your Pok\u00e9mon. Based on the ingredients you use and how good you are at the cooking minigame, you can make different versions of curry with rice. Other players can join you in camp to help you cook and eat with you. Game Freak teases that eating with other trainers can have definite benefits.", "The Cost of Advancement", "The myriad advancements of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield are exciting, but a few months ago, the games made headlines for what\u2019s not going to be in them. During E3 in June, Masuda stated that not every Pok\u00e9mon from the past will be able to be imported into Sword and Shield. This caused many members of the community to express their disappointment that their favorite Pok\u00e9mon might be left out from the first all-new generation to appear on consoles.", "When I ask Masuda about the Pok\u00e9mon not making the journey to the Galar region for Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, he says having so many Pok\u00e9mon with each passing generation has become nearly unmanageable if the team wants to continue implementing new features.", "\u201cUp until now, we\u2019ve been proud we\u2019ve been able to include so many Pok\u00e9mon in the games, but as a result of that, there\u2019s actually been quite a few features or gameplay ideas that we\u2019ve had to abandon in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing forward, thinking about the future of Pok\u00e9mon, we want to prioritize all those new gameplay ideas, and want to challenge ourselves at Game Freak to create new ways to enjoy the game. That\u2019s really what drove the decision for this new direction.\u201d", "While he won\u2019t elaborate on how many or which ones didn\u2019t make the cut, Masuda says the decision was a result of collaborative talks with Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company. According to the producer, the decisions surrounding this move weren\u2019t easy. \u201cA wide variety of discussions happened; it\u2019s not just one kind of criteria for deciding the Pok\u00e9mon are going to appear in the games, but a lot of different reasons, a lot of different directions, a lot of debate over which ones would be the best in the game,\u201d Masuda says. \u201cI think one example of that is figuring out the Pok\u00e9mon that would make sense for the setting of the game the most; these Pok\u00e9mon look like they could live in the Galar region. We really spent a lot of effort deciding which would best fit the setting of the adventure and the features that we wanted to implement. I think players will be satisfied. There\u2019s quite a few Pok\u00e9mon that you\u2019ll encounter in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex, so I think players will have fun seeing all the Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d", "While it\u2019s disappointing to be potentially unable to import your favorite Pok\u00e9mon from a past game, there is an additional silver lining outside of the new features this enables Game Freak to implement going forward.", "When I ask Masuda if the cut Pok\u00e9mon will return in the future, he leaves little doubt. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can look forward to seeing Pok\u00e9mon that don\u2019t appear in these games appearing in different regions in future games. I think Pok\u00e9mon Home, for a lot of players, will serve as a launching pad to gather them all there and then embark on future adventures.\u201d", "The Ultimate Pok\u00e9mon Game", "On the surface, Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield may look like just an upgraded version of the mainline Pok\u00e9mon games to this point, but several changes and upgrades have helped Game Freak come closer to realizing its mission of creating the best Pok\u00e9mon game to date. With improved hardware, a fully realized region to explore, and exciting new mechanics and ways to battle \u2013 not to mention an entire new generation of Pok\u00e9mon to encounter, catch, and battle \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield certainly has the potential to deliver on Game Freak\u2019s lofty ambitions.
