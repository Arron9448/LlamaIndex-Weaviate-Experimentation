video must've been recorded", "in the before times.", "I'm Lauren Goode.", "I'm a Senior Writer at WIRED.", "I'm also the host of the new Get Wired podcast,", "and I'm absolutely thrilled to be welcoming", "Sarah Friar to our virtual WIRED 25 event this year,", "Sarah has a long impressive career in tech and finance.", "She's worked for Goldman Sachs, Salesforce.", "She was this Chief Financial Officer of Square", "for several years, and now she is", "the Chief Executive of Nextdoor.", "She also sits on the Boards of Walmart and Slack.", "Sarah, thank you so much for joining me today", "in our virtual environment.", "Lauren, thank you.", "It is such a delight, and I too was having", "those same feelings of nostalgia", "of getting together in real life,", "and that's what we all love about our neighborhoods.", "Absolutely, and in years past, of course,", "we would do this event in real life,", "but now we're doing this, and we hope to bring you", "some really great programming and some great conversations.", "So for those of you who don't know,", "what we just saw was an ad for Nextdoor.", "And there are probably some people listening", "who aren't on Nextdoor or are a little bit familiar with it.", "The comparison I most often hear when people say,", "what is Nextdoor?", "Someone says, Well, it's kind of like Facebook", "for your neighborhood.", "And I think that has a lot to do with the design of it.", "You know, the fact that it's new,", "but I would love to hear your thoughts", "on that comparison and particularly how you feel", "being compared to Facebook", "in a time when our relationship with Facebook", "is a little bit fraught.", "Sure, so for those of you not using Nextdoor,", "Nextdoor is the neighborhood hub.", "It is the place to go to tap into what's going on locally.", "And of course we know that local", "has never been more important as people are staying at home,", "working from home, and have seen so much of the need", "to reach out during this crisis", "to the people that live around them.", "Nextdoor is the way to do that.", "So if you're not on the platform, please come join us.", "In terms of the comparison to other social media platforms,", "we do think we're very different.", "Our purpose at Nextdoor is to cultivate a kinder world", "where everyone has a neighborhood to rely on.", "And so we really think of ourselves as the humane platform,", "the place where people are really coming together for good.", "In order to do that, we are bringing together", "people who don't already know each other.", "It's a very different graph.", "So it's not your friend graph.", "It's not your professional graph.", "It is literally the people who have,", "what they have in common with you is proximity.", "And in times of crisis, that's actually incredibly important", "because those are the people that can show up at your door", "and go grab a prescription.", "They're people like me who have,", "are privileged to be healthy,", "who can go out and go to the supermarket", "for say an elderly neighbor.", "And we think it's important", "that you're not in a thought bubble.", "You are literally meeting people who are very diverse", "and different from you and sharing opinions", "and starting to get, garner empathy for one another.", "And one of the things that you've said in the past too,", "is that one of the differentiators", "is that you authenticate people in a different way", "when they join the platform.", "You're verifying them in a certain way.", "Talk a little bit about how that happens,", "and also ultimately how you grow a business like that", "when there are these intentional barriers put up", "to people joining the community.", "Yeah, so we always say Nextdoor was founded in trust.", "So as you just noted, we do take the time to verify", "that you're a real person at a real address.", "There's no bots.", "There's no fake people, no avatars or trolls", "because you're really there with your real name.", "And that's important because that starts to build trust", "and accountability.", "So that, that is a big part of our ethos.", "You're right that there are times", "when we will take the road less trodden,", "so it isn't just growth at any cost.", "It's very intentional growth.", "There are other parts of our platform", "where we intentionally slow people down.", "In fact, as we see conversations get more heated,", "we often will interject something", "called our kindness reminder.", "It's a piece of technology that we worked on", "with a bunch of amazing social scientists", "to effectively slow people down.", "Often when they're here in this part of their brain,", "dinosaur brain, I'm bringing them back up", "to their frontal cortex where they can think", "and really work through those biases.", "And we think it's so important,", "never be more important in fact,", "at a time when people are quite stressed,", "and so therefore potentially more on edge,", "easier to trigger, that we are reminding them", "that great neighborhoods are created with kindness.", "So those are just two examples of things we do", "that often slow down growth,", "but we think it's intentional and good growth.", "And we're still in 268,000 neighborhoods in 11 countries.", "So it certainly hasn't held us back.", "Right, and what you've said in recent interviews", "is that you have seen a fair amount of growth", "on the platform since the pandemic started,", "presumably because people are looking to their neighbors", "for resources and that sort of thing,", "but I'm glad you brought up that idea of slowing down.", "In fact, WIRED did a story on Nextdoor back in 2017,", "about some of the design changes", "that Nextdoor was making to try to slow people down.", "And particularly when it came to racial profiling, right?", "There had been activity spotted,", "particularly in the crime and safety section", "of the website where people were racial profiling.", "And it's a very real problem on the platform", "as it is on many other platforms.", "And so Nextdoor, as I understand it,", "instituted these mechanisms to basically get people to stop", "and say, Hey, wait a second.", "Are you sure you want to post that?", "And now that it's been a few years,", "and particularly when society is still so divided", "and divisive, how are you measuring", "whether or not that's working?", "How do you measure the success of these tools?", "Yes, great questions because of course", "we can all make ourselves feel good by doing things,", "but are we actually showing real material results?", "And as you point out that division and divisiveness", "and things like racial profiling are problems in society.", "And so they will expose themselves", "onto virtual environments too.", "If you take something like racial profiling,", "so for a start we've even changed the name.", "We only talk about safety now.", "We've removed the word crime", "because we think that triggers a particular thought process.", "We worked with some great academics,", "including Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt out of Stanford.", "If you all, haven't read her book Biased,", "at a minimum listen to her TED Talk", "because she talks exactly about the science", "behind slowing people down,", "and so as we have measured that impact since 2015,", "we now see that 75% less posts are made", "with racial profiling in them.", "And then of course from there, we of course moderate", "to make sure that no post, any post is is obviously amiss.", "And so we want to make sure it's not happening.", "Other examples, we've put in place", "a neighborhood pledge recently,", "really reminding people that Nextdoor", "is a community guideline platform", "where you do agree coming to our platform", "that you'll be helpful, not hurtful, for example,", "or that there's no place for hate speech or racism.", "And just that sign up is often a way", "that a human will remember,", "oh, I'm supposed to act in a certain way.", "And then beyond the kind of stick, there's also the carrot,", "Right, we don't just want to tell people what not to do.", "It's actually often far more important to norm people", "to the positive.", "What is it that works well here,", "and what do I get rewarded for?", "And so being able to use actions like a like,", "or a thank you,", "we often will use personalization to move posts", "that are really deeply meaningful neighbors,", "to neighbors up the stack.", "And as we create products like groups,", "we're able to also augment,", "here are the types of groups", "that are working well in your neighborhood.", "I literally just prior to this was listening to a neighbor", "talking about her walking group in Manhattan.", "It's a women's only walking group,", "but she talked about the camaraderie", "for someone who had moved from the Midwest,", "who's quite young in her 20's", "and really just missed human-to-human interaction.", "So they're socially distanced walking with masks on,", "but for her, it was all about the conversation", "and finding some connection.", "People are lonely.", "People are anxious, and they really are trying to find", "new ways to come together.", "And you can only do that in a in real life neighborhood way.", "'Cause you've got to live near people", "if you're going to walk with them.", "Right, that makes a lot of sense.", "So it sounds like you're seeing some measure of success", "based on some of the changes you've made", "around racial profiling.", "And I'm wondering what it is you would say to folks", "who are still a little bit hesitant", "to be on Nextdoor or maybe they're on,", "but they don't want to participate", "because they see a lot of divisive or problematic content", "or outright racist content", "that may be extremely upsetting to them.", "What's, what's sort of your,", "what's your best answer to that right now", "for people who are still a little bit resistant", "to the idea of it?", "Sure, so I would, first of all,", "give it a try.", "Come for the community, right?", "People often arrive with a utilitarian,", "something to solve.", "I need a plumber.", "I want to know the best place to grab coffee locally.", "I'd love a play date for my kids.", "A lot of people are struggling right now with kids at home,", "but stay for the community and the connectedness.", "Actually start to see that blossom,", "and we know it's happening in neighborhoods", "right across those 11 countries.", "In terms of, you know, if you're uncomfortable,", "know that we are moderating.", "So we use local leads and now local community reviewers.", "One of the things we heard really in the depths", "of what was going on around Black Lives Matter,", "right after George Floyd's killing,", "was that people wanted to have more moderation,", "and they really wanted to see the diversity", "of their community in those moderators.", "And so we've actually just launched a new program", "called community reviewers.", "I have been wowed by how many people have put their hand up", "to be a community reviewer.", "One thing we know for sure is", "the more that we get in newer members", "into those community reviewer roles,", "the better because newer members", "tend to be much more representative", "of their community at large,", "rather than say maybe our founding members.", "We love them too, but we love that our newer members", "tend to be more representative.", "So we think Nextdoor has changed a lot for the better,", "even in the last couple of years.", "So if you've tried us before,", "maybe come back and take a look again", "'cause your neighborhood needs you.", "Sorry about that.", "My cat just decided to join.", "My cat wants to be a part of the community.", "Cats are very welcome on Nextdoor.", "We find a lot of them.", "Yeah, he wants to know what's going on", "with the neighborhood cats.", "So, so you bring up content moderators,", "which is a really important topic these days.", "And you probably saw recently that YouTube,", "after saying back in March, was going to rely", "a little bit more on AI to moderate some problematic content", "just went back to humans.", "It turns out humans were very valuable", "in the jobs that we do.", "And so I'm wondering what you think,", "and it sounds like you're relying heavily on humans too,", "people in the community to moderate content.", "So I'm wondering what you see the future", "of content moderation being on platforms like yours.", "Like do we swing back towards AI", "once the technology gets better?", "Do content moderators finally become a, you know, a value,", "a valued and highly paid role in technology?", "What does the future look like?", "Sure, so we view it as a layered cake,", "and there's three layers in my cake right now.", "The first is where I started,", "which is that moderation happens at a local level.", "And we think it's really important", "because only the people who live in that neighborhood", "actually have local context, right?", "It's very hard to imagine how a company in Silicon Valley", "could possibly be moderating my dad's neighborhood", "in Northern Ireland with no context", "for what it's really like to live in that rural community.", "So that's kind of step one.", "And as I said, we're broadening those roles.", "So today a lot of the focus is content moderation,", "but our leads also fulfill many other roles.", "Like they're often the Welcome Wagoner.", "They're often the person that might get a community together", "around say local businesses.", "So we're also expanding how we think about roles over time.", "So that's kind of layer one layer.", "Layer two is technology.", "I never want to say technology is the solution to all ills,", "but it can have a very scalable part to pay play.", "And so clearly we do use machine learning", "to be able to spot, for example,", "when a conversation is starting to heat up,", "a machine can spot quickly that that's happening.", "So things like sentences get shorter,", "they start losing all punctuation.", "Often they might move to all caps for example.", "And that might be a great time to remind mid-flight,", "A to slow down.", "So interject something like our kindness reminder,", "but it might also be a great time to suggest a group", "because we know that for some people,", "they are really, really passionate", "about say civic engagement in their local neighborhood,", "but not everyone wants to talk about the new zoning law.", "And so that's a time when technology might flip you over", "into a group for example.", "And then, of course, the third layer of my three layer cake", "is internal moderation at Nextdoor.", "We have a neighborhood operations team,", "and in particular for maybe some of", "the most controversial topics,", "things like discrimination and racism,", "they go directly to our neighborhood operations team", "because we want to make sure that people", "that are perhaps most sophisticated in that review", "are taking a look at content that could be most problematic.", "So always more to do.", "It's a journey.", "It's like security,", "which I used to cover a lot", "back when I was an analyst at Goldman Sachs.", "You are never done.", "The fraudsters or the people that want to create division", "will always keep finding ways around", "and to do more, but our job is to stay ahead of them.", "And frankly, to keep bringing back to neighborhoods", "that feeling of kindness and that feeling of why", "when neighborhoods are strong, really good things happen.", "What would you say is the most interesting thing", "that you've learned about people on Nextdoor", "during the pandemic?", "Yeah, you know, that's a great question.", "I'm actually going to go back pre-pandemic", "where I literally went to every country that we are in,", "or I went to 10 out of 11.", "I didn't go to Italy, unfortunately, which was a miss.", "And what I heard that surprised me", "is actually a little negative.", "I heard a lot of people talking about loneliness", "and social isolation,", "and it wasn't just say seniors in a community", "or say a young mom who for the first time", "was home with a baby.", "It was coming across every neighbor almost that I met with", "regardless of age or whether they worked", "or didn't work, male or female.", "And so that actually started a lot of research and work", "that we've now continued through the pandemic.", "We are currently surveying neighbors in Australia,", "the UK, and the US,", "working frankly, with some of the best academics`", "on this topic of loneliness and social isolation.", "One of the first findings is that if you know six neighbors,", "or more, hopefully, but six is the magic number,", "you are much less likely to suffer", "from that feeling of being isolated", "or that anxiety that comes with it.", "So turns out that neighbors are good for your health.", "And it also does align", "with our former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy,", "came up with the best tagline,", "which is Loneliness is the equivalent of smoking", "15 cigarettes per day.", "So I do think that there is going to be a global trend,", "particularly through COVID because we're having our own", "social experiment right now,", "being trapped in our own little boxes", "without a lot of real human-to-human connection", "about just the negative impact that can have", "and how we all need to kind of fight the other way.", "Local is an easy, fast way to do it", "because you can literally go for a walk, you know,", "down your street in Manhattan.", "I can hit a more suburban community here where I live.", "And even if it's as simple as a quick wave or a greeting,", "that can really make a difference in someone's life", "if they're struggling with anxiety and social depression.", "Absolutely, Sarah, I think we only have", "a few minutes left.", "And I have some audience questions that I wanted to ask you.", "I may only be able to get to one of them,", "and by the way, you got, Best of Nextdoor,", "the Twitter account, told me to tell you hello.", "For those of you who don't know what Best of Nextdoor is,", "I recommend you go check it out.", "Check it out because they share some of the more interesting", "Nextdoor stories on Twitter.", "But let's ask this question, coming from Cruz Alvarado.", "And thank you for sending in your question, Cruz.", "How do you see the political landscape", "impacting your decisions on future projects?", "This is a great question", "because we talked about divisiveness,", "and we talked about racism.", "We didn't specifically talk about politics,", "but of course, that's top of mind", "for a lot of people right now.", "Yeah, Cruz, thank you.", "It's a great question, and it's something", "I'm spending a lot of time on as you can imagine", "with the US election and clearly even last", "with Brexit in the UK.", "It was very top of mind for our UK neighbors.", "First of all, we should probably just make clear", "that we don't allow conversations around national politics", "in the main news feed on Nextdoor.", "We just find it got too divisive, too controversial.", "So we actually asked the Neighbors,", "take that over into a group,", "and they can found their own group to talk about it,", "or probably find a group", "where people do want to talk national politics.", "On the other side, we think local politics actually has", "a really big place on Nextdoor.", "We know that often people come together in their community", "because they want to be civically-minded", "or civically-active.", "And in fact, that's one of the things", "that tends to fall away", "when communities no longer strengthen", "what are called weak ties.", "So you're not able to get a group together to say,", "Hey, we want to put, you know,", "traffic cones on this road", "because our kids are playing here,", "and we'd like to slow down the traffic.", "And so we do want that to be", "a very healthy part of Nextdoor.", "And in fact, I think it's one of the huge utilities", "that neighbors get out of it.", "So it's an interesting nuance", "of how do we ensure national moves off into a group,", "but local can really stay in the main newsfeed", "because for many people there's no local news anymore,", "no newspaper to go to.", "So it can be the way that they're finding out", "about what's going on with say the local mayor.", "We also work with a lot of public agencies", "to make sure the most recent and the best information", "is really top of mind.", "And that can be everyone from say,", "Governor Newsome here in California,", "the mayor of London, Mayor Khan,", "all the way to FEMA.", "Right now we have a lot of tropical storms and hurricanes", "moving either through Texas or up the East coast.", "We have wildfires here in California,", "and that's a really important place for government", "and often politicians to be involved", "because they're actually providing information", "that keeps neighborhoods safe.", "That makes a lot of sense.", "I will say that the wildfires have been one of the instances", "where Nextdoor has been helpful during these times,", "but it's interesting.", "You talk about sort of creating a section", "for national politics.", "I feel like we could have a whole other conversation", "about that at some point,", "but I have to wrap this up", "because we have other great WIRED 25 programming to get to.", "So Sarah Friar, CEO of Nextdoor, thank you so much", "for joining me today in this virtual WIRED 25 event.", "Thank you, Lauren.", "Really appreciate it."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords":
