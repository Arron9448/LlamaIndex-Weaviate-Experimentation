Saddam Hussein was loth to grant visas to curious Westerners, lest they see evidence of his regime\u2019s brutality. After his overthrow in 2003, the borders opened up, but war kept civilians away. Then Iraq\u2019s new rulers lowered a paper portcullis, demanding fees and the completion of myriad forms. Local middlemen offered to help\u2014for a price, of course. Oil firms coughed up thousands of dollars to get their workers in.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Last month Mustafa al-Kadhimi, the prime minister, scrapped visa requirements for visitors from 36 countries, including America, China and those in the EU .

The prime minister hopes it will also let Iraq depend less on Iran. His advisers dream of attracting expats and even tourists. Iraq is certainly safer than it used to be. A visit by Pope Francis last month went off without a hitch.", "Not everyone is happy, though. Some officials prefer Iranian to Western influence; others fear losing out on bribes. And xenophobia is still a problem. Clerics accuse the government of giving Westerners priority over pilgrims from Muslim countries that are not included in the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s discrimination and won\u2019t bring back tourism,\u201d says a cleric in the holy city of Najaf.", "The doors are not fully open yet. Iraqi consular staff say they have not been officially notified of the changes and that foreigners should still apply for visas. Mr Kadhimi\u2019s underlings don\u2019t always enforce his decrees. Spring break in Baghdad may have to wait until next year."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["getting", "open", "easier", "soon", "say", "prime", "officials", "minister", "visas", "mr", "westerners", "iraq", "month"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
