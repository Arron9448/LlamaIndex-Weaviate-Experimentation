First, there was the video for his latest single, \u201cTreat People With Kindness,\u201d which saw the singer transform into a flamboyant cabaret star with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge wearing matching glitzy Gucci looks. Then, over the weekend, Styles was spotted attending the wedding of his agent Jeff Azoff and his bride Glenne Christiaansen in Montecito, California. And while his signature flamboyant Gucci suit with a western-style bow tie would have attracted plenty of interest on its own, it was the fact Styles was spotted walking hand-in-hand with writer and director Olivia Wilde, who was wearing ethereal, full-length, floral Gucci dress, that made it a memorable style moment.", "The pair are working together on Wilde\u2019s new film Don\u2019t Worry Darling, currently filming in Los Angeles.

(Bonus points for his other accessories too: Styles went for a pair of Kurt Cobain-style white sunglasses and a paisley bandana as a face mask.) Wilde, meanwhile, wore a cropped argyle sweater, also from La Ligne, paired with brown velvet trousers and a set of low-top white Converse.
