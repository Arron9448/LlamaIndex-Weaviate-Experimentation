And his associates have talked about how he has a habit of laying his wishes between the lines. His former lawyer Michael Cohen has testified that Mr. Trump \u201cspeaks in a code\u201d when he gives orders.", "One thing that makes montage such a powerful visual device is its ability to make just these sorts of nonliteral connections between the words a speaker says and the message his audience hears.", "So the video shifted between points of view like a TV thriller. We were with Mr. Trump at the podium as he urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Then we saw his words from a hand-held video shot in the crowd, where people called out, \u201cLet\u2019s take the Capitol!\u201d We saw him close up, urging the crowd to \u201cfight like hell,\u201d then saw mobs overwhelming and cursing out police. A Jan. 6 tweet from Mr. Trump assailing Mr. Pence is pictured next to social-media video of someone at the riot with a bullhorn, announcing that very tweet.", "Of course, this narrative didn\u2019t only have a TV audience; there were also 100 senators, who were both jurors in the trial and victims in the story. We couldn\u2019t see their response because of an agreement that cameras not be allowed to show them during the proceedings. If senators were disregarding the evidence (CNN reported that some were reading books during the presentation), they didn\u2019t want to be seen on TV doing it.", "But an earlier video reel on Tuesday seemed to rattle the former president\u2019s lawyers. Rather than rebut it, they attacked it as manipulation. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to show you movies to show you that the riot happened here,\u201d said the defense lawyer David Schoen.
