White phosphorus, known as WP, is a chemical that burns fiercely in contact with air, producing thick white acrid smoke and a white light that can be useful for illumination. The high temperature at which it burns also makes it an effective incendiary device in war. Is it legal? International humanitarian law allows the use of white phosphorus in munitions for making smoke to mask troop movements and for illumination purposes. Its use as an incendiary weapon is generally understood to be forbidden in all circumstances where there is a risk to civilians, ie against military targets located amid concentrations of civilians. Its use against military targets, while permitted, is discouraged if there are other means to render enemy combatants hors de combat because of the suffering caused by phosphorus burns. It is a chemical, but is it a chemical weapon? While white phosphorus has toxic chemical properties, it is not generally used to poison or asphyxiate, the common aim of chemical weapons. For this reason, rules governing its use tend to fall under the wider provision of humanitarian law rather than specific prohibitions on chemical weapons. Peter Beaumont", "Turkey has previously said that the accusations were false. Hulusi Akar, the defence minister, said in October: \u201cIt is a fact known by everyone that there are no chemical weapons in the inventory of the Turkish armed forces.\u201d", "Trump unexpectedly gave Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria in October when he suddenly said he would withdraw US troops from the border region.
