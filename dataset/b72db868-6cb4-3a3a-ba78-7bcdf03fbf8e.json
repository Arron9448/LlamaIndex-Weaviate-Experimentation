Magenta, who\u2019d opted for a face shield in the interest of protecting her makeup, placed a Bluetooth speaker and a large paper bag with liquor, mixers, and biodegradable paper cups in the back seat. Although establishments like the Rosemont can now operate at fifty-per-cent capacity, many New Yorkers are hesitant to return to indoor restaurants and bars. A few months ago, Carson and Magenta decided to bring drag performances to their customers, who can place orders via text message or Instagram direct message.

Hi, everybody!,\u201d her Bronx accent ramped up. The crowd whooped. \u201cI\u2019m here with the Rosemont drag-delivery service,\u201d she continued. She set down the Bluetooth speaker, and Carson hit Play on his iPhone. The opening chords of Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d blared out. \u201cGive it up for . . . me!\u201d", "Magenta, who is twenty-two, treated the dads and their guests to a dizzying sequence of high kicks, spins, finger wags, and hair flips, all while lip-synching.
