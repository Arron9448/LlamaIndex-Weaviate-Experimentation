Add to this mix the inordinate amount of time we\u2019ve been spending recently in our homes, surrounded by all the stuff we\u2019ve bought over the years, thinking hard about the value\u2014both literal and metaphorical\u2014of our wardrobes. What do our clothes really mean to us? How attached are we to the things we own? This revolution in the way we relate to consumption has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives: Why have a car when you can call an Uber? Why own a bike when many cities allow you to grab one from a street stand?
