So it wasn\u2019t just walking in and changing whatever you want. It sounded good at first, but then there are some growing pains in that, too, because you\u2019ve got to get used to some plays not working and kind of looking ugly sometimes.\u201d", "In 2014, for instance, Alabama logged 6,783 yards of offense, then the highest total for a Saban-coached team.
