The Hollywood star, who turns 75 today, is still at the top of her fashion game after five decades in the spotlight. Since the beginning of her career in the 1970s, the actor has cultivated a timeless look that is completely unique to her\u2014and her style, full of tailoring and voluminous skirts, has only gotten better with age. If Keaton were a wine, she'd be a smooth, $500 bottle of Merlot.", "Her devotion to neutrals grounds her outfits: you\u2019ll rarely find her in anything other than black, white, beige, or gray. Though her color palette has stayed minimal, her classic look remains fresh thanks to her love of dramatic details. Her go-to pieces include extra-wide belts, high-waisted pants and full skirts, and of course, her dramatic chapeaus. (Back in September, she even stepped out in a baseball cap that spoke to the times: it read, \u201cVote bitches.\u201d) These days, Keaton will often wear experimental labels such as Thom Browne and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, favoring theatrical silhouettes that make up for her lack of color. It takes a special style skill to make an all-camel suit pop, but Keaton does it effortlessly, thanks to her interesting layering and proportioning.", "A look back at Keaton\u2019s red carpet style, however, shows that her innate eye for fashion has always been present and ahead of its time. Recently, Keaton revisited some of her favorite fashion moments from years past on Instagram, and shared that her love of style goes way back. \u201cEven when I was young, I was way into fashion,\u201d Keaton says in the video. \u201cMy mom and I used to pick out patterns, and then I\u2019d tell her what I wanted, and she\u2019d do it for me.\u201d In the early days of her acting career, Keaton always stuck to her own visions. In a sea of glitzy gowns, Keaton would rather stand out in a spiffy suit instead.", "At the 2004 Oscars, for instance, she showed up in a Ralph Lauren suit. The evening jacket had tails, and she accessorized it with wingtip shoes, a bowler hat, and even a tie, which nodded her character\u2019s iconic style in 1978\u2019s Annie Hall. The look went on to land her on many worst-dressed lists, but in our hearts, it\u2019s actually one of the best\u2014give it a golden trophy! Another winning look was in 1994 at a screening of Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight. Keaton showed up in a long, white evening coat with a high neckline, finished off with strands of pearl necklaces. The effect was cool rather than costumey.", "Feeling inspired by these inimitable outfit choices, Vogue is looking back at special Keaton looks that stand the test of time.
