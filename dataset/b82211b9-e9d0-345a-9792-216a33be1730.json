The ability to keep people connected and engaged", "\u201cTo keep employees connected and engaged, leaders have to inspire them,\u201d says Jim Link, CHRO at Randstad North America. But his company\u2019s research shows that this isn\u2019t happening. \u201cOnly 43% of employees strongly agree that their company has made the employee experience a priority; only 36% strongly agree that the overall digital vision has been communicated to them.\u201d", "And it may require a different type of leader to take the helm in this type of environment.", "\u201cCorporate America is full of leaders who can get the job done, but relationship-builders now rule the kingdom,\u201d according to Mark Babbitt, president and senior partner of WorqIQ, and co-author of \u201cA World Gone Social: How Companies Must Adapt to Survive.\u201d", "Leaders need to articulate the organisation\u2019s strategic vision, and develop both short-term and long-term goals, but they must also be able to express the vision and goals in a way that motivates employees. This extends to the digital vision, the pace at which new digital tools are implemented and how these tools can reduce redundant and repetitive tasks.", "\u201cIt is those leaders fully engaged in industry-related and innovation conversations most capable of pulling in the best people to co-create and execute high-profile projects,\u201d Babbitt explains.", "S. Chris Edmonds, founder of The Purposeful Culture Group, and author of \u201cThe Culture Engine: A Framework for Driving Results, Inspiring Your Employees, and Transforming Your Workplace,\u201d recommends that companies find a reliable way to measure employee engagement. Edmonds does not recommend using an in-house survey because it might not produce valid, reliable measures.", "\u201cGallup\u2019s Q12 questions can help companies get a true reading of connectedness and engagement,\u201d he says. \u201cConduct a connectedness and engagement survey at least twice a year to ensure you\u2019re getting accurate perceptions from team members and team leaders.\u201d", "Edmonds also recommends sharing the data with employees at all levels so they know the current \u201coperating reality,\u201d as well as plans to close the gaps.", "2. The ability to be more agile and digitally savvy", "According to the survey, 94% of employees say technological innovations are influencing what is required for a leader to be successful. But 27% of them believe their employers are three to five years behind the curve. And while 45% consider their employers competent at keeping up, they don\u2019t consider them digital or innovation leaders.", "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that, with younger sets of employees, the ability to utilise technology as a leader in engaging people and helping them do their work and understand the bigger business picture is important,\u201d Link explains.", "Digitally-savvy leaders use data and employ new technologies when making decisions, and they align technology to business strategy.", "\u201cThey leverage automation, intelligence, internal effectiveness and competitive advantage,\u201d Link says.", "From using cognitive technology in talent acquisition to using people analytics to improve employee engagement and retention, agile and digital-savvy leaders can effectively adapt to changes driven by digital technologies.", "In fact, Babbitt says digital savviness was listed as one of the top five leadership traits in his 2014 book, \u201cA World Gone Social,\u201d and five years later, he\u2019s seeing the effects for leaders who have not adapted.", "\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing leaders being selected over other well-qualified candidates exclusively due to two still relatively unique traits: 1) Their perceived level of digital savviness, and 2) The agility that seems to come with the informal education gained by being perpetually engaged.\u201d", "3. The ability to drive a culture of innovation, learning and continuous improvement", "The Randstad survey also reveals that innovative leaders are more likely to demonstrate curiosity, lead courageously, seize opportunities and maintain strategic business perspectives.", "\u201cIt\u2019s up to the leaders to establish a culture of innovation, learning and continuous improvement,\u201d Link says. \u201cExecutives who are able to stimulate creativity and create an environment that fosters experimentation will be more likely to drive innovation,\u201d he explains.", "And this trait may very well be the difference between success and failure.", "\u201cIn our increasingly competitive marketplace, one with disruptors ready to pounce on every stale company and vulnerable industry, innovation is critical to continued relevance,\u201d Babbitt says. \u201cToday\u2019s best leaders encourage entire teams to understand their role as not just innovators, but instigators.\u201d", "Analysing which aspects of an employee\u2019s job can be replaced by automation is only part of the equation. It\u2019s also necessary to re-train employees to use cognitive tools and realign their skills to work effectively and efficiently with artificial intelligence and robots while maximising their human skills.", "Companies must create a culture in which employees can not only embrace technology, but also feel empowered to think differently, speak out and share their views.", "\u201cIf you have a work culture where leaders and team members demean, dismiss and discount others\u2019 ideas, efforts and accomplishments, you\u2019ll never get to a place of innovation, learning and continuous improvement,\u201d Edmonds warns.", "If employees don\u2019t feel valued, he says they won\u2019t be proactive in solving problems and they\u2019ll never test out new solutions out of fear of being reprimanded or even fired.", "\u201cDefine your desired work culture and define how you\u2019ll make values (how people treat each other at work) as important as results, every day.\u201d", "4. The ability to be adept at risk-taking", "\u201cPeople who are viewed as innovative score 25% higher in risk management,\u201d Link says.", "Digital leadership leaves little room for fear of failure. The survey reveals that innovative leaders score lower in maintaining order and accuracy, but that\u2019s to be expected in risk-takers.", "\u201cThe best leaders\u2014rather than focus on number-crunching, conformity and compliance\u2014are, in general, more entrepreneurial in nature; more specifically, they are willing to take well-considered risks,\u201d Babbitt says. \u201cLeaders who are risk-takers, especially those willing to learn and quickly move on from the inevitable failures, typically drive outcomes that result in organisational growth and progress.\u201d", "Browse leadership courses for executives", "--", "Terri Williams is a freelance writer who covers leadership topics for The Economist Careers Network."], "pubDate": null}
