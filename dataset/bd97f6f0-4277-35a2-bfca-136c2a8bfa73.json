If she and her husband, a mathematician, hadn\u2019t reviewed videos of their other daughter at the same age, they might not have been as worried. Finally, when her younger daughter was eighteen months old, Dehgan shared her concerns with her pediatrician. \u201cI came in saying, \u2018I think there are issues,\u2019 and they said, \u2018O.K., we\u2019ll get her tested.\u2019 \u201d A New York State agency performed tests for learning disability, autism, cognitive issues, and speech delay. The testers concluded that Dehgan\u2019s toddler was learning disabled and that she was far behind other children in her age cohort, with a developmental age somewhere around six months. The Dehgans had her retested by a third party, a private clinic in Tribeca. \u201cThey told us that she was autistic and that she needed immediate intervention.\u201d Dehgan adjusted her work schedule in order to devote herself to accommodating her daughter\u2019s needs. \u201cI was sad to hear the diagnosis, but I was glad that we\u2019d caught it early, because early intervention is the key with developmental issues,\u201d she told me. \u201cI started researching schools in Boston, because I had heard that that was the best place. And we took her to intense therapy.\u201d Because Dehgan was preoccupied with those activities, she was several months late in taking her daughter back to her pediatrician for her two-year checkup. \u201cWhen I finally did, they gave her a hearing test\u2014which she failed,\u201d Dehgan continued. The cause of her developmental delays wasn\u2019t autism; it was conductive hearing loss. \u201cThe pediatrician hadn\u2019t thought to give her a hearing test when I brought her in initially. And neither the state nor the third party had tested her hearing, either.\u201d All newborns in New York State are supposed to be given a hearing test immediately after birth. Dehgan\u2019s daughter had passed hers, and, presumably for that reason, no one, including her parents and the Department of Health, had thought of deafness as a possible diagnosis. \u201cI consider myself an involved and somewhat educated parent, and so is my husband\u2014yet we both missed it,\u201d Dehgan said. \u201cAnd I even had a younger brother with hearing loss. Which gives me pause.\u201d The pediatrician\u2019s failure to consider hearing loss as an explanation is harder to understand, because the child had had ear problems almost since birth. \u201cHer ear canals are oddly shaped, it turns out, and she had so many ear infections when she was a baby that her eardrums would rupture, and gunk you don\u2019t need to know about was coming out,\u201d Dehgan said. Her daughter\u2019s problem was a form of conductive hearing loss, so called because it occurs when an obstruction or physical deformity prevents sound from being conducted all the way to the inner ear. Scar tissue from repeated severe infections had hardened her eardrums and filled her ear canals, so that virtually no vibrations were reaching her (undamaged) cochlea. Luckily, hearing loss of this type is almost always treatable. A surgeon operated on the child several times, to remove scar tissue and other blockages, and inserted tubes through her eardrums to drain her middle ears. \u201cRight now, she doesn\u2019t have perfect hearing, but she is managing without hearing aids,\u201d Dehgan said. \u201cShe\u2019s a social, happy kid, and you wouldn\u2019t guess that there was a problem. Once sound was allowed into her ears, she was able to make up for lost time, because we really worked with her. And it was caught early, so she was one of the lucky ones.\u201d Her hearing is affected by colds and ear infections, but her teachers learned to move her to the front of the classroom and make other accommodations. Dehgan\u2019s brother was less fortunate. \u201cHis hearing problem was detected when he was a child, but not a young child,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had made it through elementary school with limited hearing and kind of just overcompensated. He stuck to sports and places where he was comfortable, and then once his hearing loss had been diagnosed my mom made sure that he would at least leave home with his hearing aids.\u201d She said that there could possibly be a genetic connection between her brother\u2019s problem and her daughter\u2019s, but that they hadn\u2019t been tested for that.", "Thomas Edison, famously, became increasingly deaf, beginning in childhood. He attributed his deficit to an incident that occurred when he was twelve and working on a train. He said that the train\u2019s baggage master, to punish him for accidentally starting a fire with some chemistry equipment, \u201cboxed my ears so severely that I got somewhat deaf thereafter.\u201d Later in his life, Edison told a different version of the train story, in which the problem began when a conductor grabbed him by the ears to pull him into a moving boxcar. \u201cI felt something snap inside my head, and my deafness started from that time and has ever since progressed,\u201d he wrote. Both of those incidents made a huge impression on me, more than fifty years ago, when I watched Mickey Rooney re\u00ebnact them in the movie \u201cYoung Tom Edison.\u201d It\u2019s not certain that either one really occurred\u2014or, if they did, that they contributed to Edison\u2019s difficulties. His deafness most likely had a genetic origin. The near consensus nowadays is that the Edison\u2019s hearing problems were primarily conductive, and that the likely principal cause was either otosclerosis, which impedes the movement of the tiny bones in the middle ear, or mastoiditis, a bacterial infection of the mastoid bone, a part of the skull. Mastoiditis is typically caused by severe middle-ear infections that spread beyond the middle ear; in some cases, it can harm the auditory system and even spread to the brain, causing meningitis. The damage to Edison\u2019s hearing may have been aggravated by scarlet fever. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a bird sing since I was twelve years old,\u201d he wrote in 1885. Edison didn\u2019t always view his loss as a loss. \u201cThroughout his life Edison would claim that his poor hearing was an advantage; that it reduced distractions by enabling him to concentrate,\u201d Paul Israel, the director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers, at Rutgers, wrote, in \u201cEdison: A Life of Invention,\u201d published in 1998. Edison heard reasonably well when he was a young man; later, he said, his deafness allowed him to ignore \u201cthe babble of ordinary conversation.\u201d When his loss had become severe and he needed to hear something\u2014as he did when he auditioned musicians for early phonograph recordings\u2014he bit down on a wooden sound board attached to the phonograph. Some of the vibrations passed through the wood, through his jaw, through his temporal bone, and into his cochlea, bypassing his eardrum and middle ear. This form of sound transmission is known as bone conduction. People with normal hearing rely on it, too; it\u2019s part of the way we hear our own voices. (Bone conduction makes us think our voices are lower in pitch and more resonant than they sound to others, and that\u2019s the main reason we cringe the first time we hear ourselves speak on a recording.) Bone-conduction devices work only when the inner ear has at least some function. There are bone-conduction hearing aids, intended mainly for people whose principal hearing defects are in their middle ears or external ear canals; the most effective ones are physically anchored to the skull. There are also bone-conduction headphones for people who have normal hearing but want be able to (for example) listen to music or communicate with other people without interfering with their ability to hear ambient sounds. The Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden, in 2011, spoke to each other during the raid with \u201cbone phones,\u201d which left their ears uncovered. There are also versions intended for runners, who need to be able to hear cars approaching from behind, and scuba divers. A man who was recently accused of cheating at the poker game Texas hold \u2019em was thought to have a bone phone concealed in his hat. Edison sometimes argued that his form of deafness had made his inner ears more sensitive than other people\u2019s, by protecting them from \u201cthe millions of noises that dim the hearing of ears that hear everything.\u201d Still, he spent several months trying to invent a hearing aid, believing that the market would be huge. Israel quotes a longtime private secretary\u2019s recollection that Edison \u201cfelt the loss of his hearing very much when he had visitors, and if they told funny stories among themselves and laughed hilariously, a wistful look came over his face, for he was very fond of humorous stories.\u201d If, as a child, he\u2019d had access to modern interventions for the type of hearing loss he probably had, he likely would have been able to hear them."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/what-new-york-city-misses-by-not-doing-hearing-tests-on-students", "id": "bd97f6f0-4277-35a2-bfca-136c2a8bfa73", "title": "What New York City Misses by Not Doing Hearing Tests on Students", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "authors": ["David Owen", "Peter Schjeldahl", "Dexter Filkins", "Adam Entous", "Jia Tolentino"], "summary": "The cause of her developmental delays wasn\u2019t autism; it was conductive hearing loss.\n\u201cAnd I even had a younger brother with hearing loss.\nWhich gives me pause.\u201d The pediatrician\u2019s failure to consider hearing loss as an explanation is harder to understand, because the child had had ear problems almost since birth.\nLuckily, hearing loss of this type is almost always treatable.\n\u201cRight now, she doesn\u2019t have perfect hearing, but she is managing without hearing aids,\u201d Dehgan said.", "pubDate": null}
