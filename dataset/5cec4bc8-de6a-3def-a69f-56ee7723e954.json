The majority of what was published was about the claimant\u2019s own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father\u2019s behaviour \u2013 as she saw it \u2013 and the resulting rift between them. These are inherently private and personal matters.", "\u201cThe claimant had a reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private. The articles interfered with that reasonable expectation.\u201d", "Warby also found that the publication of the letter to Markle \u2013 which he described as \u201ca long-form telling-off\u201d \u2013 also infringed the duchess\u2019s copyright.", "In a statement, Meghan said: \u201cAfter two long years of pursuing litigation, I am grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers and the Mail on Sunday to account for their illegal and dehumanising practices.", "\u201cThese tactics \u2013 and those of their sister publications Mail Online and the Daily Mail \u2013 are not new \u2026 For these outlets, it\u2019s a game. For me and so many others, it\u2019s real life, real relationships and very real sadness. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.", "\u201cThe world needs reliable, fact-checked, high-quality news. What the Mail on Sunday and its partner publications do is the opposite. We all lose when misinformation sells more than truth, when moral exploitation sells more than decency, and when companies create their business model to profit from people\u2019s pain.", "\u201cBut, for today, with this comprehensive win on both privacy and copyright, we have all won.\u201d", "A spokesperson for Associated Newspapers said: \u201cWe are very surprised by today\u2019s summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial. We are carefully considering the judgment\u2019s contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.\u201d", "The judge said \u201cthe only tenable justification\u201d for publication would be to correct some inaccuracies about the letter contained in an article in People magazine that had featured an interview with friends of Meghan.", "It was legitimate for Markle and the defendant to use a part of the letter to rebut a false suggestion in the People article that the letter represented some form of \u201colive branch\u201d from the duchess to her father, he said. But it was the \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d that it was neither \u201cnecessary or proportionate\u201d to disclose the rest of the information in the letter, he added.", "\u201cTaken as a whole, the disclosures were manifestly excessive and hence unlawful,\u201d he said.", "On the copyright claim, Warby said an electronic draft of the letter \u201cwould inevitably be held to be the product of intellectual creativity sufficient to render it original in the relevant sense and to confer copyright on its author or authors\u201d.", "He also found that the MoS\u2019s articles \u201ccopied a large and important proportion of the work\u2019s original literary content\u201d.", "The issue of whether Meghan was \u201cthe sole author\u201d, or whether Jason Knauf, formerly communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a \u201cco-author\u201d, should be determined at a trial, despite being something \u201cof minor significance in the overall context\u201d, the judge said.", "Meghan\u2019s lawyer had argued for summary judgment without trial in her favour, claiming that Associated Newspapers had \u201cno prospect\u201d of defending her claims for misuse of private information and alleged breach of copyright. They argued that her case was so strong, a trial was unnecessary on those parts of her claim.", "Warby said there would be a further hearing in March to decide the next steps in the legal action. Meghan\u2019s data protection claim is still outstanding.", "The duchess sued Associated Newspapers in September 2019 over five articles in the MoS and Mail Online that were billed as a \u201cworld exclusive\u201d featuring \u201cMeghan\u2019s shattering letter to her father\u201d.", "A double-page spread in the MoS carried the headline: \u201cRevealed: the letter showing true tragedy of Meghan\u2019s rift with a father she says has \u2018broken her heart into a million pieces\u2019.\u201d", "The duchess is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement, and breach of the Data Protection Act over the five articles."], "authors": ["Caroline Davies"], "keywords": ["duchess", "wins", "mail", "private", "articles", "associated", "meghan", "letter", "meghans", "trial", "newspapers", "copyright", "case", "privacy"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
