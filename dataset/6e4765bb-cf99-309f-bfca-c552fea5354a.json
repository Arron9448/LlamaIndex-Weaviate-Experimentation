It'll be lengthy, for a start, with characters into the double figures. It should also include combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters\u2014having a password with multiple types of character makes it more difficult to crack.", "As for duplicate passwords, they may be easier for you to remember, but it means that if a password for one account becomes compromised, hackers can run through numerous other accounts of yours as well.", "Then there are the passwords that have been exposed publicly, appearing in data breaches. If this has happened to one of your passwords, it's likely that someone's going to be trying to force access sooner rather than later.

Chrome shows a list of all the issues it's found, split into categories, which can run into the hundreds if you've got a lot of accounts set up.", "To try and help out, Google provides links, where it can, to pages and apps where you can make changes to your login credentials. You can even use Chrome's password suggestions, if you want; you won't have to remember these weird combinations of characters, because Google remembers them for you.", "If you're don't see password suggestions in Chrome when you create new accounts or try to change your passwords, make sure you're running the latest version.
