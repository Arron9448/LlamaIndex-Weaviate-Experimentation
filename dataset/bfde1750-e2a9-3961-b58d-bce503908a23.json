Balancing style, affordability, and a hearty touch of nostalgia, Beverly\u2019s is an offbeat take on the classic general store\u2014and the brainchild of stylist Beverly Nguyen, whose decade-long career began between editorial and e-commerce, before her most recent stint as studio director for stylist to the stars Kate Young.
