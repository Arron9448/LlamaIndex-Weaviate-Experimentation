Trump would run again and lose because it could incite a similar riot. President Trump spent months inflaming his supporters, spread lies to incite a violent attack on our Capitol, on our law enforcement and on all of us. And then he lied again to his base to tell them that this was all OK, that this was all acceptable. And that is why President Trump is so dangerous because he would have all of us, all Americans, believe that any president who comes after him can do exactly the same thing. That\u2019s why lack of remorse is an important factor in impeachment because impeachment, conviction and disqualification is not just about the past, it\u2019s about the future. It\u2019s making sure that no future official, no future president does the same exact thing President Trump does. President Trump\u2019s lack of remorse shows that he will undoubtedly cause future harm if allowed because he still refuses to account for his previous high, grave crime against our government. You know, I\u2019m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to run again and lose because he can do this again. On Thursday, impeachment manager Representative Ted Lieu explained that his biggest fear was that former President Donald J. Trump would run again and lose because it could incite a similar riot. Credit Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times The House Democrats prosecuting Donald J. Trump resumed their case against him on Thursday, turning to the words of rioters who said they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 at his behest and warning that the former president\u2019s \u201clack of remorse\u201d suggested he would stoke fresh violence if not barred from holding office again. A day after delivering the Senate a harrowing account of the deadly violence, replete with chilling previously unseen security footage, the impeachment managers began displaying new video clips, court documents and media interviews in which the rioters defended their actions by citing Mr. Trump\u2019s directives and desires. \u201cWe were invited here,\u201d one of them screamed, the clip echoing through the Senate chamber. \u201cTheir own statements before, during and after the attack made clear the attack was done for Donald Trump \u2014 at his instructions and to fulfill his wishes,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, one of the nine House managers. Making concluding arguments, the prosecutors sharpened their case for making Mr. Trump the first impeached president ever convicted, and the first ex-president disqualified from holding future office. They argued he had encouraged and celebrated violence before Jan. 6 \u2014 from a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 to his campaign rallies \u2014 and shown no remorse for whipping up thousands of his loyal supporters by telling them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d that day. Afterward, they noted, Mr. Trump called his speech \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years,\u201d said Representative Ted Lieu of California, another manager. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to run again and lose, because he can do this again.\u201d Live Impeachment Stream: Senate Trial Analysis Join New York Times reporters for live coverage of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s second Senate impeachment trial. The proceeding began Tuesday with a debate about the constitutionality the impeachment trial and Wednesday with part of the prosecution\u2019s case against the former president. Their task is a daunting one, aimed at persuading Republican senators who have shown no appetite for breaking with Mr. Trump to do so, and building a historical record of his role in the worst attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. By turn, the managers sought to appeal to Republicans\u2019 sense of patriotism and common sense. They read them the words of fellow Republicans who voted in the House to impeach Mr. Trump and from the former president\u2019s own cabinet secretaries \u2014 including Elaine Chao, the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and the Transportation secretary \u2014 who resigned in protest after the deadly riot. They played audio of traumatized congressional aides who had contemplated leaving government after the attack. And they recounted the humiliating taunts of foreign adversaries who looked on in glee as the United States was embarrassed before the world. \u201cMy dear colleagues, is there any political leader in this room who believes if he\u2019s ever allowed by the Senate to get back into the Oval Office, Donald Trump would stop inciting violence to get his way?\u201d Mr. Raskin asked. \u201cWould you bet the lives of more police officers on that?

Trump\u2019s incitement and support of violence among his supporters leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Jan. 6 was a culmination of the president\u2019s actions, not an aberration from them. The insurrection was the most violent and dangerous episode, so far, in Donald Trump\u2019s continuing pattern and practice of inciting violence. The president praised a Republican candidate who assaulted a journalist, as \u2018my kind of guy.\u2019 He said there were, quote, \u2018very fine people on both sides\u2019 when the neo-Nazis, the Klansmen and Proud Boys invaded the city, the great city, of Charlottesville, and killed Heather Heyer. And he said that an attack on a Black protester at one of his rallies was \u2018very, very appropriate.\u2019 When responding to extremist plots in Michigan, Trump showed he knew how to use the power of a mob to advance his political objectives. Beginning in March, Trump leveled attacks on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for the coronavirus policies in her state. On Oct. 8, the precise consequences of the president\u2019s incitement to violence were revealed to the whole world. Look at this, 13 men were arrested by the F.B.I. for plotting to storm the Michigan State Capitol building, launch a civil war, kidnap Governor Whitmer, transport her to Wisconsin and then try and execute her. And what did Donald Trump do do as president of the United States to defend one of our nation\u2019s governors against a plotted kidnapping by violent insurrectionists? Did he publicly condemn violent domestic extremists who hoped and planned to launch a civil war in America? No, not at all. He further inflamed them by continuing to attack the governor who was the object of their hatred. My dear colleagues, is there any political leader in this room who believes that if he is ever allowed by the Senate to get back into the Oval Office, Donald Trump would stop inciting violence to get his way? Would you bet the lives of more police officers on that? Would you bet the safety of your family on that? Would you bet the future of your democracy on that? President Trump declared his conduct totally appropriate. So he gets back into office, and it happens again, we\u2019ll have no one to blame but ourselves. Representative Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, outlined a history of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s incitement and support of violence among his supporters leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Credit Credit...

Seventeen Republicans would have to join every Democrat to achieve the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are expected to present his defense beginning on Friday. They intend to deny that Mr. Trump was responsible for the attack or meant to interfere with the electoral process underway at the Capitol, despite his repeated exhortations to supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d One of the lawyers, David I. Schoen, derided the Democrats\u2019 presentation as a thinly sourced \u201centertainment package\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d during an appearance on Fox News while the trial was underway on Thursday. \u201cIn no setting in this country where someone\u2019s guilt or innocence is being adjudicated would this kind of approach be permitted,\u201d he said. The trial is moving at a galloping pace, and senators could reach a verdict by the end of the holiday weekend. But first, senators will have a chance to question the prosecution and defense, and the managers may force a debate and vote on calling witnesses.

Trump against the former president on Thursday, as they sought to show that the sacking of the Capitol was done by people who believed they were following Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes. \u201cThey truly believed that the whole intrusion was at the president\u2019s orders \u2014 and we know that because they said so,\u201d said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, and one of the House managers. In one clip, she showed rioters chanting \u201cStop the steal! Stop the steal!\u201d as they tried to enter the Capitol \u2014 not long after Mr. Trump had led that chant at a rally. In another, she showed a rioter, identified as Baked Alaska, the nickname of far-right personality Anthime J. Gionet, talking about calling up Mr. Trump while in the Capitol: \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy. What do you mean?

Oliver Contreras for The New York Times President Biden said Thursday that \u201csome minds may be changed\u201d by Democratic House prosecutors at the impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump, but that comment, made off-the-cuff in a meeting with reporters, seemed to go against his administration\u2019s strategy of willfully ignoring the proceedings. Just hours later, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said she believed Mr. Biden had actually said \u201cminds may be changed, or they may not.\u201d She described his remarks as a \u201chuman\u201d reaction to watching \u201charrowing\u201d trial footage that should not be confused for political analysis. But she dodged questions on whether the president had an obligation to opine on the possibility of a conviction of his predecessor. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the jury, he\u2019s not in the Senate,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. \u201cHis role is to be the President of the United States and that is the role he currently plays.\u201d Mr. Biden and his advisers have insisted for days that he is not paying close attention to the Senate trial of Mr. Trump. The president on Thursday hosted lawmakers for a discussion about infrastructure \u2014 and addressed the impeachment footage \u2014 and planned to tour a laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. At the beginning of the infrastructure meeting, he said that he had not watched any of the trial live on Wednesday, but that he had seen news reports. \u201cI\u2019m focused on my job,\u201d the president said, adding that he watched news reports of the trial later Wednesday night because he was \u201cgoing straight through last night until a little after nine.\u201d The new president and his team are determined to deliver the message that he is focused on the economic plight of the country, the pandemic that is still killing about 3,000 people each day and efforts to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s legacy. On Thursday morning, the White House confirmed that the president had canceled the national emergency at the southwest border that Mr. Trump had declared in order to divert money for construction of his border wall. In a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi dated Wednesday, Mr. Biden dismissed the emergency as an attempt by his predecessor to get around congressional refusal to provide funds for the wall\u2019s construction. \u201cI have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border was unwarranted,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have also announced that it shall be the policy of my administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall, and that I am directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to that end.\u201d Mr. Biden began his day convening a meeting in the Oval Office with senators from both parties in what the White House described as a discussion about \u201cthe critical need to invest in modern and sustainable American infrastructure.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, who was confirmed as Mr. Biden\u2019s transportation secretary last week, joined the meeting via video conference. \u201cI found these guys wandering around,\u201d Mr. Biden joked, motioning to the senators as reporters were let in for a few minutes at the beginning of the meeting. Mr. Biden cited the importance of the public works committee led by Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, in dealing with infrastructure issues. He said there are \u201ca number of things out there that the American people are looking for us to step up,\u201d and he mentioned \u201ca lot of bridges in West Virginia\u201d and \u201ca lot of dangerous spots on Route 9 in terms of Cancer Alley.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we have to do,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden said throughout the campaign that he supports a vast effort to rebuild the country\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges, tunnels and other critical infrastructure, in part as a way to help put Americans back to work. Many Republicans have said for years that they, too, support new investments in infrastructure, though an agreement on the size and scope of legislation has been elusive. While the White House has prioritized the passage of the president\u2019s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, Mr. Biden has signaled that he plans to push for more spending after that is approved. The strategy is part of his effort to \u201cbuild back better,\u201d a slogan he used during his presidential campaign.

Mr. Raskin\u2019s message was ostensibly for parents watching at home. But the subtext was not lost on those in the Senate chamber, where House managers who were victims of the attack were speaking to senators who themselves had survived the violent assault. Around them were their staffs who had cowered behind office desks as the mob rampaged through the building. Above them in the balcony, scribbling in notepads, were journalists who were equally traumatized and security officers who had been there to ward off the attackers. The humming rhythms of Capitol Hill do not easily allow for prolonged moments of reflection, let alone in the aftermath of an insurrection.

It was horrible, but it was also horribly necessary. In a brutal and deftly edited presentation, the managers presented the attack on the election\u2019s certification as a found-footage horror movie. Sometimes the horror was in seeing how awful and vicious the day was. Security and body camera footage showed police officers defending the building engaged in what could have been siege scenes from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 grisly, grunting, intimate violence.

We saw more of it in the days after. But we\u2019d never seen it so completely, so sweepingly. What the impeachment managers put together wasn\u2019t simply a deluge of shocking clips.

The daylong arguments also had dramatic structure, including cliffhanger-like act breaks as the trial went into recesses. But there was also a larger, serial arc that laid out, over the course of months, the charge that Mr. Trump had primed his followers to believe he could lose the election only if it were rigged; that he cheered on violence in his name; that he publicized the Jan. 6 rally and targeted politicians \u2014 including his own vice president \u2014 in a series of increasingly furious tweets. All of this was an effort to use the tools of television \u2014 imagery, emotion, montage \u2014 to build a case against a president who was made by and obsessed with TV.", "An Oath Keepers member texted \u2018If Trump asks me to come, I will,\u2019 ahead of Capitol attack, federal officials say.

Jim Bourg/Reuters Chilling new details emerged on Thursday in the plot by the Oath Keepers militia group to storm the Capitol as prosecutors said that an Ohio-based member of the organization was planning training sessions \u201cfor urban warfare, riot control and rescue operations\u201d as early as one week before Election Day. Shortly after the election, prosecutors said, the Oath Keeper member, Jessica Watkins, told an associate that she was \u201cawaiting direction from President Trump\u201d about what to do about the results of the vote. \u201cPOTUS has the right to activate units too,\u201d Ms. Watkins wrote in a text message to the unnamed associate on Nov. 9. \u201cIf Trump asks me to come, I will.\u201d The new accounts about Ms. Watkins \u2014 one of three Oath Keeper members charged with conspiracy in connection with the Capitol attack \u2014 were contained in a striking government memo that sought her detention before trial. In the memo, prosecutors said Ms. Watkins went to Washington on Jan. 6 with as many as 40 other members of the group, and that she and one of her co-defendants, Thomas E. Caldwell, had planned to stage \u201ca quick reaction force\u201d of more militiamen outside the city to serve as armed reinforcements. The federal authorities have now brought charges against more than 200 people in the attack on the Capitol last month, but the case against Ms. Watkins, Mr. Caldwell and their third co-defendant, Donovan Crowl, is one of the most serious to have so far emerged from the vast investigation. This week, Mr. Caldwell asked a judge to release him from custody, saying he was an injured Navy veteran with more than 30 years of experience with top secret matters. Ms. Watkins and Mr. Crowl are also still in jail and are likely to make similar requests to be released. The government memo filed on Thursday suggested that the investigation into the Oath Keepers, a group that largely draws its membership from former military and law enforcement personnel, has started to intensify. Prosecutors indicated that they now have access to Ms. Watkins\u2019 personal text messages, including some in which she described the prospect of Joseph R. Biden Jr. becoming president as \u201can existential threat.\u201d \u201cBiden may still be our president,\u201d she wrote on Nov. 17. \u201cIf he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights.\u201d By the end of December, prosecutors said, Ms. Watkins, a military veteran who owns a bar in rural Ohio, was making plans to go to Washington on the day of the attack on the Capitol. \u201cWe plan on going to DC on the 6th\u201d because \u201cTrump wants all able bodied Patriots to come,\u201d she wrote to Mr. Crowl on Dec. 29. \u201cIf Trump activates the Insurrection Act,\u201d she added, \u201cI\u2019d hate to miss it.\u201d", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "The graphic videos of the Capitol riot struck a chord with many G.O.P. senators, but they remain unlikely to convict Trump. Sen. Roy Blunt said Thursday he had not been swayed by the impeachment managers\u2019 case thus far. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times After watching graphic video on Wednesday from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, many Republican senators denounced the violence but said they were still inclined to acquit former President Donald J. Trump of the charge that he incited an insurrection. Speaking to reporters in the hallways of the Capitol, Republican senators made a variety of arguments in Mr. Trump\u2019s defense: that the matter should be decided by federal prosecutors, that the trial was unconstitutional since he is an ex-president, and that Mr. Trump\u2019s words to his supporters fell short of the legal standard for incitement. Some argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s language was no different from passionate statements coming from Democrats in opposing the former president. And one, Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, compared the rampage at the Capitol to protests for racial justice last year that turned violent, suggesting that the former president could not be held to account for the Jan. 6 riot any more than Democrats could for those events. \u201cI mean, you have a summer where people all over the country were doing similar kinds of things,\u201d said Mr. Blunt, the fourth-ranking Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the other side will show from Seattle and Portland and other places.\u201d He added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see a case a prosecutor could make against the president.\u201d (The standard for conviction in impeachment is different than in a criminal trial; prosecutors must prove the official committed treason, bribery or \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 typically understood as the use of power to threaten the constitutional order \u2014 not necessarily that he broke a law.) Forty-four Republican senators \u2014 all but six in the Senate \u2014 voted on Tuesday against moving forward with the trial, arguing that it is unconstitutional since Mr. Trump is no longer in office. Seventeen Republicans would have to join every Democrat to achieve the two-thirds threshold for an impeachment conviction. Asked if anything had changed after he viewed the video on Wednesday, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said he believed House managers would \u201cat best\u201d get six Republicans to vote for conviction. \u201cProbably five, but maybe six,\u201d Mr. Scott said. The six Republican senators who voted to move forward with the trial were: Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, said he wished Mr. Trump had \u201cused different language,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s constitutional\u201d for the Senate to try him. \u201cFor those of us that truly don\u2019t believe that we have that constitutional authority, that becomes a pretty big obstacle for them to overcome,\u201d he said. Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said the video made him \u201cangry,\u201d but that Mr. Trump had not been the only one using overheated political messaging. \u201cThere are a number of people around here that, I\u2019ve said before, have been placing tinder in that tinder box,\u201d Mr. Tillis said. \u201cAnd I think every one of them should reflect on their words and really think twice about what they should say.\u201d", "A majority of Republicans still view Biden\u2019s election as illegitimate, a poll finds. A Trump supporter demonstrating on Jan. 3 outside the Capitol. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times A majority of Republicans still view President Biden\u2019s election as illegitimate \u2014 and more than half would justify the use of force to defend \u201cthe traditional American way of life,\u201d according to a poll released on Day 3 of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Two-thirds of Republicans \u2014 66 percent \u2014 said Mr. Biden\u2019s election was not legitimate, compared with far smaller percentages of Democrats and independents who question the outcome, according to a survey taken during the last 10 days of January by the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think-tank that promotes conservative economic policies. Taken as a whole, two-thirds of Americans said Mr. Biden\u2019s win was legitimate, according to the poll. There was an educational divide embedded in the political divide: 75 percent of Republicans without college degrees still question the results, compared to 48 percent of those in the party identifying themselves as college educated. The most eye-opening finding, however, was the response to this sentence presented to respondents: \u201cThe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d While 60 percent of those surveyed rejected the idea outright, 55 percent of Republicans said they agreed with assertion \u2014 roughly three times the percentage of Democrats who expressed support for the use of force, according to the survey, which polled 2,016 U.S. adults. The report\u2019s authors added an important caveat: Support for the use of violence, even among those who said they would consider it, was unenthusiastic, with 9 percent of Americans over all and 13 percent of Republicans saying they \u201ccompletely\u201d agree with the necessity of taking violent actions if leaders fail. The poll also showed that many Republicans now entertain false claims promoted by the far right of the party, with half claiming that left-wing antifa activists \u2014 and not Trump supporters \u2014 instigated the attack on the Capitol. The survey was conducted by the institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life. Interviews were conducted among a random sample of U.S. adults using a web-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. general population. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll comes at a moment of extraordinary stress for the Republican Party as it struggles to move forward following the loss of a deeply polarizing former president who maintains a tight grip on his party\u2019s conservative base. Last Friday, more than 100 anti-Trump Republicans \u2014 many of them well-known dissenters active on social media and the cable networks \u2014 participated in a Zoom call to discuss creating a breakaway party group to promote \u201cprincipled conservatism,\u201d a direct rebuke of Mr. Trump, according to one of the participants. Creation of the party, which would potentially run center-right candidates around the country, was reported earlier by Reuters. The American Enterprise Institute\u2019s poll offered the group a glimmer of hope: While nearly 80 percent of Republicans still support Mr. Trump, those surveyed said their loyalty lies more with the party than the former president, by a 63-to-37 percent margin.", "The meaning of incitement may differ in a court than in an impeachment trial. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 4:53 - 0:00 transcript Prosecution Argues Trump Incited Capitol Riot House impeachment managers argued that former President Donald Trump had convinced his supporters over months that the election was stolen, incited the Jan. 6 riots and refused to stop the mob. \u201cNow, I want to be very clear about what we will show you during the course of this trial. As my fellow managers present our case to you today, tonight, tomorrow, it\u2019ll be helpful to think about President Trump\u2019s incitement of insurrection in three distinct parts. The provocation, the attack and the harm. Let\u2019s start with the provocation. We will show during the course of this trial that this attack was provoked by the president, incited by the president. And as a result, it was predictable and it was foreseeable. And as you evaluate the facts that we present to you, it will become clear exactly where that mob came from.\u201d \u201cYou saw President Trump prime for months, his supporters to believe that if the election was lost, it only could have been so because it was rigged. But that took time. Just like to build a fire, it doesn\u2019t just start with the flames. Donald Trump for months and months assembled the tinder, the kindling threw on logs for fuel to have his supporters believe that the only way their victory would be lost was if it was stolen. So that way, President Trump was ready if he lost the election, to light the match. And on Nov. 7, after all the votes were counted, President Trump did lose by seven million votes. But for Donald Trump, all was not lost. He had a backup plan: Instead of accepting the results or pursuing legitimate claims, he told his base more lies. He doused the flames with kerosene.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll start by discussing President Trump\u2019s actions leading up to the election when he set up his big lie. Beginning in the spring of 2020, President Trump began to fall behind in the polls. And by July, President Trump had reached a new low. He was running 15 points behind his opponent. And he was scared. He began to believe that he could legitimately lose the election. And so he did something entirely unprecedented in the history of our nation. He refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s start with Dec. 12. You will see during this trial a man who praised and encouraged and cultivated violence. \u2018We have just begun to fight,\u2019 he says, more than a month after the election has taken place. On Dec. 19, 18 days before Jan. 6, he told his base about where the battle would be, that they would fight next: Jan. 6 would be wild, he promised. \u2018Be there, will be wild!\u2019 said the president of the United States of America. They were invited here by the president of the United States of America. And when they showed up, knowing of these reports that the crowd was angry and it was armed, here\u2019s what Donald Trump told them. \u2018If you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u2019 And then he aimed straight at the Capitol declaring, \u2018You\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\u2019 He told them to fight like hell, and they brought us hell.\u201d \u201cBy 2:15 P.M., the crowd was chanting in unison, \u2018Hang Mike Pence\u2019 outside the very building he had been evacuated from with his family. Now, even if President Trump didn\u2019t know that his inflammatory remarks about his vice president would result in chants of \u2018Hang Mike Pence,\u2019 by 2:15 P.M., he surely knew.\u201d \u201cEven when President Trump knew what his words were causing, he didn\u2019t do any of those things to stop the crowd.\u201d House impeachment managers argued that former President Donald Trump had convinced his supporters over months that the election was stolen, incited the Jan. 6 riots and refused to stop the mob. Credit Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times When Donald J. Trump was running for president in 2016, he pointed to some protesters at one of his rallies and told the crowd to \u201cget \u2019em out of here.\u201d The protesters, who said they were then viciously assaulted, sued him for inciting a riot. Mr. Trump won the suit. A federal appeals court, relying on a case concerning the Ku Klux Klan, ruled that his exhortation was protected by the First Amendment. And now his lawyers are making the same argument at his impeachment trial, where he stands accused of inciting an insurrection. But Democrats say that argument misses two key points. An impeachment trial, they contend, is concerned with abuses of official power, meaning that statements that may be legally defensible when uttered by a private individual can nonetheless be grounds for impeachment. Equally important, they say that Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on Jan. 6 should not be considered in isolation but as the final effort of a calculated, monthslong campaign to violate his oath of office in an effort to retain power. Stacey E. Plaskett, a Democratic delegate from the Virgin Islands and an impeachment manager, said Mr. Trump\u2019s statements were the culmination of a pattern of conduct that deliberately encouraged lawlessness. \u201cDonald Trump over many months cultivated violence, praised it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then when he saw the violence his supporters were capable of, he channeled it to his big, wild historic event.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s call to the crowd in 2016 had none of that baggage, but Judge David J. Hale of the Federal District Court in Louisville, Ky., allowed a lawsuit against him to proceed, writing that incitement is a capacious term. Quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, he wrote that it was defined as \u2018the act or an instance of provoking, urging on or stirring up,\u2019 or, in criminal law, \u2018the act of persuading another person to commit a crime.\u2019\u201d But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, reversed Judge Hale\u2019s decision, ruling that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio protected Mr. Trump. \u201cIn the ears of some supporters, Trump\u2019s words may have had a tendency to elicit a physical response, in the event a disruptive protester refused to leave,\u201d Judge David W. McKeague wrote for the majority, \u201cbut they did not specifically advocate such a response.\u201d It was significant, too, Judge McKeague wrote, that Mr. Trump had added a caveat to his exhortation, according to the lawsuit. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt \u2019em,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I say \u2018go get \u2019em,\u2019 I get in trouble with the press.\u201d Mr. Trump offered a similarly mixed message on Jan. 6. Even as he urged his supporters to \u201cgo to the Capitol\u201d and \u201cfight like hell,\u201d he also made at least one milder comment. \u201cI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\u201d he said. Ordinary courts might consider the speech in isolation and credit the occasional calmer passage. But the House managers are urging the Senate to hold a president to a different standard, one that takes account of the months of actions and statements leading to the speech and that holds him responsible for any call to violence or lawlessness.", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story"], "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "keywords": ["mr", "trump", "trumps", "attack", "fresh", "impeachment", "stoke", "trial", "prosecutors", "president", "capitol", "live", "house", "donald", "updates", "warn", "violence"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
