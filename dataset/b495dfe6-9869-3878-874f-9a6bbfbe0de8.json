So the concept is very old -- but [ancient pissa] was bread, sometimes fried and sometimes baked, possibly with condiments on it.\"", "The food popped up again -- this time as \"pizza\" -- in 997 CE.

Zancani -- who remembers eating pizza while a student in London as \"the cheapest way to survive\" -- says that the American innovation of freezing pizza dough in the 1950s was what took the food all over the world.
