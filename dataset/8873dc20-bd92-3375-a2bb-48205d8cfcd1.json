Being an ultra weekend warrior while working 80-hour weeks had caught up to her.", "\u201cI was burning out,\u201d she says. \u201cRacers would go home to sleep and recover and I\u2019d go home to hop on client calls.\u201d In 2015, she quit her job, moved into her Chevy Astro van and dedicated her days to trail running.", "Ms. Stroeer quit her job as a consultant to chase speed records up some of the world\u2019s tallest mountains. Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal", "Ms. Stroeer, 34, describes herself as a high-altitude endurance specialist or, in simpler terms, a mountain athlete. \u201cI was an OK ultra runner but a passionate high-altitude mountaineer, so I combined the two and now I tell people I try to go up mountains as fast as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the psychological challenge and sense of personal discovery. It\u2019s a physical test, but also a mental one to see how much adversity you can deal with.\u201d", "In 2017, Ms. Stroeer gained attention in the adventure world when she set the female speed record of eight hours and 47 minutes up Argentina\u2019s 22,841-foot Mount Aconcagua, South America\u2019s highest peak. She is part of a growing number of athletes who eschew race medals for the glory of setting their fastest known time, or FKT. Because it involves no sanctioned race, athletes announce their intended goal in advance so others can follow along and verify their claims via live GPS tracking.", "Ms. Stroeer jokes that mountain running is a very slow sport. \u201cThe running part is kind of a misnomer, as the majority of the time you\u2019re power hiking,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me nine hours to cover 1.5 miles.\u201d This summer she attempted and failed to set a speed record on Nolan\u2019s 14, a route over the 14 summits over 14,000 feet in Colorado\u2019s Sawatch Range.", "She\u2019s training for speedy summits of Denali in Alaska and Island Peak in Nepal and hopes to complete the Ultra Gobi, a nearly 250-mile, self-supported race in China next year that must be finished in under 149 hours. These days she and her husband make money leading mountain expeditions and move their van between Colorado, Utah and California so she can train. She hopes to land sponsorships that will allow her to continue her mountain pursuits.", "Ms. Stroeer says rock climbing builds core and leg strength, both crucial for steep mountain runs.

Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal", "The Workout", "When Ms. Stroeer lived in Houston, she would run 3 to 5 miles on the road during the week and do longer runs on weekends. To prepare for a high-altitude race, she would use a hyperbaric chamber and do treadmill and strength workouts at a simulated 12,000 feet to 17,000 feet up to five hours a week.", "Ms. Stroeer on Mount Aconcagua in Argentina in 2017, en route to setting the female speed record up South America's highest peak. Photo: Libby Sauter", "Now her workouts focus on three things: training at altitude, maximizing time on her feet and increasing the vertical distance she covers each week. If she has a record pursuit at 14,000 feet or higher, she moves her van to a location that allows her to sleep and train at altitude. For example, she spent much of this summer in Leadville, Colo., a town at 10,152 feet.", "Spending as much time as possible on the trails helps her develop lateral stability in her calves and ankle strength, she says. During a peak training week, she might spend over 30 hours on the trails, covering around 80 miles with 28,000 feet of vertical gain.", "Ms. Stroeer\u2019s husband, Paul Gagner, quit his job last year to travel with her. He hates running but joins her rock climbing twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s great for building core and leg strength, as well as improving flexibility and agility,\u201d she says. She also does a seven-exercise body-weight circuit three to four days a week. Exercises include planks, push-ups, crunches and Russian twists, where she balances in boat pose and twists from right to left.", "\u201cI always have tight hamstrings and calves, so pigeon pose and forward bends are daily rituals,\u201d she says. A lack of sleep was one reason she decided to quit her job. \u201cI was averaging four hours a night,\u201d she says. \u201cI now try to get 10 to 12 and nap when I\u2019m in peak training.\u201d", "Ms. Stroeer works on a climb called New Addiction. Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal", "The Diet", "In the run-up to a big-mountain mission, Ms. Stroeer eats as clean as possible. \u201cI double down on vegetables, salmon, avocados and cottage cheese and I cut out alcohol, caffeine and minimize processed foods and sugar, sometimes for as much as four months in advance,\u201d she says. \u201cI place great emphasis on weaning myself off caffeine so that my receptors are extra sensitive to caffeine stimulation when I get to a point in the run where I want that boost.\u201d", "At race aid stations she eats everything in sight, including ramen, quesadillas and grilled cheese. On unorganized runs she relies on energy-dense chews, waffles, gels and drinks. A two-burner stove serves as her van kitchen. \u201cDinner is pretty formulaic,\u201d she says. \u201cProtein, starch, veg.\u201d", "The Gear and Cost", "Ms. Stroeer swears by her Leki Micro Trail Pro trail running poles ($200). She prefers to wear an all-terrain mid-top boot made by Lowa rather than trail running shoes. Her running is slow and technical enough that she considers the shoes\u2019 extra weight a necessary trade-off for stability. \u201cI go faster knowing I can charge through ankle-breaking terrain in boots,\u201d she says. For big races, she carries a 12-pound pack with 2 liters of water, a headlamp, a puffy jacket, gloves, rain shell, iodine tablets to purify water and a bivvi bag.", "Ms. Stroeer embraced van life in 2015 so she could train in different mountain settings. Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal", "The Playlist", "\u201cWhen I have missions where I am alone in bear country and below tree line in the dark, I will often put a podcast on and play it on speaker to distract myself from worrying about bears and to make noise so that any bears in the vicinity hopefully hear me approaching and scatter before I run into them,\u201d she says.", "Trail Running for Mere Mortals", "Adopting trail running can feel like learning to run all over again, says Rich Airey, founder of Denver-based BlackSheep Endurance. Mentally, you need to accept that you\u2019re going to be slower, he says.", "\u201cIt helps to ditch the watch,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might run a seven-minute mile on the road and only a quarter-mile in that same time on trails.\u201d Walking during a race is considered sacrilege by many road runners, he says, but on trails, you can often hike uphill faster than you can run.", "Share Your Thoughts Would you consider running instead of hiking on a trail? Join the conversation below.", "Mr. Airey says it\u2019s also easy to overextend your stride running downhill. \u201cIdeally, you want to have your heel under your hip and keep your cadence at around 170 steps per minute, even on the downhills,\u201d he says.", "Strengthening the tendons around the ankle will help prevent sprains. Mr. Airey suggests using resistance bands to work ankle flexion and extension and doing calf raises off a step or curb. Samuel Adams, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Duke University Medical Center, also suggests doing exercises that work proprioception, or body awareness, such as squats or lunges performed on a BOSU ball.", "Dr. Adams says runners whose strides land on the outer edge of the foot tend to have a higher likelihood of rolling or spraining their ankles. \u201cA shoe that does not have a high arch can help with this,\u201d he says. He recommends an ankle brace for added stability.", "What\u2019s your workout?
