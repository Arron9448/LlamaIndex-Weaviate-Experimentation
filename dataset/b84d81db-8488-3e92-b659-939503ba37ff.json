It was 2014 and his band Years & Years had just signed to Polydor when he visited the shrink.", "\u201cI said: \u2018The album\u2019s coming out and I really want it to be successful,\u2019 and he said: \u2018What happens if it isn\u2019t?\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not an option because I have planned it in my diary since I was a teenager.\u2019\u201d", "That diary was less about chronicling the present than a series of promises he made to himself. \u201cI planned my life till I was 25. I would be a famous musician \u2019cos musicians were the coolest people in the world. The biggest thing in the list was buying my mum a house, and I did that. That was the coolest thing to be able to do with my money.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThat was the coolest thing ever.\u201d", "Now Alexander might well benefit from another visit to the shrink because he\u2019s about to become a lot more famous. He stars in It\u2019s a Sin, the brilliant new TV drama by Russell T Davies, about a group of young gay men living and dying through the Aids epidemic in the 1980s. The five-part series is funny, vibrant, sexy and heartbreaking.", "This is by no means the first time Alexander has acted \u2013 he has appeared in the TV series Skins, films such as Bright Star (about Keats), Gulliver\u2019s Travels and Great Expectations, and on stage in the West End alongside Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw in Peter and Alice; a pretty impressive CV. But with It\u2019s a Sin, he knows he has struck gold. \u201cSome actors would wait their entire careers and not get such a good role,\u201d Alexander says, and he\u2019s right. Davies has made a habit of creating groundbreaking TV series (Queer As Folk, Bob and Rose, Torchwood), and this is his best yet.", "Alexander\u2019s character, Ritchie Tozer, is an aspiring actor/singer who has just moved to London from the Isle of Wight in search of fame, fortune and a good shagging. He embraces his new freedoms with promiscuous abandon, while also struggling with his sexuality. Ritchie is equally cocky and vulnerable, lovable and insufferable.", "Although It\u2019s a Sin takes place in a time before Alexander was born, he says there are so many ways he relates to Ritchie\u2019s life. There is one crucial difference \u2013 whereas Ritchie is secretive, Alexander is an open book. If there\u2019s anything to tell you, he\u2019ll tell you, even if he is embarrassed a second later about his indiscretions. It\u2019s an endearing quality, and one that makes him great company.", "We meet in his agent\u2019s east London office in December, when Tier 4 restrictions are yet to kick in. Alexander is a boyish 30 \u2013 half punk, half catwalk model, with orange hair, earrings, multiple rings, stylish khaki trousers and a handful of inky tattoos. He is garrulous and giggly with a huge toothy grin.", "Like Ritchie, Alexander was a stranger to city life when he came to London. He was born in North Yorkshire, went to primary school in Blackpool and Gloucestershire, and a comprehensive in Monmouth, south Wales. He was a natural performer who wrote his first song at the age of 10. \u201cI performed it in my year six assembly.\u201d Can he remember it? He squirms. \u201cYeah!\u201d Let\u2019s hear it then? \u201cNo!\u201d Oh go on! \u201cOK, OK. \u2018The leaves are falling outside my window. I\u2019m lay here all alone,\u201d he sings quietly, in that delicate falsetto. He giggles, blushes and continues. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m a knowin\u2019, the way it\u2019s goin\u2019, we won\u2019t last for ever, for ever my love.\u2019\u201d", "Wow, those lyrics are pretty sophisticated \u2013 and melancholy. He giggles again. \u201cOh thanks. It\u2019s about unrequited love. Doomed love. I was getting in early on my themes. I had a bit of help from my dad.\u201d He wrote it after experiencing his first pangs \u2013 for a boy in his class.", "At secondary school Alexander was a victim of homophobic bullying. He responded with elan. \u201cI would still come to non-uniform day in eyeliner.\u201d Did he fight back? \u201cSometimes I would scream. I was not a good fighter. We did rugby a lot at my school \u2013 a Welsh school. The one time I scored a try, on the way back to the changing room the two popular boys from the year put their arms around me and said: \u2018Well done, Olly,\u201d and I was like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe it, this is it!\u2019\u201d He pauses long enough for me to get a glowing feeling. \u201cThen they tripped me up and pushed my face into the mud. That was hard to live down.\u201d After that he never went to another games lesson.", "When he was 13, his parents separated, and from then he was brought up by his mother, events organiser Vicki Thornton (his real surname \u2013 Alexander is his middle name). His father had been a talented but disappointed singer-songwriter who made a living marketing theme parks. Although he gave young Olly a lifelong passion for adventure rides, there were tensions between the two of them. After his parents split up, he broke off contact with his father. When Alexander became successful, his father tried to rekindle their relationship via Twitter. Alexander wasn\u2019t impressed.", "On stage with Years & Years. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock", "With the sod-you eyeliner and supreme belief that he would make it, he sounds incredibly robust. So what else was in that teenage diary? \u201cPppprrrr.\u201d He blows his lips as if feeling a sudden chill. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit dark. I used to write that I really wanted to be skinny.\u201d He exhales deeply. \u201cMy mantra was always: I\u2019m not going to eat this again, I\u2019m not going to eat cake again. I\u2019m never going to eat pasta.\u201d He was barely into his teens when he became bulimic and started to list the things he wouldn\u2019t eat. Actually, he says it was worse than that. \u201cI was writing down: don\u2019t eat, don\u2019t eat, don\u2019t eat. Did he have a weight problem? \u201cI was a little chubby at primary school, but no.\u201d What does he think it came from? \u201cIt was something I could control. I felt very out of control in the rest of my life. I was struggling with my sexuality, my parents were divorcing, and I wanted to punish myself.\u201d", "I want to give him a hug, but I\u2019m not sure he would appreciate it, particularly in the pandemic. Why did he want to punish himself? \u201cIt was self-loathing. I didn\u2019t want to be gay. I was convinced I was the reason my parents were splitting up.\u201d He never considered that their divorce may have had nothing to do with him.", "He started to cut himself, too. Has he still got the scars? He points to his upper arms and thighs, \u201cbecause people can\u2019t see there. I was deeply ashamed of doing it. I wanted to hide it.\u201d Are there many scars? \u201cNo. A friend saw a plaster on my arm and jokingly asked if I\u2019d been cutting myself. After that, I was so embarrassed that I mostly stopped doing it. Bulimia carried on well into my 2os, but it became less and less frequent. It\u2019s really hard to hold down any kind of job if you\u2019re throwing up food all the time, and ultimately you have to choose.\u201d It becomes a full-time occupation? \u201cYes, it\u2019s all you think about. And you\u2019re doing so much damage to your organs. I got taken into hospital once with my mum because I had this irregular heartbeat, which can happen through constant purging, and that really scared me. I thought I\u2019d done something irreparable to my body, and my mum was so distraught. She couldn\u2019t understand why her son was throwing up all the food she was trying to give him. She found out because I hadn\u2019t cleaned the toilet properly.\u201d", "After studying performing arts at Hereford College of Arts, he moved to London and was liberated. He had a heady time of it \u2013 more drugs, clubbing and sex than even he had hoped for, while also getting regular work as an actor. But there was a downside. He saw friends struggle, sacrifice themselves to excess, fall by the wayside. \u201cEverything was about going out and connecting with people at the clubs. I had a great time, but it was also a dark time. A lot of people took too many drugs. A few friends attempted to take their lives and one succeeded. That was devastating. You can see how easy it is for a party lifestyle to turn into something negative.\u201d", "With Jeremy Irvine in Great Expectations. Photograph: BBC Films/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock", "Alexander has a strong survival instinct. There was his destiny to fulfil, the house to buy for his mother. He still struggled with his mental health, so he cut down on the destructive stuff. Today, he says, his main drug of choice is the antidepressant sertraline. \u201cI was worried about longterm use, and the doctor said: \u2018Well, the latest research shows it can promote neurogenesis, and I was like that\u2019s the coolest thing ever.\u201d Neurogenesis is the process by which new neurons are formed in the brain. \u201cShe was basically saying antidepressants are giving you superpowers, and I was like: \u2018Amazing, I\u2019ll keep taking them for ever.\u2019\u201d He starts giggling, and he can\u2019t stop. \u201cNeurogenesis \u2013 ooh, I love that. I\u2019m going to be neuro-supercharged.\u201d", "Years & Years formed in 2010. Founder member and synth/bass/keyboard player Mikey Goldsworthy heard Alexander singing in the shower and asked if he wanted to become lead singer. When Alexander joined, Years & Years were a five-piece band, before shrinking to an electropop trio (Alexander, Goldsworthy and fellow guitarist and keyboard guru Emre T\u00fcrkmen). Alexander, the main songwriter, has an ear for great sweeping choruses (think Sam Smith meets Pet Shop Boys with a dash of New Order). Their first album, Communion, went to No 1 in the UK, while the song King topped the singles chart and its follow-up, Shine, reached No 2. Many of their songs are about yearning and doomed love \u2013 particularly on their second album, Palo Santo \u2013 just like the first one he wrote aged 10.", "Alexander also became known as an LGBTQ campaigner. He made a documentary, Growing Up Gay, for the BBC in which he talked to his mother in a tear-filled exchange about coming out; he also interviewed people about struggles with their sexuality, the pressure to be promiscuous and take drugs, and addressed schoolchildren about homophobia and mental health problems. Does he think of himself as an activist? He shakes his head. \u201cIt does a disservice to actual activists. There\u2019s a tendency to use that word for anyone in the public eye speaking up about any issue. Going into schools and talking about mental health isn\u2019t activism. I like doing that. If I can be helpful, I want to help.\u201d", "The week before we meet he was named celebrity of the year at the British LGBT awards. He doesn\u2019t know why \u2013 he says he didn\u2019t do anything in 2020. \u201cMaybe they heard about my upcoming role and got in there early!\u201d", "He says he has learned so much from making It\u2019s a Sin \u2013 not least about acting, and how tough it can be. \u201cDoing an acting job where you have to turn up every day is really challenging. I was so used to my musician lifestyle, which is usually: get up late, get in a car, get driven to an airport, get on a plane, fall asleep, arrive somewhere, get driven to the venue, roll out of the car and do the show. It was too much like hard work every day. I thought I\u2019d got past this!\u201d", "We see a lot of Alexander in It\u2019s a Sin \u2013 in every sense. He gets more than his share of sex scenes, and says it was fascinating being taught how to do them properly. So he enjoyed them? \u201cAll those hot guys. That aspect I loved! And going into it I thought, I\u2019m going to have so much fun doing this, I\u2019m a confident-ish guy, love having sex, it will be great.\u201d That\u2019s so refreshing, I say, to hear actors admit they enjoy sex scenes.", "In It\u2019s a Sin. Photograph: Ben Blackall/Channel 4 undefined", "Ah, well, he says, it wasn\u2019t quite that simple \u2013 he initially became self-conscious. \u201cI broke down into hysterical tears, like \u2018don\u2019t fucking touch me\u2019. I found it really hard.\u201d Then the intimacy coordinators got to work on him. \u201cThey were a life-changing experience. Intimacy coordinators are there for safety \u2019cos there\u2019s a lot of shit that can go wrong between what a director wants and what an actor wants, and boundaries being crossed. They\u2019re there to rehearse everything beforehand with the director and the performers. You talk about animals you might imitate, the sounds you make.\u201d He pays tribute to intimacy coordinator extraordinaire Ita O\u2019Brien, who introduced the Intimacy on Set guidelines in 2017 and worked on Normal People as well as It\u2019s a Sin. \u201cAnything with sex in it, she\u2019ll be involved. She\u2019ll be on all fours at one point, saying: \u2018Now I\u2019m going to be like a cow and moo in ecstasy.\u2019 She\u2019s amazing, amazing, amazing.\u201d And yes, he did start to enjoy the scenes.", "Did he find them arousing? Now it\u2019s my turn to blush and I apologise for the question. Did he start to enjoy it too much? \u201cNo, that\u2019s what I want to know. What if someone gets a hard-on \u2013 how embarrassing would that be? Ita said: \u2018It\u2019s natural and normal for certain body parts to get excited and if you get an erection that\u2019s absolutely fine, but it\u2019s not appropriate for the workplace.\u2019\u201d He adds a caveat: \u201cDepending on what kind of job you\u2019re doing. And she said: \u2018If that happens, you just take a time out. So you\u2019re all there thinking, OK, how embarrassing \u2013 because you say time out and everybody knows it\u2019s because you\u2019ve got a hard-on.

Great kisser.\u201d And the best shag? \u201cSexual simulation,\u201d he corrects me. \u201cBest sexual simulation was Roscoe [Omari Douglas, another relative newcomer].\u201d Has he told them? \u201cIt\u2019s all coming out in this article, Simon.\u201d And I can sense him calibrating what he has just said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to ruin my standing!\u201d But a second later he changes his mind. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a compliment right? I compliment them both. Hahahaha!\u201d And he laughs giddily.", "I ask about the future. You sense he\u2019s not sure where to go from here, acting-wise \u2013 that it can\u2019t get any better than It\u2019s a Sin. Fortunately, he owes the band an album\u2019s worth of songs. He had them done and dusted before the pandemic. \u201cBut all that time in my flat going insane made me realise I didn\u2019t like any of the music, it didn\u2019t feel relevant. I just wanted to start again, which is what I did. Now it\u2019s almost ready \u2013 again.\u201d", "It will be only their third album in seven years. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. Ariana Grande has had about five out in the time we\u2019ve done one.\u201d In the meantime, he says, T\u00fcrkmen has had one baby, with another on the way.", "What about his own love life? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dire.\u201d Sex? \u201cI\u2019m hopeful to have more sex \u2026 it\u2019s very difficult in the age of Covid if you\u2019re single. I actually tried to lock someone down who would be my \u2018friends with benefits\u2019 sex buddy, because I saw that Holland were advising people to do that. In the first lockdown I said: \u2018Look, we can just have sex with each other. I trust you, you trust me, we\u2019re not together, but this is an arrangement. I\u2019ve not had sex in six months, what do you think?\u2019 But he said no. I was quite upset. So yeah, not a lot of sex in 2020.\u201d For a split-second, the puckish Alexander looks forlorn. Then he grins his toothiest grin yet. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful that it will pick up in the new year!\u201d", "It\u2019s a Sin is on Channel 4 on 22 January at 9pm"], "authors": ["Simon Hattenstone"], "keywords": ["loved", "doing", "olly", "great", "success", "alexander", "sin", "sex", "thats", "going", "hot", "really", "eat", "im", "sanity", "guys"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
