One of the most heavily visited spaces in the nation\u2019s capital, the building has been closed for several months due to the pandemic but also to allow for a major renovation. The great hanging Calder was removed; the sculptures by Richard Serra, Isamu Noguchi, and Max Ernst stayed put but were enclosed in protective boxes the size of mobile homes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so deadly in there,\u201d Molly Donovan, the NGA\u2019s contemporary-art curator, remembers thinking when the process began. \u201cNo art, just gray construction walls. What can we do?\u201d Her solution: Get artists to transform the atrium while the work goes on. \u201cI was looking for color, and Sarah provides that like nobody else\u2014joyful, exuberant, remarkable paintings.\u201d", "From the start of her 15-plus-year career, Cain tells me on Skype, \u201cpeople always give me the weird spots that they don\u2019t know what to do with.\u201d I\u2019m on the East Coast, and she\u2019s in her Los Angeles studio, surrounded by eight-by-seven-foot canvases that will come together as one painting on a very large, temporary construction wall. \u201cI was really excited about the project. I thought, Okay, I\u2019ll go there and make a massive work on-site.\u201d Part of the fun would be supplanting the \u201cold dudes,\u201d the male 20th-century masters who have always occupied the atrium, and this thought contributed to the show\u2019s title: \u201cMy favorite season is the fall of the patriarchy.\u201d", "But then the pandemic hit. The NGA had planned to remain open during the renovation, but it was forced to shut in March of last year. As of this writing, it intends to reopen sometime this spring. Meanwhile, the actual creation of the installation faced new hurdles: Unable to travel, Cain had to figure out how to work from a distance and still keep the spontaneity of her intuitive improvisation. \u201cOne of my biggest goals is to make active, exciting, breathable work,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve made more than 50 works on-site, and I love the ephemerality and the present tense and the energy this can capture.\u201d The imagery (a giant purple-violet \u201cX,\u201d hot-pink and multicolored geometric abstractions, etc.) was eventually applied to the protective boxes by National Gallery design staff, who worked from Cain\u2019s detailed drawings and were overseen by FaceTime guidance. \u201cI\u2019m actually excited to be doing it this way,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big learning curve, but I\u2019ve come to realize that I don\u2019t have to be there. I can do this until I\u2019m 90.\u201d", "A detail of the working composite for Cain\u2019s National Gallery installation. Jeff McLane", "Cain lives in the Garvanza neighborhood of L.A., near Pasadena, and her studio is on the property, with a view of orange, lemon, and apricot trees. In this worst of all possible times, she is busier than ever. She gets up early to feed her rescue cats and works nonstop until it\u2019s time to feed the cats again and go to bed. \u201cI started doing cat rescue so I\u2019d stop dating assholes,\u201d she says with a big laugh. \u201cI have a really sweet boyfriend\u201d\u2014a marine biologist, whom she refers to as \u201cmy cutie\u201d\u2014\u201cand a lot of cats. I trap them, have them fixed at the vet, and then release them if they have a food source. I\u2019ve flown quite a few cats to the art world in New York.\u201d Cain, who keeps in shape with strenuous hill hiking and online Pilates, is planting an ambitious garden in her backyard and has organized her pandemic social life around FaceTime teas with friends.", "Her exhibition \u201cIn Nature\u201d opened this month at the Momentary, the new contemporary art satellite of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, and her \u201cEnter the Center\u201d show is scheduled for July at the Tang Teaching Museum at Skidmore College. She recently joined Broadway, a new gallery in downtown Manhattan, where she\u2019ll have a solo show in September. \u201cI\u2019m insanely overscheduled,\u201d she tells me. Confident and full of kick-ass feminism, she manages somehow to combine femininity with her own brand of swagger. \u201cThere\u2019s always been tough ladies around me,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mom and my grandmother\u2014and my dad\u2019s a feminist, too. They instilled this \u2018You can do it\u2019 attitude.\u201d"], "authors": ["Dodie Kazanjian", "Dodie Kazanjia"], "keywords": ["sarah", "national", "ready", "art", "ive", "cain", "pandemic", "im", "space", "gallery", "work", "atrium", "cats"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
