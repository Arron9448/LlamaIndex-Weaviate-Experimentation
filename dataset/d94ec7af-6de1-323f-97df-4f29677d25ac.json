It is time for the Maghrib, the fourth of the five daily prayers of devout Muslims. It is clear even before they reach the building\u2019s high yellow walls that all is not right. The prayer-hall\u2019s four minarets, topped by golden crescent moons, are still a towering landmark. But they are covered in scaffolding and green netting and they are not due for repair.", "It is less than six years since hundreds of Muslim men gathered in the mosque\u2019s courtyard to celebrate the completion of its new Arab-style prayer hall. It had cost 9.8m yuan ($1.37m)\u2014a tidy sum in a county that is officially classified as impoverished. The festivities had official blessing. The imam of one of the most important mosques in Lanzhou, the provincial capital, was there. So, too, was a senior leader of the government-backed Islamic Association of China.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Much has changed. A chill political wind has been blowing over Duanjiaping and hundreds of other villages and towns in Linxia, a majority-Muslim prefecture in Gansu province, which borders on the Tibetan plateau and the far-western region of Xinjiang. Many villages in Linxia have at least one mosque, with minarets visible far and wide. The one with the scaffolding in Duanjiaping can accommodate 3,000 worshippers. Its grandeur is not unusual. In recent decades rural communities in Linxia\u2014China\u2019s \u201clittle Mecca\u201d, as it is often called\u2014have vied to outdo each other in mosque-building. Now the government is not only reining them in, it is tightening controls on their faith as well.", "The horrors of China\u2019s campaign against Islam in Xinjiang are well known. About two years ago reports began to emerge of the building of a vast gulag there. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uighurs have been thrown into it\u2014many simply for seeming too pious. There are about 10m Uighurs in China. But they form only about half of the country\u2019s Muslim population. Linxia is home to more than 1.1m Muslims, mainly belonging to two ethnic groups: the Hui and the Dongxiang. There are Muslim communities scattered widely across the rest of China (see map). Most are made up of Huis. Because of Xinjiang\u2019s history of separatism and terrorism, Uighurs are suffering by far the harshest clampdown experienced by any of these Muslim groups. Outside Xinjiang, however, other believers are starting to feel the effects, too.", "The government\u2019s attitude towards Muslims in the interior began to change in 2016 after China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, set out plans for the \u201csinicisation\u201d of the country\u2019s religions. Christianity and Islam, having strong overseas connections, became the main targets. Officials set out to purge them of foreign influences deemed threatening to the Communist Party. In the case of Islam the aim was partly to prevent the spread of radicalism and with it, terrorism.", "Among Muslims elsewhere in China, however, there have been no reports of terrorist links. The Huis were once China\u2019s model Muslims, quite unlike the Uighurs in Xinjiang who have chafed at Chinese rule for decades. A few Uighurs have occasionally used violence to vent their grievances. The Huis have no separatist ambitions. They claim descendancy from Arab and Persian traders who settled more than a millennium ago. After centuries of intermarriage they have become ethnically assimilated with Han Chinese, who make up more than 90% of the population. Huis in Linxia have historically played an important role as middlemen in trade between Tibetan and Han communities. Many have grown rich by trading a Chinese medicine that is often used as an aphrodisiac, known as caterpillar fungus. It is harvested from the Tibetan hills. Linxia is home to one of the country\u2019s biggest caterpillar-fungus wholesale markets; its traders are mostly Muslims.", "But as the scaffolding in Duanjiaping shows, the government worries that Muslims in Linxia are absorbing the same influences from Islam abroad that it says have fuelled strife in Xinjiang. \u201cRight now, work related to Islam is even more complicated than it has ever been before,\u201d Gansu\u2019s party chief, Lin Duo, told a meeting of senior officials in July last year.", "Off with their domes", "One aim of the sinicisation campaign is to reduce visible links between Islam in China and that in the Arab world. China fears that Saudi Arabia in particular\u2014as much a draw to Muslim pilgrims in China as to those elsewhere\u2014will poison Chinese Islam with Wahhabism, a puritanical strain that is often linked with extremism. But its efforts to prevent this are affecting many Muslims who have no truck with militancy. In March officials in the southern city of Guangzhou announced rewards of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,405) for reporting on \u201cillegal religious activities\u201d, including organising private trips to Mecca. China\u2019s Muslims can join only officially arranged ones.", "The mosque in Duanjiaping is a casualty. Officials have ordered it to remove its Arab-style minarets and replace them with Chinese-looking ones. A picture of what the mosque will eventually look like is displayed in the entrance. The minarets will have green-tiled upturned eaves in Chinese style. The central bulbous dome will be replaced by a pavilion-like structure, also classically Chinese.", "\u201cThe government says we have to do it, so we\u2019re doing it,\u201d says a caretaker. The work will not offend religious sensibilities and will be done at the government\u2019s expense, he claims. That contrasts with reports from other places where similar work is being carried out. In a nearby town, Kangle, a nervous Hui surveys another mosque with scaffolding on its minarets. He says \u201ctrouble\u201d broke out there a few days earlier when local religious-affairs officials ordered their demolition. They were erected in 2014. The following year the mosque was named a \u201cmodel religious site\u201d by Linxia\u2019s government. No longer, it seems.", "In August last year there was trouble on a much bigger scale in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a province bordering on Gansu that is home to about one-fifth of China\u2019s Hui people. For three days thousands of Muslims in the town of Weizhou staged protests at a massive mosque\u2014initially over a government order that the entire building be knocked down because it had not received planning permission, and subsequently over a revised proposal that only the domes be removed. Remarkably, the local government backed down. But it was clearly worried about the turmoil. In November the party chief of Ningxia visited Xinjiang, where he signed counter-terrorism \u201cco-operation agreements\u201d. He noted religious similarities between the two provinces and said, ominously: \u201cThat\u2019s why Ningxia went to learn from Xinjiang.\u201d", "In Gansu the official Islamic Association has circulated 20 recommended designs for mosque roofs \u201cwith Chinese characteristics\u201d. Officials say they want no more \u201cSaudi-isation\u201d or \u201cArab-isation\u201d of buildings. The association has instructed Muslims to forsake the common practice of building or expanding mosques without government permission and to make them less \u201cvast and extravagant\u201d. It has also tried to tighten its control over the religion itself. It has ordered Gansu\u2019s teachers of Islam to reject any new doctrine from outsiders. \u201cAnything that does not already exist at home should not be accepted from abroad,\u201d said the association\u2019s annual report, published in March. \u201cIf something does not exist locally then it should not be approved if it is introduced from elsewhere.\u201d", "Part of the sinicisation effort is called the \u201cfour-enter\u201d campaign. This means ensuring that four things are introduced into every mosque: the Chinese flag, propaganda concerning China\u2019s laws on religion, \u201ccore socialist values\u201d and the country\u2019s \u201coutstanding traditional culture\u201d. In Linxia, the impact is clear. The flag flies over many mosques. Billboards proclaiming socialism\u2019s importance to Islam fill their courtyards. Preachers have been told to incorporate these values in their scriptural teachings. And they must undergo regular testing on such matters to retain their permits to teach. Linxia\u2019s party chief, Guo Heli, tried to put a positive spin on the clampdown during a visit to local mosques in June. \u201cWe must reduce the frequency, duration and scale of religious activities,\u201d he said, suggesting this would \u201clessen the burden\u201d on the faithful.", "The authorities are also trying to reduce Islam\u2019s influence in society. In Linxia this involves curbing the \u201cproliferation\u201d of the use of the term \u201chalal\u201d. Provincial officials have accused Linxia\u2019s main city of \u201cgiving too much prominence to religious aspects\u201d in its plans to expand the local halal-products industry. As part of the de-Arabisation campaign, officials have ordered restaurants to stop using the word \u201chalal\u201d in Arabic on their signs, as many once did. Only traces now remain. On many Muslim restaurants across China, including recently in Beijing, such lettering has been painted over or prised out.", "By changing the design of Duanjiaping\u2019s mosque officials may hope to reduce Islam\u2019s profile, just as officials on the coast have been trying to make Christianity less visible by removing hundreds of large crosses from the tops of churches. In line with regulations issued last year forbidding the building of mosques that are \u201coverly tall\u201d, the new minarets in Duanjiaping will be much lower. Mosques have also been ordered to install less-powerful loudspeakers. Officials have stepped up efforts to keep children out of them and bar minors from religious instruction.", "The government\u2019s controls over Islam are still relatively relaxed in Linxia compared with those in Xinjiang, where Muslims, if they are not thrown into \u201cvocational training centres\u201d (ie, prison camps), are subject to intense digital surveillance, a heavy police presence and intrusions into their homes by prying officials. Many of Linxia\u2019s mosques retain their Arab-style minarets (locals say they are cheaper to build than Chinese-style ones, which require skilled carpenters and expensive wood). Only a handful of mosques have so far been told to rebuild theirs, says a local Hui-culture expert. Extremism, he says, \u201chas not become a trend\u201d locally.", "But the authorities insist it is spreading. In July the leader of a central-government inspection team said that in some parts of Gansu \u201creligious extremist forces\u201d were already \u201cdominating and corroding\u201d grassroots political bodies. This was, she said, \u201ca problem worth attention\u201d. Extremist is a word that trips lightly off officials\u2019 tongues. It is often used to describe behaviour that in many other countries would be regarded simply as devout. Muslims in the rest of China may not suffer the Uighurs\u2019 terrible fate, but they have reason to be nervous. \u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2019/09/26/chinas-repression-of-islam-is-spreading-beyond-xinjiang", "title": "China\u2019s repression of Islam is spreading beyond Xinjiang", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["spreading", "xinjiang", "mosque", "repression", "chinas", "muslims", "religious", "mosques", "linxia", "china", "minarets", "islam", "officials"]}
