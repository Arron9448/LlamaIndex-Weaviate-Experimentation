The crowded city runs regularly without power, has few cinemas or sporting clubs and a bare handful of parks in which children can play.", "The trips to the beach were signal occasions in a young life in the territory, and while the gentle waves and blue water appealed, Saleh and his siblings were forbidden from swimming.", "\u201cMy mother would never let us,\u201d Saleh tells the Guardian through an interpreter. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed in the water. She wanted us to be safe, and she was worried because we couldn\u2019t swim well.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hasan Alhabil at Sydney\u2019s Manly beach.

Last summer, in 2019, seven people died.\u201d", "Here in Australia, the beach is very safe, it\u2019s very clean and well-organised. Hasan Alhabil", "Saleh\u2019s family are Palestinian refugees who fled to Gaza when they were forced from their ancestral home in 1948. For 10 of Saleh\u2019s formative childhood years his father was in an Israeli jail; his extended family has lost dozens of members to the violence of the occupation over decades. His mother\u2019s over-protectiveness, he says, was a response to the precariousness of his family\u2019s existence.", "\u201cBut I want children in Gaza to learn to enjoy the beach, and to be safe when they swim. I want to establish a program like Nippers to teach children about lifesaving.\u201d", "Nippers is the Australian surf lifesaving program for children, with more than 60,000 currently enrolled, beginning at age five.", "But beyond the surf club\u2019s mandate for patrolling the beach and saving lives in the water, a surf club in Gaza can provide a powerful sense of solidarity and fellowship. In a territory where youth unemployment runs at 60%, a surf club can serve as a place of community, an outlet of physical activity and shared purpose for young Palestinians.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mohammed Saleh and Hasan Alhabil will be assessed for their bronze medallion, the fundamental Australian lifesaving qualification, in late January.

Because there is no electricity and power often, raw sewage is pushed into the sea. So that means there is less space where it is safe for people to swim.", "\u201cHere in Australia, the beach is very safe, it\u2019s very clean and well-organised. The facilities you have here, we don\u2019t have in Gaza.\u201d", "This might feel only a small thing but it is very powerful. Shamikh Khalil Badra", "In a city ringed by a fortifications, and whose only exits are militarised checkpoints, Gaza\u2019s 45km of shoreline on the Mediterranean is one of the few places to offer a sense of space and of freedom.", "But even this is illusory. A bare few miles off the coast, Israeli navy ships are permanently patrolling, blockading all movement in or out.", "Saleh and Alhabil are in the middle of a month of intensive training at North Steyne club, on Sydney\u2019s Manly Beach.

We are trying to teach that culture we have here.\u201d", "Saleh and Alhabil\u2019s passage from Gaza to Sydney was far from smooth.", "\u201cWe had to stay flexible, and to re-organise things,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cWe thought they were coming and then they weren\u2019t, and then they were again. But we were committed to making it work and to following this through.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hasan Alhabil\u2019s passage from Gaza to Sydney was far from smooth.

A fellow Palestinian now studying in Australia, he says it took the committee nearly four years of negotiations and planning \u2013 with a number of abortive attempts \u2013 to get Saleh and Alhabil to Australia.
