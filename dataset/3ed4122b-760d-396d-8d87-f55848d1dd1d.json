But, like any Bosnian her age, there\u2019s no avoiding the fact that she was formed by the war that broke out in her country in 1992: \u201cI was 17 when it started, and we didn\u2019t understand at first that this was war. We were convinced that Yugoslavia, and especially Bosnia, would never go to war, because it was so mixed. I have Serbian family, I have Croatian family. We were naive. We couldn\u2019t imagine it. We said this will pass. A month or two. There are some stupid people with guns, but they\u2019ll be gone soon. When that didn\u2019t happen, it was a shock, and what it taught us is that everything can turn upside down from one day to another. Life is fragile. The whole system is fragile. This is a feeling that I carry through life. I don\u2019t take anything for granted, especially not institutions.\u201d", "\u017dbani\u0107\u2019s gut-wrenching new film, Quo Vadis, Aida?, deals with one of the war\u2019s most heinous atrocities: the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, during which Bosnian Serb forces under the command of Ratko Mladi\u0107 executed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys \u2013 a genocide the United Nations forces deployed to protect the inhabitants of the supposedly \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica did almost nothing to prevent. By the time of Srebrenica, \u017dbani\u0107 had been living under siege in Sarajevo for almost three years; she might have been preoccupied only with her own problems. But what she heard in the weeks and months that followed stayed with her. \u201cHere was another shock,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was a UN-protected area. We felt that if the aggression could not be stopped by the UN, then there were no human rights we could believe in \u2013 and from that moment, I was obsessed. I wanted to know everything about it. It was a trauma for all Bosnians. When we learned how many people had died, and how they had died, and how they were buried. When we learned that the graves had been moved [in an effort to cover up the massacre].\u201d", "Ten years ago, she began to think someone should make a film about it: \u201cBut I was really hoping it wouldn\u2019t be me. It\u2019s such a hot political subject, even now. There is still huge denial from Serbian politicians that it even happened. Enter this territory, and everyone is against you, because it\u2019s still so present. People continue to live with it. They have their own pain, and their own ideas of what such a film should look like.\u201d What persuaded her in the end? Perhaps it was that she knew now that she could do it. Her 2006 film Grbavica, about the postwar life of a Bosnian woman who was raped by a Serbian soldier, had won a Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival. But she was pulled along, too, by her deep conviction that film has the power to change minds. \u201cThis past of ours,\u201d she says, vehemently (she\u2019s talking to me via Zoom from her cottage in the south of Bosnia). \u201cThe tendency is to deny, or to hide, or to make false facts. But in order to move on, we have to see it.\u201d", "In Serbia, Mladi\u0107 is still considered a hero, even after his conviction as a war criminal. How to capture his essence?", "Quo Vadis, Aida? follows a UN translator \u2013 a character loosely inspired by Hasan Nuhanovi\u0107, who published a book about his own experiences \u2013 inside the base at Srebrenica, minute by minute, hour by hour, as she fights to save her sons and husband from Mladi\u0107\u2019s men. The Dutch soldiers for whom she\u2019s working tell her that no exceptions can be made; that her family, too, must go with the Serbians on their buses; that they have received guarantees all those taken will be safe. But she knows their words are empty, even as it falls to her to relay similar promises through a loudhailer to the thousands of hungry and terrified civilians \u2013 many of them her friends and neighbours \u2013 who have sought protection at the base. For many different reasons, the film is a remarkable achievement; \u017dbani\u0107 deals so deftly with such freighted material (she also wrote the screenplay). Chief among them, however, is the astonishing performance of Jasna \u0110uri\u010di\u0107, who plays the translator, Aida Selmanagic \u2013 one for which she deserves to win all the prizes.", "\u201cMaking the film was a responsibility for all of us,\u201d says \u017dbani\u0107. \u201cBut for Jasna, and for Boris [Isakovi\u0107, who plays Mladi\u0107], there were huge issues. The [hostile] response from some to my film Grbavica meant that they knew what they could expect when it came out \u2013 and they\u2019re both Serbians. It was brave and progressive of them to take on these roles. For Jasna, it was hard, hard work: she met some of the mothers [of the dead], and her responsibility was to them. For Boris, there was the issue that, in Serbia, Mladi\u0107 is still considered a hero, even after his conviction as a war criminal. How to play him? How to capture his essence, this man who has the power over people\u2019s lives, who is like a god?\u201d", "A remarkable achievement... Quo Vadis, Aida? Photograph: Imrana Kapetanovic", "What has been the response to the film in Bosnia? This is complicated. Bosnia, even now, is divided into the two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Republika Srpska. \u017dbani\u0107 and her producers made the decision to premiere Quo Vadis, Aida? at the memorial centre in Srebrenica, which is technically in the latter, to an audience of young people from all sides (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian); there was also a screening for survivors. \u201cThose who were born long after these events were moved,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of those on the Serbian side live under the influence of a media that encourages them not to feel for Muslims, and the film emancipated that part of their brains. It allowed them to cry. As for the survivors, they told me that it was how they remembered it.\u201d But in the rest of Republika Srpska, the Serbian-dominated part of the country, the film has yet to be shown. \u201cThe cinema owners are too frightened. They fear the government will give them the kind of punishments that cannot be proved: financial inspections, for instance. To get round this, we suggested underground screenings that we would not even announce. But they said no, someone will find out. A group of boys will be paid to throw stones at the cinema.\u201d", "Catharsis... \u017dbani\u0107, third left, prays at the memorial cemetery in Potocari, before the first public showing of Quo Vadis, Aida? Photograph: Kemal Softic/AP", "It gives her particular pleasure that young audiences find the film gripping: a thriller, of sorts. \u201cMy thesis film at film school was about mass graves,\u201d she says, with a black laugh. \u201cThis is where I grew up! Even sex was used as a weapon here. But I remember my professor saying: look, this isn\u2019t a document for submission to an international tribunal. It\u2019s a movie.\u201d All directors believe in film as a medium, but when \u017dbani\u0107 talks about the way culture in general, and film in particular, can bring people together, she speaks with more authority than most. \u201cIn the siege, we quickly resumed normal activities that were not normal at all in the circumstances, and there was a feeling that by going to the theatre or a film festival, dressed up nicely, you were showing that you were not a victim, that this barbarism would not win. It is really true that we needed culture almost as much as we needed food. To see a film with others, even in crazy conditions, a VHS tape screened against a wall, huddled together: it was very human, and it kept me sane through it all. It gave me the sense I have even now that a film is more than a film. It is life. That\u2019s where my love for it comes from.\u201d", "Quo Vadis, Aida? is not, she says, against the UN, though she believes its failings in Srebrenica were extremely grave: \u201cOn the contrary, it\u2019s about how to make it stronger, and more able to protect human rights.\u201d She believes that people talk too glibly about war. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if Srebrenica was happening at this moment, the outcome would be the same. Europe is more disunited now, and rightwing forces more in evidence. If this were the constellation of political powers, no one would lift a finger to help the Bosnians \u2013 and this is what is scary. We say never again, but there\u2019s nothing behind our words. Bosnia is still considered \u2018other\u2019 in Europe. I was at a gathering where the European Film Academy president said that there had been no war in Europe for 70 years, and all I could think was: \u2018Were the 100,000 people who died in Bosnia not Europeans?\u2019 But we don\u2019t count.\u201d In Bosnia, she believes, no one won. \u201cThe fascists are still around us. The victims and the perpetrators live alongside one other, because only the big guys were sentenced. That is very hard, and I hope my film allows people to talk about it \u2013 about the fact that peace doesn\u2019t just come like lightning to burn all the bad things down.\u201d", "Quo Vadis, Aida? is on Curzon Home Cinema from 22 January"], "authors": ["Rachel Cooke"], "keywords": ["jasmila", "serbian", "\u017ebani\u0107", "war", "vadis", "film", "life", "bosnian", "bosnia", "aida", "quo", "director", "srebrenica"], "pubDate": "2021-01-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
