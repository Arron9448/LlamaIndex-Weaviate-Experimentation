At that time in my life, there was no way I would have been able to meet someone out and about. It just wasn\u2019t going to happen.", "I was too busy with school and getting ready for competing in pageants. I was completely not in the dating scene at that point in my life. Spencer was also working 12-hour shifts as a cop. So he certainly wasn\u2019t able to go out and meet people. And at this point, I feel like everyone meets online in some way or whatever, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Instagram. It may not be a dating app. But a lot of people meet their significant others online right now or just go on social media.", "Fox News: You were dating your now-husband Spencer when you were Miss America. However, you couldn\u2019t speak about him publicly. How were you dealing with that?", "Maxwell: It was incredibly tough, honestly.

So all you want to do is talk about the things you can\u2019t be around, that you can\u2019t be with. You want to talk about the things that bring you joy, the things you miss. And I was missing the people I love so much. And it was really hard being taken away from that, especially when you grow up in such a close-knit family.", "I couldn\u2019t post on social media that I had a boyfriend or post pictures of him.

Where did we land yesterday?\u201d And then I\u2019m flying out the next day\u2026 There are days where you\u2019re just so confused and your mind is in a million places.

In order to stay grounded and get through all of that, I needed to have a strong faith. I wasn\u2019t with my family or the people that loved and supported me. I was really on my own. All I really had was God. All I had was my faith.

Christ is the foundation of my marriage and my relationship with my husband. I start and end each day with God. I love to read my devotional. I need to start and end each day with a prayer.
