The government does not agree that victims should automatically be granted leave to remain for 12 months.\u201d", "The letter added: \u201cThe government does not have an absolute exclusion from detention for any particular group.\u201d It said that if the government did detain victims of trafficking who were vulnerable, assessments known as adults at risk were carried out and the detention was authorised by senior Home Office officials. Atkins\u2019 letter outlines a series of measures the Home Office is taking to support trafficking victims.", "According to Home Office data obtained by After Exploitation through freedom of information requests, 1,256 potential trafficking victims were detained in 2019.", "The private member\u2019s bill, along with a letter last October signed by dozens of NGOs, calls for increased protection for trafficking victims, particularly those at risk of deportation because they are not UK nationals.", "If trafficking victims are deported, not only are their lives potentially put at risk but valuable intelligence about who trafficked them could be lost.", "Esslemont said: \u201cIn order to be recognised as a survivor, victims are first referred by \u2018first responders\u2019 and then assessed via a two-stage process sometimes lasting years. It is insulting that even where victims undergo the gruelling steps requested of them, the government cannot meet survivors halfway with incredibly basic and short-term protection.", "\u201cThe current system of support and recognition is unsustainable and makes it difficult for non-UK survivors to report crime due to the threat of deportation or detention. Equally, UK survivors cannot be confident about the length of support, such as access to safe housing, they will receive if they come forward. Until the government creates a culture of safety for those exploited, it is impossible to win the trust of survivors who are rightfully fearful of seeking help.\u201d", "Atkins said in a statement: \u201cThe government is committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and ensuring that victims are provided with the support they need to rebuilt their lives. We have already implemented a number of significant reforms to the national referral mechanism aimed at improving the speed, quality and independence of the decision-making, and offering the best possible support for victims.\u201d"], "authors": ["Diane Taylor"], "keywords": ["plans", "office", "bill", "minister", "uk", "rejects", "extra", "trafficking", "support", "survivors", "risk", "victims", "slavery", "letter"], "pubDate": "2021-01-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
