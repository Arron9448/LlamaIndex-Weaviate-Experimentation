It reads partly as an art book, partly as a download of the smartest conversations taking place on social media\u2014\u201ca series of guideposts for current and future generations,\u201d according to the introduction, \u201cwho may be curious about what our generation has been creating during a time defined by social, cultural, economic, and ecological revolution.\u201d The book mingles wide-ranging essays and interviews, memes and works of art; a text on trans visibility from activist Raquel Willis abuts an ode to Black barbershops from photographer Antonio \u201cTone\u201d Johnson; a family recipe for coconut bread by Pierre Serrao, cofounder of Ghetto Gastro, sits next to a history of Baltimore\u2019s arabbers\u2014merchants who sell fruits and vegetables from a horse-drawn cart\u2014by the writer Lawrence Burney. (Meanwhile, a clever system of color coding conceived by designers Wael Morcos and Jon Key casts observations on social media in yellow, instructions in green, \u201cprophetic prose and poetry\u201d in black, and \u201cincendiary essays and artworks\u201d in white.) \u201cI just hope that anyone who interacts with the book leaves with a broader sense of what Black people are up to,\u201d Drew says. \u201cIn moments like these, when everyone\u2019s like, Whoa, you guys have been hurt this whole time?, it\u2019s like, Wow, you just didn\u2019t dare to dream about us.\u201d", "Nadia Huggins\u2019s 2014 photograph Circa no future (above) accompanies an essay by marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson about protecting the world\u2019s oceans.

As the title suggests, Black Futures isn\u2019t only about right now\u2014it also considers what happens next. \u201cIt\u2019s an invitation to imagine,\u201d Wortham says. \u201cIt\u2019s an invitation for rest. It\u2019s an invitation to get angry and find a place for that anger. People keep asking us, What do the Black futures hold?
