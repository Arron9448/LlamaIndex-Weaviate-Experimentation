I am assigned male at birth, but recently have been feeling more non-binary and/or gender fluid. Lockdown has seen me wearing scrubs to work daily but has allowed me to explore wearing a dress at home. I look forward to being able to do so with friends outside home so it doesn\u2019t feel as much of a big secret. I\u2019ve got one that I really like, which is dark pink.
