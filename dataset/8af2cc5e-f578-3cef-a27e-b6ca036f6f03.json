In 1997 Rowson was at a fundraising dinner for the trust at St James\u2019 Palace and was summoned to meet the duke along with the Times cartoonist Peter Brookes.", "Philip asked whether any of Rowson\u2019s work was syndicated. \u201cI said I had no idea,\u201d said Rowson.", "\u201cHe then turned to Brookes who bowed low and said: \u2018Peter Brookes, sir, the Times,\u2019 at which point Phil the Greek exploded \u2026 \u2018The Times? Bloody Murdoch rag! Wouldn\u2019t have it in the house! Dreadful self-righteous rubbish!\u2019", "\u201cAt which point I interjected to say that the Guardian was the self-righteous one, to which he replied: \u2018Not as bad as the bloody Times!\u2019 and stalked off. Needless to say, he went up considerably in my estimation at this point and his comments are worth bearing in mind as all those News International \u2013 as was \u2013 papers drool over his memory. He clearly hated them.\u201d", "Rowson said it was \u201ca delightful evening\u201d and there was no question of Philip joking. \u201cIt was a visceral reaction \u2026 it was very, very funny.\u201d", "The encounter was long before the trust had established a national home for the Cartoon Museum. That was opened by Philip, close to the British Museum, in 2006. In 2009 it relocated to a new spot on Wells Street near London\u2019s Oxford Circus.", "The museum said Philip\u2019s connection went back all the way to 1949 when he and the young Princess Elizabeth attended the Royal College of Arts and listened to a speech by HM Bateman calling for a national museum of cartoons.", "\u201cHe has given the museum continuous support and with his great love of humour he admired the genre of British cartooning,\u201d said the museum, identifying Giles as his favourite cartoonist.", "\u201cThe monarchy have been a persistent (and easy) target of cartoonists and caricaturists for 300 years, from Gillray and Beerbohm to Scarfe, Bell, Rowson and Peter Brookes \u2013 but the Duke of Edinburgh could always see the funny side in any situation, and took humorous depictions of himself in his stride,\u201d it said.", "Rowson agrees. His Guardian cartoon marking Philip\u2019s death depicts him on a cloud going up to the pearly gates looking at a choir of angels, saying \u201cthose are bloody big grouse\u201d. \u201cWhich I think he would laugh at,\u201d Rowson said. \u201cI think he\u2019d find it very funny.\u201d"], "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "keywords": ["martin", "recalls", "philips", "cartoon", "prince", "murdoch", "trust", "museum", "times", "selfrighteous", "rag", "verdict", "rowson", "bloody", "point", "philip"], "pubDate": "2021-04-10T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
