But a feature common to all is the sense of coming into contact with the cosmic. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s no boundary between you and others, or you and the universe,\u201d notes Johns Hopkins\u2019 Barrett, saying that virtually all subjects in psilocybin studies have reported such a feeling of oneness. \u201cSome people call this an experience of God, or nirvana.\u201d I went into my first ketamine journey matter-of-factly, with a problem to solve, and even so, that first trip commenced with a vision of the world rewinding, a kind of reverse big bang that exposed the heretofore invisible filaments connecting everyone and everything. The vision moved me\u2014tears puddled behind my eye mask\u2014and then it yielded to more personal impressions, such as a recurring image of myself, age six or seven, playing with my dollhouse.", "\u201cWhat do you think was important about the dollhouse?\u201d Teodori asked me in our post-trip call. I was still pretty woozy as we Zoomed\u2014the effect wore off by the next day\u2014but suddenly, it was like a light bulb went on in my head. \u201cI think\u2026I think I was remembering what it felt like to create without smoking,\u201d I told her. \u201cWhen there wasn\u2019t any pressure, and I could just play.\u201d", "This download is part of integration, another cornerstone of modern psychedelic medicine. \u201cThe goal is to take advantage of the neuroplastic state, which lasts for about a week after dosing,\u201d explains Beynon. \u201cYou want the changes in your brain to stick, so the question becomes, How do you turn these new thoughts into new behaviors?\u201d For me, this entailed finding ways to get back in touch with that dollhouse sense of play.", "Easier said than done. My ketamine experiences were clarifying and often even profound, but they didn\u2019t change certain nerve-racking facts of life, such as that I write for a living and thus have deadlines to meet if I wish to pay my bills. Or that it\u2019s hard\u2014like, really hard\u2014to stay motivated in the midst of a global pandemic, when each day brings fresh spurs to panic and depression. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge mental-health crisis happening parallel to, and in response to, this pandemic,\u201d notes Benjamin Brody, M.D., assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, and chief of the Division of Inpatient Psychiatry at the university hospital, where ketamine infusions are typically administered. \u201cPeople who are grieving, people who have lost jobs, people who are feeling disconnected, whose lives have been upended .\u2026\u201d With demand for care rising \u201cacross the board,\u201d as Brody notes, it\u2019s no surprise that psychiatrists such as Amanda Itzkoff, M.D., are seeing a huge uptick in inquiries about ketamine therapy.
