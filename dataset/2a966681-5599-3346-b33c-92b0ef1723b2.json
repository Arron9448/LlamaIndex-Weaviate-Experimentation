Sennhauser also plates the dishes on genuine airline crockery, and presents it as a proper airplane meal.", "A new lockdown talent", "It's a time-consuming project. Sennhauser has never been into cooking, he says -- for starters, he wouldn't have had time before the pandemic.", "And at the start of lockdown, when people were posting pictures and videos of themselves enjoying fake plane journeys, despite being a prolific poster of life on board, and selfies taken in plane bathrooms, he didn't take part.", "But then, he says, on week three of lockdown, \"I was really bored and just did it,\" making an airline-style meal, and posting a photo.", "He quickly found a community of people doing the same thing -- blogs asking readers to recreate their plane experience, and people posting photos of themselves eating off plastic trays.", "\"I thought, 'Oh, lots of people are doing it. It's not exciting anymore',\" he says. So he stopped it.", "Related content Finnair is selling its airplane food in grocery stores", "He spent the rest of Scotland's back-to-back lockdowns ignoring the aviation world. But one day in January 2021, thanks to a combination of \"boredom, being stuck at home, and really missing traveling,\" he decided to have another go.", "He already owned a genuine airline trolley, bought on eBay along with airline crockery and cutlery: melamine plates, champagne flutes, retro economy glasses, and china plates and coffee cups from various business classes. Most of it is bought online -- there's a major market for it in Germany, he says -- although he admits that, \"In turbulence, the odd spoon here and there has slipped off the tray and fallen into my pocket.\"", "So on this cold lockdown day in January, he opened up his trolley and got his plates out. \"And I started plating again, just for fun.\"", "He started with a random airline-style breakfast: sausages with scrambled eggs, spinach, plus a pot of ham, cheese and gherkins.", "Two months on, Sennhauser has a new hobby.

So it needs to be edible.", "\"So I actually had to go and consult cookbooks and the internet for all these recipes, and I've learned to cook all these different things. And I've realized I'm quite good at making desserts. I've made a bunch of mousses -- chocolate mousse, white chocolate mousse, dark chocolate mousse -- and they taste much better than what you can get in the shops. So it's been a bit of a journey for me.\"", "Cooking the meals, he says, \"helps me deal with my wanderlust\", and allows him to relive memories of great trips past.", "His breakfasts and brunches are his own invention -- mainly omelets and sausages, as you'd find on a plane.", "But the dinners are full meals that he's been served onboard in the past -- not just the main course, but also the appetizers, sides and desserts.", "The schnitzel that made a friendship", "Although he's traveled a lot in business class, thanks to a canny use of airline points, Sennhauser isn't above recreating meals he's had in economy.", "One of his favorite recent meals is a recreation of an Austrian Airlines meal -- travelers in economy can preorder a tray made by caterers Do&Co, featuring signature dishes including a wiener schnitzel.", "\"Having grown up in Austria, wiener schnitzel is one of my favorite dishes of all time, so I recreated that, along with a potato salad, cucumber salad and chocolate mousse,\" he says.", "When he makes a meal, he plates it on airline-appropriate crockery and posts pictures of the original, plus his recreation, on Instagram", "His fellow avgeeks are enthusiastic.", "\"They always say that mine looks better than the real deal,\" he says. \"But then, you know, I get to spend a whole day cooking this, plating it in my kitchen, whereas on a plane, in the galley, there's only so much they can do, especially in economy class.\"", "But in the case of the Austrian Airlines schnitzel, Sennhauser realized that one crucial thing was missing: the signature triangular Austrian Airlines plate.", "He posted his before and after photos explaining that he didn't have the right plate -- and then something wonderful happened.

And it gives me joy during this time when I can't travel. It's helped me deal with it.\"", "Reliving a honeymoon flight", "Some of the meals have reminded him of major life events. To celebrate five years since their honeymoon, last month Sennhauser recreated a meal from his honeymoon flight to New York.", "He and husband Graham had flown on SWISS -- \"in business class because it was our honeymoon\" -- and were served spaetzle with beef stroganoff and a side salad, plus chocolate mousse with a raspberry coulis.", "As he does with all his meals, Sennhauser created it all -- right down to the spaetzle -- from scratch, taking half a day to make it. \"It was a nice way to celebrate our honeymoon anniversary,\" he says.", "The magic of airplane food", "Of course, few people are as fond of plane food as this -- in fact, for most travelers, it's a running joke. But Sennhauser thinks that's because most of us aren't giving it a fair go.", "\"I think people who hate it probably have unrealistic expectations,\" he says.", "\"You have to take into account that you're in a metal tube at 40,000 feet being catapulted through the air, and the flight attendant is heating up a meal in an oven -- there's only so much they can do. Also, I think people don't like to be given just two options.", "\"People compare it to what they can get in a restaurant, but it's a completely different species, plane food. There's only so much you can do, and I think people are unrealistic of the circumstances.", "\"I'm not saying it's better than what you can get on the ground, at all -- but if you take into account the amount of work and effort that goes into, it from the person who designs it to the to the team that tests it, the chefs who cook it, the people who package it, wrap it up, put it in the trolley and onto the plane, the flight attendants who then take it out, put it in the oven and serve it with a smile.", "\"It's a different beast to what you get in a restaurant, and I take that into account. I mean, most of the time it's not as good as a restaurant, but you're in a plane! And that's what makes it magical.\"", "That said, not all his experiences have been good. He picks out an Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to Chicago in 2012 as a low point -- \"it was just pasta with beef and tomato sauce that wasn't very good at all -- and all I remember about the rest of the flight is that I was very uncomfortable having eaten that meal\" -- but adds that \"it's probably not fair on them anymore because the airline was going through a rough time.\"", "And before you think he's a plane food snob, he also mentions easyJet's previous catering as one of his favorites.", "\"I really liked a croque monsieur that they had, but then they changed the suppliers, I think. And yeah, it wasn't good enough.

One of my favorite meals in economy is Thai Airways, because there's always a curry. The best meal I had was on Singapore Airlines, and I had Singaporean chicken curry for breakfast.", "\"It came in a giant bowl with rice and sweet bread rolls, and I could not stop eating. I really wished I hadn't stuffed my face beforehand in the lounge.\"", "And although he says a general rule of thumb is to never pick steak, a signature steak dish on SWISS business class he once had, was \"not only one of the best meals I've had on a plane, it was probably the best steak I've had in my life -- tender, juicy and still rare inside, not rubbery and gray as it usually is on a plane.\"", "How to DIY airline meals", "Sadly, Sennhauser doesn't see post-pandemic plane food being quite as special.", "\"So much has changed over the past year with food on planes obviously, because of restrictions and precautions. The pre-order meals, which were always great fun to take advantage of, many of them have disappeared because not as many people are traveling and airlines have to cut costs.", "\"Austrian Airlines and Swiss have now cut their economy class meals on shorter flights and often scratch their pre-order meal service.
