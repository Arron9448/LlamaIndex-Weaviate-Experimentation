The director, Sean McNamara, a veteran of Hallmark movies and Disney kids\u2019 series, sat at monitors nearby. \u201cO.K.!\u201d he called out. \u201cYou\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re making cookies, it\u2019s Christmas, and action! \u201d The actors rolled dough and picked up cookie cutters. The montage would be dialogue-free, overlaid with music; to set the tone, McNamara cued up \u201cJingle Bell Rock.\u201d The cast began to bob. \u201cGood, but we probably shouldn\u2019t be dancing!\u201d McNamara yelled. One actor, looking serious, lifted an icing bag. \u201cRemember, you\u2019re having fun, and there\u2019s funny stuff going on!\u201d McNamara said. The actors burst into smiles and laughter. \u201cNow the cake!\u201d McNamara said. Paul Greene, a former J. Crew model and the male lead, presented the group with a white fondant cake topped with pine trees. They shook powdered sugar on it. \u201cCut!\u201d McNamara yelled. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d The Hallmark Channel is a cable network owned and operated by the greeting-card company. This year, the channel and a sister network, Hallmark Movies and Mysteries, produced a hundred and three original movies; forty are about Christmas. Since 2011, from late October to January, Hallmark has broadcast Christmas movies nearly twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. (The Hallmark Movie Checklist app, which helps guide viewers to new films, has 1.5 million users.) During this year\u2019s holiday season, the programming, called Countdown to Christmas, has made Hallmark the No. 1 cable network among women between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four, and, in some prime-time slots, No. 1 in households and total viewers. Last year, seventy-two million people watched Countdown to Christmas. Fans talk of turning it on and leaving it on all season; it dominates TV screens in hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cGuys come up to me on the golf course and whisper, \u2018I love your Christmas movies!\u2019 \u201d the actor Cameron Mathison (\u201cThe Christmas Club,\u201d \u201cThe Christmas Ornament\u201d) told me. Lifetime, the women\u2019s network long known for movies with titles like \u201cIn Bed with a Killer\u201d and \u201cYour Husband Is Mine,\u201d now airs its own Hallmark-esque Christmas movies, in a block called It\u2019s a Wonderful Lifetime. Netflix, Ion, Freeform, and OWN have started making them, too. Hallmark films tend to center on independent women with interesting jobs (novelists, chocolatiers) and appealing romantic prospects (princes, firemen). Programming is seasonal; as the year progresses, characters pair up amid winter wonderlands, Valentine\u2019s Day chocolate-making contests, fireworks celebrations, pumpkin patches, and Christmas parties. The familiarity of the films is essential to their success. Hallmark screenplays have nine acts, each of which hits specific plot points\u2014a meet-cute in Act I, before the first commercial, an \u201calmost kiss\u201d in Act VII. The shots are lit with a distinctive warmth. Actors recur. The settings often recall Saturday Evening Post covers by Norman Rockwell, whose painting \u201cShuffleton\u2019s Barbershop\u201d inspired a Hallmark movie of the same name, and several productions have been filmed at ersatz pioneer villages. As Danica McKellar, a Hallmark regular once best known as Winnie Cooper, from \u201cThe Wonder Years,\u201d told me, many actors \u201cbring nostalgia with us.\u201d In Hallmark films, townspeople care for one another, run viable small businesses, and compete in gingerbread bake-offs\u2014America as we might wish it were, and as some believe it once was. It has thrived in the Trump era. Last year, it was one of the only networks to gain viewers besides Fox News and MSNBC. It also depicts a purple America, without guns, MAGA hats, rage. Bill Abbott, the C.E.O. of Crown Media, Hallmark\u2019s entertainment company, told me that it\u2019s \u201cyour place to go to get away from politics, to get away from everything in your life that is problematic and negative, and to feel like there are people out there who are good human beings that could make you feel happy to be part of the human race.\u201d Hallmark\u2019s America is also straight, often Christian, and, until recently, mostly white. Meghan Markle, whose biracial parentage made headlines after her engagement to Prince Harry, starred in two Hallmark movies; in the Fourth of July romance \u201cWhen Sparks Fly,\u201d from 2014, her character had white parents. In 2017, the African-American TV and film actor Holly Robinson Peete pitched a wholesome reality show about her family to Hallmark. \u201cMeet the Peetes\u201d aired for two seasons. \u201cThere were six of us\u2014seven, including my mom\u2014so that was a lot of diversity at once,\u201d she told me. The \u201cEvergreen\u201d series, which began in 2017, now sees Peete playing the mayor of Evergreen, Vermont, a quaint town based on a line of Hallmark cards. The movies begin with a shot of the illustrations that inspired them, some featuring a vintage red pickup truck, which appears in the movies. A miniature of it is available as a Hallmark Christmas decoration, for $39.99. Many Hallmark films involve some form of lucrative \u201cintegration\u201d\u2014product placement. Balsam Hill synthetic Christmas trees appear frequently; in \u201cHoliday Hearts,\u201d from November, an eligible doctor (Paul Campbell) demonstrates the settings of a tree\u2019s remote-controlled lights for a full minute. On the set of \u201cChristmas in Evergreen: Tidings of Joy,\u201d McNamara and his crew shot a scene that featured a foldaway Ninja Foodi oven. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show nine cookies on the sheet,\u201d Sunta Izzicupo, the film\u2019s executive producer, said. On the monitor, an actor approached the oven, said, \u201cNo room? No problem,\u201d opened its door, and inserted a tray of nine cookies shaped like pickup trucks. One theme of \u201cTidings of Joy,\u201d written by Zac Hug, is whether Evergreen is too good to be true. (In some ways, it\u2019s the quintessential Hallmark Christmas movie; in others, it\u2019s a playfully self-aware critique of the genre.) In the film, Katie (Maggie Lawson), a savvy big-city journalist, makes a wish on a magical snow globe, bakes cookies, goes carolling and ice-skating, and watches the unveiling of a time capsule inside a fifteen-foot advent calendar. She also falls in love with Ben (Greene), the local librarian. The day after the cookie shoot, at a historic-house museum in Vancouver, McNamara sat at video monitors in a circa-1895 kitchen, near a hand-cranked wooden telephone. He was about to direct the film\u2019s highest point of tension\u2014the \u201calmost breakup,\u201d usually at the end of Act VIII\u2014which takes place at the Evergreen Library, where Ben has discovered Katie\u2019s notes for what appears to be an expos\u00e9 of the town. Lawson and Greene were surrounded by wreaths, garlands, and Christmas knickknacks. Paper lanterns softened the lighting. Greene, reading Katie\u2019s notes, said, \u201c \u2018Despite the warmth and honest connection these people feel, it\u2019s hard not to wonder how much of Evergreen is an act.\u2019 \u201d His tone hinted at anger. \u201cYeah, I broke up with Kevin. One day he let these two flies crawl all over his eye for, like, an hour and he didn\u2019t even shake his head.\u201d Cartoon by Teresa Burns Parkhurst \u201cCut!\u201d McNamara said. \u201cPaul, you need to take down, like, twenty per cent of the edge.\u201d A key tenet of Hallmark screenplays, the veteran writer-director Ron Oliver told me, is that conflict \u201ccan never seem like it\u2019s gone so far that it can\u2019t be resolved.\u201d In the next take, Greene delivered the line in a tone of gentle disbelief. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d McNamara said.", "In 1910, Joyce Clyde Hall, an entrepreneurial Nebraska teen-ager and the son of a Methodist minister, took a train to Kansas City, Missouri, bringing with him two boxes of postcards. Printed postcards had become a hot commodity, and Hall had a talent for sales. In 1914, he and his older brother Rollie formed a company called Hall Brothers, opened a shop, and began printing their own greeting cards and paper goods. The First World War was a turning point for the industry: servicemen and their loved ones enjoyed sending and receiving cards and became lifelong card buyers. \u201cAnd I saw something else in the custom,\u201d Hall wrote in his 1979 memoir, \u201cWhen You Care Enough\u201d: \u201cA way of giving less articulate people, and those who tend to disguise their feelings, a voice to express their love and affection.\u201d In 1916, Hall Brothers began printing cards that came with their own envelopes; in 1917, they invented modern wrapping paper. The brothers began using the name Hallmark, after a goldsmith\u2019s stamp of quality, in 1928, and later paired it with a crown logo. By mid-century, Hallmark had pioneered a new card-display technique, similar to what we still see in drugstores; formed partnerships with Disney and Norman Rockwell; and built a huge headquarters, in Kansas City. In the process, the company became so intertwined with the idea of holiday celebration that the term \u201cHallmark holiday\u201d entered the public vocabulary, connoting a holiday rooted as much in commercialism as in tradition. In 1951, Joyce Hall wrote to his sales team, \u201cDear Fellows: We\u2019re going to try our hand at television.\u201d Inspired by the medium\u2019s educational and entertainment possibilities, he wanted Hallmark to deliver edifying fare. That year, the company sponsored the first original opera written for television, \u201cAmahl and the Night Visitors\u201d; later, under the name Hallmark Hall of Fame, it sponsored TV productions of literary adaptations, Broadway plays, and, in time, original films. It became the most award-winning franchise in television history, with eighty-one Emmys. Hallmark formed Crown Media in 1991, and ventured into cable. Later that decade, it bought an interest in the religious network Odyssey, which, in 2001, it took over fully, renaming it the Hallmark Channel. According to Bill Abbott, who ran Crown\u2019s advertising sales from 2000 to 2009, before becoming its C.E.O., \u201cthe strategy at the outset wasn\u2019t to draw close to the brand. It didn\u2019t really have a filter.\u201d For a decade, the channel aired motley family entertainment, Hallmark Hall of Fame films, and original movies, made by an independent producer. There were a few standouts. One was the eleven-film \u201cLove Comes Softly\u201d series, released from 2003 to 2011. Based on novels by the Canadian evangelical-Christian writer Janette Oke, the movies are lightly religious frontier dramas set out West. I watched several around 2009; inside the films\u2019 covered wagons and behind their butter churns, I discovered, yellow-haired TV stars like Katherine Heigl and January Jones were living lives of noble forbearance. There were occasional speeches about the Lord, but there was also hardship and heart, \u00e0 la \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d\u2014if Pa hurt his leg, a handsome stranger would help plow the fields. Other films were set in a down-home romanticized present, among characters who proudly respect sentimental art. Some of them praise Norman Rockwell and Thomas Kinkade; in one film, a painter feels betrayed, but then grateful, when her art is used in an ad campaign. \u201cArt is about creativity and being a free spirit,\u201d she says in Act IX, just before the kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s not restrictive or rigid, so why should I be?\u201d Her painting is of Santa Claus. These series and films, along with \u201cThe Christmas Card,\u201d a surprisingly effective love story between a soldier and a mill owner\u2019s daughter, from 2006, helped inspire Abbott, when he became C.E.O., in 2009, to push Hallmark to \u201cembody the brand on TV.\u201d \u201cI love greeting cards and I love Hallmark stores,\u201d Abbott told me when I met him at Hallmark\u2019s Manhattan offices. To him, the stores give a sense of \u201ccomfort, positivity, connections.\u201d \u201cYou should turn on our channel and almost feel like you\u2019re walking into a Gold Crown store,\u201d he said. Abbott is fifty-seven, with thinning gray hair, a warm, confident demeanor, and an adenoidal vocal quality, like a man powering through a cold. He told me that he had been influenced, too, by the distinctive two-minute Hallmark-card commercials that had aired during the Hall of Fame broadcasts, starting in the sixties, which became famous for making viewers cry. In \u201cThe Music Professor,\u201d from 1983, a girl races to arrive at a piano lesson before her teacher and hides a card between the pages of her sheet music. When he finds it, both struggle to contain their emotions. Abbott and his executive team, including Michelle Vicary, Crown Media\u2019s executive vice-president of programming and network publicity, developed a strategy of \u201cleaning into Christmas.\u201d Vicary, who works at Crown Media\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, began her career in music sales, working with bands including Nirvana, Hole, and Mudhoney, but shifted gears because of her \u201cpassion for television,\u201d she told me. (She has been with Crown Media since its beginning.) In 2015, Crown started its own production company, taking control of development, costumes, locations, casting, and post-production. Abbott and Vicary read every script and watch every movie. The Christmas movies are generally shot in fifteen days, in minimal takes and with maximum efficiency, in affordable, often Canadian, locations; they use \u201cactuals\u201d\u2014existing locations, not soundstages. Abbott and Vicary coached the development team to be \u201cbrand ambassadors,\u201d who insure that each element of a production has a distinctive Hallmark feel, down to the decorative mise en sc\u00e8ne. Vicary told me, \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to look at the dailies and call them up and say, \u2018Not enough Christmas.\u2019 \u201d In 2014, Hallmark aired \u201cChristmas Under Wraps,\u201d starring Candace Cameron Bure, who in childhood co-starred on \u201cFull House,\u201d alongside another Hallmark actor, Lori Loughlin. Bure plays a big-city doctor who finds love in Garland, Alaska, which, she correctly suspects, is home to Santa\u2019s workshop. \u201cI guess when it comes down to it, a patient is a patient,\u201d she says, wide-eyed, icing Rudy the Reindeer\u2019s leg. At the beginning, she is striving for a prestigious Boston surgical fellowship; by the end, she has everything she needs right there in Garland. The movie was a \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d Abbott said. Soon afterward, the company ramped up production.", "The Bure breakthrough was a bit like the plot of \u201cChristmas Under Wraps\u201d: Hallmark had discovered that it had everything it needed\u2014positivity, reassurance, sentimentality, and cozy salesmanship\u2014right there in Garland. At that point, the Hallmark Channel had a steady audience of older viewers, but it began bringing in younger ones by casting prominent actors who had starred in edgy teen fare of the two-thousands\u2014Jesse Metcalfe, Chad Michael Murray\u2014and putting them in sweaters and Santa hats. There was something for middle-aged viewers, too\u2014a divorced heroine wooed by a sensitive major-league baseball player, for example, who teaches her son to catch. The movies\u2019 seasonal themes began to venture beyond Christmas, and holiday decorating\u2014even for Halloween or Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014provided a way for characters to bond. (Since the seventies, Hallmark Cards has sold Christmas ornaments and holiday decorations.) As the strategy started to succeed, Hallmark further expanded its fare, introducing a morning show (\u201cHome & Family,\u201d shot in a free-standing house on the Universal lot) and, in 2014, Hallmark Movies and Mysteries, the sister channel, whose titles include \u201cMurder, She Baked: A Peach Cobbler Mystery,\u201d and whose programming broadened, slightly, the company\u2019s tonal register. (In one film, Bure finds a human skull.) Often, at a mystery\u2019s climax, there\u2019s a moment of cathartic, justified violence\u2014for example, a woman clonking a would-be murderer over the head with a piece of pottery. In regular Hallmark Channel films, violence is so seldom seen that even allusions to it can be shocking\u2014such as in \u201cFrom Friend to Fianc\u00e9,\u201d from 2018, when a party scene at a paintball range features a shot of people wielding semiautomatic paintball guns. When I mentioned the off note to Abbott, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a movie we did not write the script for.\u201d It had been produced independently, and guns weren\u2019t its only problem. \u201cIt got past all of us that the word \u2018suck\u2019 is used in the movie,\u201d Abbott said. He grew animated. \u201cI was so mad at myself for not catching it. It\u2019s a word that has become frighteningly close to no longer being part of the four-letter-word category. It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s just a negative, it\u2019s demeaning. It shouldn\u2019t be on our channel.\u201d They edited it out. Several well-known politically conservative actors in Hollywood have been in Hallmark films\u2014Bure, Dean Cain, Jon Voight\u2014but, Abbott said, Hallmark takes pains to be apolitical. \u201cThe only thing we do promote is pet adoption,\u201d he said. \u201cWe make no apologies about that.\u201d The \u201cHome & Family\u201d set has a dedicated pet-adoption area, and pet adoption is a plot point in many movies, including last year\u2019s \u201cRoad to Christmas,\u201d written by Zac Hug. It featured, as minor characters, two attractive young men who co-owned an animal shelter. Seeing this, I was briefly delighted: was this a gay couple, on Hallmark? The moment passed\u2014they didn\u2019t act like a couple or attend a family Christmas gathering together. I mentioned to Abbott that I had thought I had seen a gay couple in a movie; I didn\u2019t say which. \u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was \u2018Road to Christmas.\u2019 \u201d Hallmark wanted to \u201creflect the broader population\u201d where it could, he went on. \u201cAnd we believe that if we do it authentically, without doing it just to do it\u2014which is the wrong reason to do it, by the way\u2014people will feel good about it, regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell that they were gay, I said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s great about it,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThey\u2019re not being called out and made to either look cool or weird.\u201d Hallmark\u2019s sense of authenticity is rooted more firmly, perhaps, in the pioneer village. In 2014, it adapted Janette Oke\u2019s 1983 novel \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d into a series. Centered, at first, on a genteel schoolteacher, Elizabeth (Erin Krakow), a handsome Mountie (Daniel Lissing), and a local widow (Lori Loughlin) in a western-Canadian mining town circa 1910, it has a whiff of the piety of the \u201cLove Comes Softly\u201d series. When characters behave badly (covering up liability in a mine accident, putting on airs), they redeem themselves; pleasures are exceedingly gentle. The show\u2019s superfans, known as the Hearties, have an annual \u201cfamily reunion\u201d in Vancouver, and visit the set in tour buses. Some make social-media memes superimposing Bible passages over images from the show. \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d has some three million viewers an episode, competing for No. 1, on Sunday nights, with \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d about life in America after a zombie apocalypse. \u201cUntil we get to \u2018Walking Dead\u2019 numbers, I\u2019m not going to be happy,\u201d Abbott said. At the beginning of the series, Abigail, Loughlin\u2019s character, had lost her husband and son in a mining accident, but she persevered\u2014opening a caf\u00e9, adopting an orphan. By the time Abigail became the town\u2019s mayor, Loughlin was a cornerstone of Hallmark\u2014as Abbott told me, \u201ca very good friend, somebody who I admire a great deal for her skill,\u201d and \u201cat the top of the list in terms of people who were accessible, were kind, were committed to her fans, and were humble.\u201d On March 12th, Loughlin and her husband, along with Felicity Huffman and others, were indicted in a highly publicized college-admissions-fraud scheme, in which they allegedly paid five hundred thousand dollars to have their two daughters admitted under false pretenses. (Loughlin pleaded not guilty.) Two days later, Crown fired her; it pulled \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d off the air, midseason, and edited her out of its remaining episodes. When the show returned, Krakow, as Elizabeth, sat at a desk, writing in her diary. \u201cWe never know how life will turn,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week since Abigail got word that her mother had taken ill back East. True to her nature, Abigail wasted no time in rushing off to care for her.\u201d The townspeople would pray for her and her family. \u201cIn her absence, we must soldier on, and we will,\u201d Elizabeth continued. \u201cWe are a community. We are strong.\u201d In one of Abigail\u2019s final episodes, from February, she lovingly reassured Elizabeth, a new mother, about parenthood. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I know, a good mother always figures out what\u2019s best for her child,\u201d she said.", "In early November, Christmas Con brought together seventeen Hallmark-movie stars and several thousand regular Americans who wanted to meet them. The gathering, held at a modest convention center in Edison, New Jersey, had been organized by a small event company and sponsored by Hallmark, which had constructed a fully furnished living-room area, as if airlifted from the set of \u201cHome & Family,\u201d in the middle of the space. Guests in reindeer antlers and pro-Hallmark T-shirts drank mulled cider and posed inside a Christmas-ornament-shaped frame. The mood was exuberant. When a group of Hallmark actors, including Chad Michael Murray, emerged from the greenroom to pose in front of a tree, thousands cheered, a sea of arms raising cameras aloft. Male stars from Hunks of Hallmark, an Instagram fan account, gamely posed as attendees asked them to: holding their hands, looking into their eyes. One couple, Jeff and Kathy Martin, from New Jersey, were beaming; the actor Nikki DeLoach had just praised Jeff\u2019s Green Bay Packers Christmas sweater. I asked Kathy why she loved Hallmark. \u201cThe stress lifts right off!\u201d she told me, raising her arms in a gesture of unburdening. Later, Cheryl Longordo, a self-described \u201cHallmark-watching junkie,\u201d told me that it took her mind off her job at a pharmaceutical company. She and her sister, who wore a chemotherapy turban, were there together. \u201cYou need this,\u201d Longordo said, intensely. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline.\u201d \u201cI just wish this could have happened when I was wearing a sports bra.\u201d Cartoon by Sofia Warren Hallmark Channel fare has always struck a delicate balance between realism and something more idealized. A paradox of the channel is that the artificiality of its content, which offers predictable pleasures\u2014the \u201calmost kiss,\u201d interrupted by a ringing phone or a bleating goat; the ubiquitous baking contests\u2014is often delivered alongside surprisingly realistic performances. Unlike modern rom-coms, Hallmark plots\u2014which almost always feature romance, even alongside the murder investigations\u2014are driven not by arch concepts, high jinks, or panic about being single but by what Vicary described to me as \u201ca voyage of self-discovery.\u201d A long-standing trend of having Hallmark heroines tumbling off ladders into manly arms has been on the wane. As the writer Julie Sherman Wolfe told me, at Christmas Con, \u201cWe don\u2019t want our strong female leads to be damsels in distress.\u201d Characters fall in love because they see goodness in the other person, Vicary said\u2014often because of \u201ca kind act that causes the other character to take a look at themselves. Like what human beings go through. When something touches you, you can effect change.\u201d Some people dismiss Hallmark as presenting a fantasy, but, Ron Oliver said, its characters behave with greater maturity than many others onscreen. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing something in Hallmark-land, you have to understand that people tend to act like adults do,\u201d he said. Protagonists are often motivated by their goals as much as by love. The actor Anna Van Hooft specializes in playing \u201cHallmark villains\u201d\u2014a bride-to-be who buys a wedding dress that was on hold for someone else, a murderer. Even the villains \u201ctend to have their eyes on their goals\u201d\u2014but \u201cnot on the people around them,\u201d she said. For example, \u201cthe marriage, but not the man.\u201d In the heavier fare on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries and on Hallmark Drama, which began to air in 2017, violence and loss are explored within the same format that the Christmas movies use, with the same reliable happy-ever-afters. One film this year featured a subplot about medical debt. Another film, \u201cTwo Turtle Doves,\u201d by Sarah Montana, is a warmhearted love story between a grieving neuroscientist (Nikki DeLoach) and a widowed estate lawyer (Michael Rady). Their romance involves turtle-dove Christmas ornaments\u2014but also straightforward discussions about loss. At Christmas Con, DeLoach told me, \u201cSo many people have come up and told me it was a guide for learning to heal through grief.\u201d She was beaming. Hallmark\u2019s project of uplift has begun to extend not just into real lives but into real towns, many of which could use it. (A recurring theme of Hallmark movies is saving beloved local businesses.) For a special called \u201cProject Christmas Joy,\u201d Hallmark donated homes to families in tornado-ravaged parts of Alabama; it also threw a Christmas event for the residents of David City, Nebraska, the small home town of Joyce C. Hall. Despite its historic charm, my own home town, in Connecticut, has at times struggled to thrive. Last autumn, while looking at Instagram, I saw a startling post\u2014of my childhood house and the seed company my family had owned, next door, blanketed in fake snow. Hallmark was filming a Christmas movie there. Six weeks later, I watched the heroine of \u201cChristmas on Honeysuckle Lane\u201d enter a snowman contest outside the house and fall in love with an antique dealer, whose store was in the seed-company building. Inside, the stairs squeaked just the way I remembered."]}
