My 11-year-old self is wondering why on earth grownups want to hear the news on Christmas Day when there are vital things to be done, such as handing out presents. And then, while I am only half-listening, something weird happens: the Greenwich time pips start. Surely we have already heard those. And then the boring man with the plummy voice begins going on about a Christmas message to the world from the Vatican. Surely that\u2019s been on already, too.", "It\u2019s my older brother, Colin, who gets it! \u201cPete, Pete, it\u2019s a tape recorder, you idiot! We\u2019ve got our tape recorder.\u201d", "The penny drops: Uncle Tom and my dad have recorded the headlines, and are playing them back.", "I think it\u2019s often quite rare to experience real excitement over a present: in my experience, children are as good as adults at knowing what is expected of them and simulating joyful surprise, even when they don\u2019t feel it. But for me this was one of those rare moments when my insides gave an involuntary lurch and the world did a little somersault.", "Colin and I had both been blind from birth, and at this point were spending most of our time at a special boarding school, Worcester College for the Blind (now called New College Worcester). In the late 1950s, Britain had just reached the point when exciting consumer goods were coming within reach of the not-really-rich, and at Worcester reel-to-reel tape recorders were definitely the consumer gizmos of choice. For blind kids, they would trump cameras every time, especially at this moment when rock\u2019n\u2019roll was more of a religion than a pastime. For us, you could spot the better-off kids not by the clothes they wore, or the holidays they boasted about, but by the tape recorders they owned. So in our class, Iain Hopkin was marked out as something of a plutocrat by his Brenell recorder. Fortunately for us, Hoppy was a generous soul, and gave us all access to his recordings of Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers.", "Still, a recorder of your own was the height of aspiration, and Colin \u2013 better informed and more realistic about family finances than me \u2013 had no real expectations.", "I realised, much later, that at this time my dad, a very good joiner and carpenter, was probably earning about \u00a38 a week. The tape recorder my parents had bought us, although nowhere near at the top of the range, would have cost more than four times his weekly wage. My parents could only afford it by borrowing the money from Uncle Tom, who had a thriving grocery business. Family or not, I know my mum and dad would have thought long and hard before incurring the debt.", "The new toy, mains-powered and the size of a small suitcase, dominated the rest of Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays. Once we had mastered the controls (Colin was the technical one, but was surprisingly patient in sharing his discoveries with me), we recorded everything in sight: each other, our parents, the milkman, the dog \u2026 And we very quickly learned the fun to be had at catching people unawares.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Peter White aged about 8, with his older brother, Colin, aged about 12. Photograph: The White family", "Uncle Tom, at whose house we were staying over the holiday, got an early reward for his generous loan. Some friends he regarded as a little pretentious were coming over for Boxing Day; my aunt and uncle always referred to the husband as \u201cthe mayor of Romford\u201d. (Whether that was because he was or just talked as if he was, I\u2019m not sure I ever learned.) Uncle Tom was keen Bill should be made to listen to his chirpy cockney accent, which he claimed he didn\u2019t have. (Things like this mattered 60 years ago.) My task was to record them when they arrived and then at a quiet moment play it back to set Bill straight. Delighted to be trusted in this adult conspiracy of inverted snobbery, I set the machine going as they came up the path. The reaction was more than Uncle Tom could have hoped for; I think he decided at that point that his \u00a330-odd investment had already been more than repaid.", "It wasn\u2019t the first time I had been entranced by a tape recorder. I vividly remember, aged four, coming into a room and hearing a child singing, tunelessly, and raucously. I stopped dead. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Dad said. \u201cNoisy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. It turned out that he\u2019d borrowed a tape recorder because he and some friends were writing and performing songs and sketches for his former school\u2019s annual concert. And so for the first time, in the same way that a sighted child might react to seeing themselves in a mirror or a photograph, I got the sense of myself as a separate person, existing outside my head and experienced by other people. It was exciting and embarrassing \u2013 not a bad summing-up of my later life as a broadcaster.", "I really took my first steps down that path when I got back to school after the holidays ended. I was lucky to be in a class of imaginative and creative boys (yes, sadly, Worcester was single-sex then) and it wasn\u2019t long before \u2013 all of us radio-obsessed \u2013 we started to make our own embryo radio programmes. While studio managers at the BBC were still banging coconuts together to represent horses\u2019 hooves, we were using the little oblong pieces of lead we needed to represent numbers when doing sums to recreate shrapnel for our first world war battles. And very effective they were, dropped on to a desk from a great height.", "Meanwhile, I would wander round the school with my rudimentary microphone, commenting in the voices of my radio idols \u2013 the hushed, reverential tones of Richard Dimbleby, the gravel-voiced war correspondent Ren\u00e9 Cutforth, and, favourite of all, the mellow Hampshire burr of John Arlott.", "Most of what I described was pure imagination, although occasionally we would stage real events to heighten the excitement. Particularly memorable was a boxing match between Mick and Geoff (respectively the strongest and the gamest boys in the class, both totally blind. The commentary came from the only one of us with a little bit of sight, in a very passable imitation of the boxing commentator Raymond Glendenning). The strong boy beat the game boy, by the way.", "The acquisition of the tape recorder coincided with the formation of our own band: Reg Webb, Andy Woods and \u2013 yes \u2013 Peter White, imaginatively called the W Brothers and destined to be the greatest group ever, had not the Beatles come along and pinched our best material. Reg and Andy were good musicians, and went on to have professional careers. I wasn\u2019t in their musical class, but made up for it with what I thought at the time was my witty banter to introduce our songs. At one of our concerts a girl actually screamed \u2013 although it could have been that someone trod on her foot.", "In fact, the biggest challenge was not finding things to do with the tape recorder but wrestling it away from Colin \u2013 it was, after all, a joint present. His generosity on the first day we got it did not extend to his handing it over to his ham-fisted brother at school. I can still hear the phrases: \u201cYou\u2019ll break it; you\u2019ll lose it; you\u2019ll scramble up all the tapes.\u201d And, annoyingly, I did do all of those things. On one fraught occasion, trying in front of an open window to disentangle the hopelessly knotted tape that contained my latest radio gem, I managed to get yards of the stuff enmeshed in an overhanging tree.", "But 10 years later, by which time I had begun and abandoned a university law course, it was the confidence gained from those early excursions into sound that had me walking into the local radio station in Southampton, trying to sell myself as the next Robin Day. It all nearly ended there, as the receptionist told me there were no vacancies, and that I\u2019d have to apply to the BBC in London \u201cthrough the normal channels\u201d.", "Luck intervened. A producer charged with putting together a weekly programme for blind people saw me and my white cane being ushered into the lift. As I prepared to hitchhike my disillusioned way back to university, he rang me at home, and asked if I would go back to Southampton to see him.", "Twenty-five years after that, I presented my first report for BBC TV\u2019s Six O\u2019Clock News, a date with the telly my dad had never missed. Although by then he\u2019d been dead for more than a decade, I like to think he\u2019d have realised that his inspired Christmas present really had not just changed, but shaped my life.", "Peter White is the BBC\u2019s disability affairs correspondent"], "authors": ["Peter White"], "keywords": ["tape", "paid", "tom", "colin", "wage", "times", "blind", "uncle", "recorder", "father", "white", "life", "dad", "weekly", "day", "greatest", "christmas", "gift"]}
