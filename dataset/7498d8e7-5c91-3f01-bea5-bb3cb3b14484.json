Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP", "1) \u2018More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.\u2019", "Fourteen women and five men were hung in colonial Massachusetts the late 1690s, for supposedly engaging in witchcraft. \u201cSpectral evidence\u201d was admissible in the trials \u2013 evidence where a witness had a dream, or apparition, which featured the alleged witch engaged in dark deeds. Spectral evidence is yet to feature in Trump\u2019s impeachment hearings.", "2) \u2018You [Nancy Pelosi] are offending Americans of faith by continually saying: \u201cI pray for the president,\u201d when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!\u2019", "Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said she prays for Donald Trump. In October, the House speaker said she was praying for his \u201chealth\u201d, after Trump had what she described as a \u201cmeltdown\u201d during a meeting with Democratic leaders. It\u2019s not the first time she has claimed to be appealing to a higher power on Trump\u2019s behalf. It seems Trump doesn\u2019t like it. Or believe it.", "3) \u2018There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens.\u2019", "Trump\u2019s claims that he alone could withstand such rough treatment from his opponents rather fall down here \u2013 located as they are in a six-page ode to self-pity.", "4) \u2018You view democracy as your enemy!\u2019", "This exclamation comes midway through the letter, after Trump claims the Democrats have developed \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d. Trump is not confident of the odds Democrats will recover from the malady: \u201cYou will never get over it!\u201d he writes.", "5) \u2018I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record. 100 years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another president again.\u2019", "There\u2019s a slightly self-satisfied air to the final paragraph of the letter, as if Trump feels he has delivered a piece of soaring oratory which will be pored over by scholars in years to come. At least here, in a sense, Trump is correct. People are unlikely to forget \u201cthis affair\u201d \u2013 his presidency \u2013 for a long, long time and historians of the future will certainly examine this letter: just perhaps not in the way Trump would want them to."], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["highlights", "letter", "claims", "witchcraft", "nancy", "trump", "bizarre", "angry", "evidence", "twitter", "worse", "accused", "trumps", "pelosi", "witch"], "id": "7498d8e7-5c91-3f01-bea5-bb3cb3b14484", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "title": "Five highlights from Trump's angry, bizarre letter to Nancy Pelosi"}
