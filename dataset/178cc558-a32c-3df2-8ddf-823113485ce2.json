A year earlier, in January 2018, Zegler\u2019s friend Makena Reynolds had shared a casting-call tweet along with a \u201cThank me when you\u2019re famous\u201d quip.

The movie\u2019s December 2020 release was pushed back a full year in hopes of a post-\u00adpandemic cinema debut, leaving Zegler, who wrapped production months ago, to take up some of the same lockdown pastimes as the rest of us: roller-skating, guitar-playing. Zegler, who was raised in Clifton, New Jersey, spent her youth traveling into Manhattan for Broadway shows, and so she\u2019s also been consuming as much virtually accessible culture as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible reality, not being able to have live theater,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I really enjoy watching the way entertainment is adapting.\u201d She\u2019s also spending time with her Colombian-American family, which is immeasurably proud of her. In Zegler\u2019s portrayal of Maria (opposite heartthrob Ansel Elgort as Tony), not only is she realizing her own Hollywood dreams but she\u2019s a Latina playing a Puerto Rican migrant\u2014a role famously whitewashed by an artificially bronzed Natalie Wood in the 1961 film adaption. Throughout our conversation, she carefully articulates: It\u2019s \u201cMah-riya,\u201d not the Anglo \u201cMuh-riya.\u201d", "", "For Zegler, the film serves as \u201ca beautiful display of Latin joy and the way that young Latin girls deserve to see themselves\u2014dancing around in pretty dresses and singing about loving themselves. It\u2019s something that\u2019s mattered so much to me, being Latina\u2014singing \u2018I Feel Pretty\u2019 and meaning it. I hope that young people everywhere will know that their features are gorgeous and their culture is beautiful. I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s meant to my family,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Another surety? Makena absolutely deserves a thank-you."], "authors": ["Lilah Ramzi", "Lilah Ramz", "Stefan Rui", "Tonne Goodma"], "keywords": ["thats", "rachel", "zegler", "2021s", "way", "zeglers", "film", "deliver", "know", "maria", "west", "pretty", "shes", "moment", "young"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
