She joined the Alpha chapter at Howard during her senior year, one of a handful of students who were accepted into the organization at the time. The women would become lifelong friends, supporting Harris on her campaign trail. Her time as an AKA had a profound impact, one she explored in her autobiography, The Truths We Hold. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just told we had the capacity to be great; we were challenged to live up to that potential,\u201d Harris wrote of her university experience. \u201cThere was an expectation that we would cultivate and use our talents to take on roles in leadership and have an impact on other people, in our country, and maybe even the world.\u201d", "When conceptualizing the cover, Mitchell wanted to honor Harris\u2019s college days and the powerful women who comprise the ranks of sororities like Alpha Kappa Alpha. The son of a Delta Sigma Theta (the second of the three historically Black sororities founded at Howard) and nephew of an AKA, he appreciated both organizations\u2019 cultural importance. \u201cI grew up from a young age deeply understanding the rich history of these sororities and their significance,\u201d shared Mitchell via email. \u201cWith this cover shoot with Madam Vice President-Elect Harris, I wanted the set design to pay homage to that history, to her status as an AKA, and Black sororities and sisterhoods worldwide.\u201d", "Set designer Julia Wagner gave Harris a serene backdrop of flowing pastel fabric with salmon tone satin and apple green brocade. With Harris in the Converse sneakers that have become her trademark and a blazer designed by her friend, designer Donald Deal, the image captures Harris, the groundbreaking politician, while alluding to the path that led her to the White House. More than inspiring her political journey, Harris\u2019s sisters and the entirety of the Divine Nine fraternities and sororities who comprise the National Pan-Hellenic Council, strolled to the polls to vote for her, creating a memorable viral moment in the process. For Mitchell, that kind of solidarity and strength in numbers is what it\u2019s truly all about. \u201cTo me, their colors conjure images of Black women standing together,\u201d he says. \u201c[United] in sisterhood throughout time, affirming one another.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["alpha", "sororities", "women", "mitchell", "wanted", "vogue", "sorority", "harriss", "days", "cover", "aka", "tribute", "black", "harris", "impact", "kamala"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
