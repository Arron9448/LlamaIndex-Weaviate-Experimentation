It is clear, however, that the cumulative effect is negative\u2014and not just for the offending company\u2019s reputation or stock price. Each transgression causes society to be more cynical and less trusting.", "On the other hand, companies that operate with intentional integrity and accountability can gain a competitive edge.", "What is intentional integrity?", "", "First, we need to define \u201cintegrity.\u201d", "According to Rob Chesnut, former chief ethics officer at Airbnb and author of \u201cIntentional Integrity: How Smart Companies Can Lead an Ethical Revolution,\u201d when you have integrity it means that you\u2019ll do the right thing even when no one is watching. \u201cThe problem is that, today, someone is always watching\u2014and they're quick to call you out if you're not acting in accordance with their values.\u201d", "And in this type of environment, Chesnut says it\u2019s important for companies to clearly understand their purpose. \u201cWhy does your company exist, and why is the company\u2019s existence good for the world?\u201d That purpose serves as the overarching principle. \u201cAnd then, companies need to define, with intentionality, how they're going to act, who their stakeholders are, and how they're going to operate to the benefit of those stakeholders.\u201d Chesnut believes that this type of purposeful exercise can drive integrity throughout the culture of an organisation.", "Why it\u2019s so important for a company to have integrity", "", "Integrity isn\u2019t a nice-to-have; it\u2019s a must-have. It can help your company build its brand\u2014and outlast your competitors. Conversely, the lack of integrity can destroy your reputation and your organisation.", "\u201cFor starters, employees want to work at companies that operate with clear values that align with their own,\u201d Chesnut explains. And if they don\u2019t think the company is living up to their expectations, he says the internet provides a global platform to talk about the organisation\u2019s shortcomings.", "\u201cAlso, employees are tweeting, posting on Blind and Glassdoor, and communicating with each other through Slack,\u201d Chesnut says. \u201cThey\u2019re speaking out and walking out\u2014and [it\u2019s] not just employees.\u201d Consumers also want to support an organisation that shares their values. \u201cIf they don\u2019t like a company\u2019s track record on the environment or social issues, the information is all right there for them online, and they\u2019re voting with their dollars,\u201d Chesnut says.", "He explains that integrity done right can be a superpower. \u201cIt can energise and inspire your employees, and it can drive your business as well.\u201d Chesnut points to a recent global study that found consumers are four to six times more likely to purchase from a company if they believe it has an admirable purpose. They\u2019re also more likely to protect and champion that organisation.", "Dr Vince Molinaro, founder and CEO of Leadership Contract in Ontario, Canada, and author of \u201cAccountable Leaders: Inspire a Culture Where Everyone Steps Up, Takes Ownership, and Delivers Results,\u201d believes that integrity is the currency of an organisation.", "\u201cCompanies with high integrity experience many tangible and intangible benefits: increased employee engagement and retention, attracting the best talent, customers who are fans, and respect from the market and competitors.\u201d", "And this is one area in which leaders have to take the lead. Molinaro says CEOs are also expected to behave with integrity.", "Identifying integrity issues", "", "People tend to think of integrity in terms of stealing money from the company or its clients. But that\u2019s just one type of integrity issue. Chesnut says it goes back to the company\u2019s purpose and how it operates. \u201cThere are companies that have no real purpose other than to make money for the investors,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey focus almost exclusively on things like revenue, profit and share price, and they often don\u2019t focus on the collateral effects of the business\u2014things like their impact on the environment, workers and the communities where they operate.\u201d", "Molinaro agrees, and provides five key areas in which a company can judge its level of integrity:", "Living the company\u2019s values Practising what the company preaches to customers: do what you say you will do Honouring commitments made Treating employees, customers, supply chain partners and other key stakeholders (including the community and the environment) with respect and dignity Admitting, owning up to and accepting accountability when mistakes have been made and integrity has been undermined", "It\u2019s important to emphasise the internal side of integrity. Companies can look like exemplary organisations from the outside, but what\u2019s happening behind the scenes can cause the company to implode.", "Ensuring your organisation operates with intentional integrity and accountability", "", "Operating with integrity is one of the very few organisational initiatives that doesn\u2019t require a budget and won\u2019t cost you a dime. Chesnut advises, however, that \u201cit takes a consistent, determined effort that has to start with the CEO.\u201d If leadership buys in and truly starts acting with integrity and having conversations with their team around this topic, he says it\u2019s contagious, as everyone else will take their cues from their managers.", "Since leaders are so crucial to the organisation\u2019s success in this area, they have to be held accountable. \u201cSo the board must hold the CEO accountable, the CEO must hold the senior management team accountable, and the CHRO needs to ensure there are mechanisms in place to hold leaders and managers accountable,\u201d Molinaro says. Part of this includes making it safe to report leaders who don\u2019t behave with integrity\u2014which means whistleblowers won\u2019t be ostracised or retaliated against. And this may require drastic steps. \u201cYou must demonstrate zero tolerance for serious violations of integrity by addressing, terminating and exiting leaders who behave badly,\u201d he says.", "Once the organisation sees that the leadership team is committed to integrity, and that actions speak as loud as words, you\u2019re ready to take the next step. \u201cNow, you can put in place a regular cadence of programmes, communications and education efforts within the company to keep integrity top of mind,\u201d Chesnut says. \u201cThe best defence is authentic, direct communication about important issues related to doing the right thing, since integrity is often lost where there is silence or ambiguity.\u201d", "Browse leadership courses for executives", "--", "Terri Williams is a freelance writer who covers leadership topics for The Economist Careers Network."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["brand", "theyre", "accountability", "companies", "company", "building", "integrity", "leaders", "employees", "companys", "chesnut", "intentional", "purpose", "leadership"], "pubDate": "2021-04-09T12:22:37Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
