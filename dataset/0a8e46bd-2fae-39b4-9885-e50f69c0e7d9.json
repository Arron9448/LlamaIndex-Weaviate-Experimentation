Tiffany &Co. bracelet. Jimmy Choo shoes. Hair, Tokyo Stylez; makeup, Hannah Murray. Fashion Editor: Tonne Goodman. Photographed by Annie Leibovitz, Vogue, January 2020", "ALTHOUGH CARDI B COULD NEVER BE ACCUSED OF MINCING WORDS, it\u2019s hard to imagine a Twitter rant as frank on the subject of fame and its discontents as her video for \u201cPress,\u201d the tense, defiant track she released in the spring of this year. In it, a steamy m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois culminates in a gunshot, which in turn gives way to a defiantly glamorous perp walk, a police interrogation complicated by very high heels, a trial that ends in a bloodbath, and, for good measure, a prison-cell toilet-bowl drowning. \u201cPress, press, press, press, press / Cardi don\u2019t need more press,\u201d she raps over a frantic beat. \u201cWalk in, bulletproof vest. . . . Murder scene, Cardi made a mess.\u201d She\u2019s the antihero of this ambivalent revenge fantasy; as the bodies pile up, her tearful fans begin to look foolish, and the haters\u2014the press, presumably?\u2014are proven right.", "The video was released a day after Cardi B pleaded not guilty to charges emanating from a brawl at the Angels NYC gentlemen\u2019s club in Queens the previous August. If there was a point to the timing, perhaps it was to assert that Cardi was already on trial. \u201cI thought \u2018Press\u2019 was fun and it was gangsta, and then because it didn\u2019t perform as good as my other songs, people was like, Oh, she\u2019s a flop; oh, she\u2019s dying out,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis whole year has just been a lot for me. I feel like people are just so tired of me winning. I will look for my name on Twitter, and it\u2019s like hate tweets, hate tweets, hate tweets.\u201d", "It\u2019s the middle of an early-autumn afternoon, and Cardi is stretched out on the green modular sofa in the living room of her grandmother\u2019s apartment in Washington Heights. She has just woken up, having come home at close to 3 a.m. after shooting a video with the rapper Fat Joe for his track \u201cYes,\u201d on which she guests. The song is a paean to a certain rough New York\u2014perhaps the Bronx, where both Fat Joe and Cardi grew up\u2014fueled by violence and greed. (\u201cMy palm and my trigger finger itch, bitch,\u201d Cardi raps.) She is wearing nothing but an oversize white T-shirt and underpants, a reprieve from the daily slog of hair and nails and zippers and heels. A giant peacock tattoo stretches over her buttock and down around her thigh. Lately her style has hewed toward the quiet and refined. She loves suits, in part because she loves the idea of surprising people by wearing suits. But for the video, she wanted to deliver early-aughts J. Lo vibes: white fur coat, white fur Tarzan miniskirt, white bikini top. A white Yankees cap was rejected, since she is a Red Sox fan. (\u201cThe underdog thing,\u201d she explains.) Only her long, silver Targaryen wig remains from last night\u2019s costuming.", "Cardi was born at NewYork-Presbyterian, not far from this walkup whose hallways are saturated with the warm smells of Dominican cooking. Her father\u2019s mother has lived here for 34 years, and it\u2019s the longtime family gathering place. She has 10 aunts and uncles on her father\u2019s side alone, and 36 cousins, and she can remember so many nights when these narrow floors were crowded with sleeping bodies. Neighbors in the building, who have known her since she was a baby, barely seem to register her fame. The clamor itself feels protective: Her own apartment, in New Jersey, is spacious and quiet, an incubator for worry. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there by myself, a lot of thoughts go to my head, and when the thoughts go to my head, it just overwhelms me, and it puts me down, and it puts me on social media, and that drives me insane. So I just like to be where there\u2019s a lot of people so I won\u2019t be watching my phone.\u201d At this point her 16-month-old daughter, Kulture, grinning widely, walks through after her bath, accompanied by Cardi\u2019s aunt and her niece. Cardi squeals and gives her baby a hug, and the trio disappear behind a curtain that divides the living room from the sleeping areas. \u201cBeing a mom\u2014how can I say it? Things are a little bit harder to balance, but it\u2019s good for the mental. Like, if I\u2019m playing with my daughter, I forget about the issues.\u201d"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-cover-january-2020", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["hate", "walk", "lot", "b", "white", "video", "cardi", "wearing", "press", "unapologetic", "good", "shes", "unbowed", "unfiltered"], "id": "0a8e46bd-2fae-39b4-9885-e50f69c0e7d9", "title": "Cardi B: Unfiltered, Unapologetic, Unbowed", "summary": "\u201cPress, press, press, press, press / Cardi don\u2019t need more press,\u201d she raps over a frantic beat.\nThe video was released a day after Cardi B pleaded not guilty to charges emanating from a brawl at the Angels NYC gentlemen\u2019s club in Queens the previous August.\nIf there was a point to the timing, perhaps it was to assert that Cardi was already on trial.\nCardi was born at NewYork-Presbyterian, not far from this walkup whose hallways are saturated with the warm smells of Dominican cooking.\nCardi squeals and gives her baby a hug, and the trio disappear behind a curtain that divides the living room from the sleeping areas.", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rob Haskel", "Annie Leibovit"]}
