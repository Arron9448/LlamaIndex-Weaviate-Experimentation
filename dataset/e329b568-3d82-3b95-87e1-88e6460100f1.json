Consider the past decade\u2019s screenplay winners, which include such happy oddities as Spike Jonze\u2019s \u201cHer,\u201d in which a man falls in love with an operating system; Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out,\u201d a satire-horror film that exposes the racism lurking beneath liberal politesse; and Taika Waititi\u2019s \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d a deadpan comedy about an adorable Nazi-in-training. For each film, it was the sole award, as if committing these harebrained ideas to a laptop were achievement enough. Or, look back a few decades earlier, to the ceremony of 1942, when John Ford\u2019s wistful portrait of Welsh village life, \u201cHow Green Was My Valley,\u201d won the top prize, while the jaundiced and jigsaw-like \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d managed to win its one and only Oscar for its screenplay.", "This year, the tangled story behind that screenplay and its uneasy collaborators, Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz, is the subject of \u201cMank,\u201d itself nominated for ten Oscars, the most of any film this season. Notably, the writing categories are among the few in which this ode to an undersung screenwriter doesn\u2019t appear, despite the fact that it was written by Jack Fincher, who died in 2003, and directed by his son, David, as a kind of filial offering. Oh, well. Not every poignant made-for-awards-season backstory gets results, and the ten movies that are nominated contain plenty of ingenuity. Take the Best Adapted Screenplay contenders, which draw on sources ranging from a French play and a nonfiction study of America\u2019s transient seniors to a pre\u00ebxisting character who may be Kazakhstan\u2019s most famous son, despite being entirely fictional. Here\u2019s a closer look at both of this year\u2019s writing categories.", "BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY", "\u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\u201d", "There are nine\u2014nine!\u2014writers credited for this moviefilm, and none of them is named Rudy Giuliani. Eight wrote the screenplay, and an overlapping group of four has story credit. Instead of a nineteenth-century novel or a Broadway play, the screenplay is based on a character who first appeared on a British sketch show in the nineties and is known for his anti-Semitism and public defecation. Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s semi-improvised satires belong to a writing category all their own, since they depend on the unwitting contributions of his real-world marks. None of this fazed the Writers Guild, which awarded this gaggle of pranksters its adapted-screenplay prize in March. And why not? It takes a sui-generis sort of mastery to build a series of outrageous provocations into a damning portrait of American ugliness.", "\u201cThe Father\u201d", "Photograph by Sean Gleason / Courtesy Sony Pictures", "The French writer Florian Zeller made his reputation as a literary enfant terrible, publishing his first novel, \u201cArtificial Snow,\u201d when he was twenty-two, but it was his 2012 play, \u201cLe P\u00e8re,\u201d that brought him international notoriety. Christopher Hampton\u2019s English translation played on London\u2019s West End and on Broadway, where it won a 2016 Tony Award for Frank Langella. I wish I\u2019d seen it then, because the movie version\u2014Zeller\u2019s film-directing d\u00e9but\u2014is so packed with structural surprise that it seems endemic to the screen. The film is a maze that places us inside the disintegrating mind of Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), a belligerent old man with advanced dementia. Countless films about one ailment or another follow a familiar, heart-tugging pattern, and you may have assumed that \u201cThe Father\u201d is one of them. But it isn\u2019t. Zeller\u2019s screenplay has the cunning of a sleight-of-hand trick, disorienting us along with its title character\u2014a technique that only deepens the impact of its emotional wallops.", "\u201cNomadland\u201d", "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao spun her portrait of a restless soul in the late-capitalist wilderness from Jessica Bruder\u2019s 2017 nonfiction book of the same name, subtitled \u201cSurviving America in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d The book profiled a range of American seniors who set out, post-recession, to crisscross the country in vans and mobile homes finding seasonal work at Amazon fulfillment centers, raspberry fields, and oil rigs. Some of Bruder\u2019s subjects play themselves in the film, but it centers on a fictional sixty-something, Fern (Frances McDormand), whose town of Empire, Nevada, all but evaporates after the closure of a United States Gypsum plant. Zhao\u2019s screenplay shows how elastic the act of adaptation can be, distilling a panorama of true stories into an invented one that feels just as lived-in and idiosyncratic as the rest.", "\u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d", "Long before the credits rolled on Regina King\u2019s civil-rights drama, I had an inkling that I\u2019d see the words \u201cbased on the stage play.\u201d Kemp Powers adapted his own play, which premi\u00e8red at Los Angeles\u2019s Rogue Machine Theatre, in 2013, and imagines a real night from 1964 that brought together four Black icons: the soul singer Sam Cooke, the activist Malcolm X, the running back Jim Brown, and the boxing champion Cassius Clay, soon to become Muhammad Ali. The script is bursting with timely, dialectical arguments about political engagement and Black identity, but it reminded me of other plays I\u2019ve seen that tease out the meetings of notable minds, often played out as a battle of ideas\u2014a genre that can bend toward talky, self-important, and pat. Powers\u2019s script doesn\u2019t escape these pitfalls (and its treatment of Cooke had drawn scrutiny), though it\u2019s buoyed by crackling performances.", "\u201cThe White Tiger\u201d", "Photograph by Tejinder Singh Khamkha / Courtesy Netflix", "The sole nomination for this funny, haunting, irrepressible film is for the director Ramin Bahrani\u2019s screenplay, based on Aravind Adiga\u2019s 2008 novel, which won the Man Booker Prize. You can sense the novel pulsing beneath the action, propelled by the chatty, eager voice of its main character, Balram, a low-born Indian striver who talks his way into a job chauffeuring a rich entrepreneur and reinvents himself as the owner of a taxi service\u2014with a few bloody twists. \u201cThe White Tiger\u201d echoes last year\u2019s big Oscar winner, \u201cParasite,\u201d in its view of the perils and the indignities of the class divide. But, where \u201cParasite\u201d was steely and stoic, \u201cThe White Tiger\u201d zips along like a sugar high, covering a vast narrative ground while still immersing us in the claustrophobia of the caste system.", "Bottom line: Although \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\u201d won the W.G.A.\u2019s award, that victory isn\u2019t necessarily predictive. \u201cNomadland\u201d and \u201cThe Father\u201d were ineligible, since they weren\u2019t written under a Writers Guild contract. \u201cNomadland\u201d is the front-runner for Best Picture and most likely here, too, in part thanks to its unconventional source material. A \u201cNomadland\u201d loss might signal a dampening of its over-all momentum, or perhaps a desire not to let \u201cThe Father\u201d or Baron Cohen (who is nominated for an acting award for \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d) go empty-handed. As for \u201cThe White Tiger,\u201d let its nomination serve as a reminder to seek it out on Netflix.", "BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY", "\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d"], "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Michael Schulma", "Richard Brod", "Alex Ros"], "keywords": ["screenplay", "best", "writing", "award", "prize", "tiger", "film", "white", "won", "novel", "screenplays", "play", "oscars", "nominees", "spotlight", "2021"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
