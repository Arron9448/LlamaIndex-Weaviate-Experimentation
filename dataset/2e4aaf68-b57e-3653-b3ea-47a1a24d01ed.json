Such activities were mostly performed at open-air sites, rockshelters, or cave entrances,\" reads the study.", "\"While depictions were not created solely in the deep and dark parts of the caves, images at such locations are a very impressive aspect of cave depictions and are thus the focus of this study.\"", "Using fire to light the caves would have reduced oxygen levels and led to a state of hypoxia, which releases dopamine and can lead to hallucinations and out-of-body experiences, Ran Barkai, co-author and professor of prehistoric archaeology, told CNN.", "Bison depicted at the Covaciella cave, Spain.
