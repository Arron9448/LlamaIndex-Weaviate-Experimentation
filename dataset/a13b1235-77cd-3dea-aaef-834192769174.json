{"pubDate": null, "title": "What Is Remembered", "paragraphs": ["In a hotel room in Vancouver, Meriel as a young woman is putting on her short white summer gloves. She wears a beige linen dress and a flimsy white scarf over her hair. Dark hair, at that time. She smiles, because she has remembered something that Queen Sirikit of Thailand said, or was quoted as saying, in a magazine. A quote within a quote\u2014something Queen Sirikit said that Balmain had said. \u201cBalmain taught me everything. He said, \u2018Always wear white gloves. It\u2019s best.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s best. Meriel smiles at that, not as you\u2019d smile at a joke but as at an endearing absurdity. Her gloved hands look formal but helpless. A kitten\u2019s paws. Pierre asks why she\u2019s smiling, and she says, \u201cNothing,\u201d then tells him. He says, \u201cWho is Balmain?\u201d", "They were getting ready to go to a funeral. They had come over on the ferry last night, from their home on Vancouver Island, to be sure of being on time for the morning ceremony. It was the first time they\u2019d stayed in a hotel since their wedding night. When they went on a holiday now, it was always with their two children, and they looked for inexpensive motels that catered to families. This was only the second funeral they had been to as a married couple. Pierre\u2019s father was dead, and Meriel\u2019s mother was dead, but these deaths had happened before Pierre and Meriel met. Last year, a teacher at Pierre\u2019s school died suddenly, and there was a fine service, with the schoolboy choir and the sixteenth-century words for the Burial of the Dead. The man had been in his mid-sixties, and his death seemed to Meriel and Pierre only a little surprising and hardly sad. It did not make much difference, as they saw it, whether you died at sixty-five or seventy-five or eighty-five. The funeral today was another matter. It was Jonas who was being buried. Pierre\u2019s best friend for years and Pierre\u2019s age\u2014twenty-nine. They had grown up together, in West Vancouver\u2014they could remember it before the Lions Gate Bridge was built, when it seemed like a small town. Their parents were friends. When the boys were eleven or twelve years old they had built a rowboat and launched it at Dundarave Pier. At the university, they had parted company for a while\u2014Jonas was studying to be an engineer, while Pierre was enrolled in classics, and the arts students and the engineering students traditionally despised each other. But, in the years since then, the friendship had to some extent been revived. Jonas, who was not married, had come to visit Pierre and Meriel, and sometimes stayed with them for a week at a time. What had happened in their lives surprised them, and they would joke about it. Jonas was the one whose choice of profession had seemed so reassuring to his parents, and had roused a muted envy in Pierre\u2019s parents, yet it was Pierre who had married and got a teaching job and taken on ordinary responsibilities, while Jonas, after university, had never settled down with a girl or a job. He was always on some sort of probation that did not end up in a firm attachment to any company, and the girls\u2014at least to hear him tell it\u2014were always on some sort of probation with him. His last engineering job was in the northern part of the province, and he stayed on there after either quitting or getting fired. Employment terminated by mutual consent, he wrote to Pierre, adding that he was living at the hotel, where all the high-class people lived, and might get a job on a logging crew. He was also learning to fly a plane, and thinking of becoming a bush pilot. He promised to visit when present financial complications were worked out. Meriel had hoped that wouldn\u2019t happen. Jonas slept on the living-room couch and in the morning threw the covers on the floor for her to pick up. He kept Pierre awake half the night, talking about things that had happened when they were teen-agers, or even younger. His name for Pierre was \u201cPiss-hair,\u201d a nickname from those years, and he referred to other old friends as Stinkpool and Doc and Buster, never by the names Meriel had always heard\u2014Stan and Don and Rick. He recalled with a gruff pedantry the details of incidents that Meriel did not think so remarkable or funny (the bag of dog shit set on fire on the teacher\u2019s front steps, the badgering of the old man who offered boys a nickel to pull down their pants) and grew irritated if the conversation turned to the present. When she had to tell Pierre that Jonas was dead she was apologetic, shaken. Apologetic because she hadn\u2019t liked him and shaken because he was the first person they knew well, in their own age group, to have died. But Pierre did not seem to be surprised or particularly stricken. \u201cSuicide,\u201d he said. She said no, an accident. He was riding a motorcycle, after dark, on gravel, and he went off the road. Somebody found him, or was with him, help was at hand, but he died within an hour. His injuries were mortal. That was what his mother had said, on the phone. She had sounded so quickly resigned, so unsurprised. As Pierre had when he said \u201cSuicide.\u201d After that, Pierre and Meriel had hardly spoken about the death itself, just about the funeral, the hotel room, the need for an all-night sitter. His suit to be cleaned, a white shirt obtained. It was Meriel who made the arrangements, and Pierre kept checking up on her in an irritable, husbandly way. She understood that he wished her to be controlled and matter-of-fact, as he was, and not to lay claim to any sorrow that\u2014he would be sure\u2014she could not really feel. She had asked him why he had said \u201cSuicide,\u201d and he had told her, \u201cThat\u2019s just what came into my head.\u201d She felt his evasion to be some sort of warning, or even a rebuke. As if he suspected her of deriving from this death\u2014or from their proximity to this death\u2014a feeling that was discreditable and self-centered. A morbid, preening excitement. Young husbands were stern, in those days. Just a short time before, they had been suitors, almost figures of fun, knock-kneed and desperate in their sexual agonies. Now, bedded down, they turned resolute and disapproving. Off to work every morning, clean shaven, youthful necks in knotted ties, days spent in unknown labors, home again at suppertime to take a critical glance at the evening meal and to shake out the newspaper, hold it up between themselves and the muddle of the kitchen, the ailments and emotions, the babies. What a lot they had to learn, so quickly. How to kowtow to bosses and how to manage wives. How to be authoritative about mortgages, retaining walls, lawn grass, drains, politics, as well as about the jobs that would have to maintain their families for the next quarter of a century. It was the women, then, who could slip back\u2014during the daytime hours, and always allowing for the stunning responsibility that had been landed on them, in the matter of the children\u2014into a kind of second adolescence. A lightening of spirits when the husbands departed. Dreamy rebellion, subversive get-togethers, laughing fits that were a throwback to high school, mushrooming between the walls that the husband was paying for, in the hours when he wasn\u2019t there.", "After the funeral, some people had been invited back to Jonas\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Dundarave. The rhododendron hedge was in bloom, all red and pink and purple. Jonas\u2019s father was complimented on the garden. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to get it in shape in a bit of a hurry.\u201d Jonas\u2019s mother said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a real lunch, I\u2019m afraid. Just a pickup.\u201d Most people were drinking sherry, though some of the men had whiskey. Food was set out on the extended dining-room table\u2014salmon mousse and crackers, mushroom tarts, sausage rolls, a light lemon cake and cut-up fruit and pressed-almond cookies, as well as shrimp and ham and cucumber-and-avocado sandwiches. Pierre heaped everything onto his small china plate and Meriel heard his mother say to him, \u201cYou know, you could always come back for a second helping.\u201d She didn\u2019t live in West Vancouver anymore but had come in from White Rock for the funeral. And she wasn\u2019t quite confident about a direct reprimand, now that Pierre was a teacher and a married man. \u201cOr didn\u2019t you think there\u2019d be any left?\u201d she said. Pierre said carelessly, \u201cMaybe not of what I wanted.\u201d His mother spoke to Meriel. \u201cWhat a nice dress.\u201d \u201cYes, but look,\u201d said Meriel, smoothing down the wrinkles that had formed while she sat through the service. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble,\u201d Pierre\u2019s mother said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d said Jonas\u2019s mother brightly, sliding some tarts onto the warming dish. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with linen,\u201d said Pierre\u2019s mother. \u201cMeriel was just saying how her dress had wrinkled up\u201d\u2014she did not say, \u201cduring the funeral service\u201d\u2014\u201cand I was saying, that\u2019s the trouble with linen.\u201d Jonas\u2019s mother might not have been listening. Looking across the room, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the doctor who looked after him. He flew down from Smithers in his own plane. Really, we thought that was so good of him.\u201d Pierre\u2019s mother said, \u201cThat\u2019s quite an undertaking.\u201d \u201cYes. Well. I suppose he gets around that way, to attend to people in the bush.\u201d The man they were talking about was speaking to Pierre. He was not wearing a suit, though he had a decent jacket on, and a shirt and tie. \u201cI suppose he would,\u201d said Pierre\u2019s mother, and Jonas\u2019s mother said, \u201cYes,\u201d and Meriel felt as if something had been settled between them. She looked down at the table napkins, which were folded in quarters. They were not as big as dinner napkins or as small as cocktail napkins. They were set in overlapping rows, so that a corner of each napkin (the corner embroidered with a tiny blue or pink or yellow flower) overlapped the folded corner of its neighbor. No two napkins embroidered with the same color of flower were touching each other. Nobody had disturbed them, or if they had\u2014for she did see a few people around the room holding napkins\u2014they had picked up napkins from the end of the row in a careful way, and this order had been maintained. At the funeral service, the minister had compared Jonas\u2019s life on earth to the life of a baby in the womb. The baby, he said, knows nothing of any other existence and inhabits its warm, dark, watery cave with not an inkling of the great, bright world it will soon be thrust into. And we on earth have an inkling, but are really quite unable to imagine the light that we will enter, after we have survived the travail of death. If the baby could somehow be informed of what would happen to it in the near future, would it not be incredulous as well as afraid? And so are we, most of the time, but we should not be, for we have been given assurance. Even so, our blind brains cannot imagine, cannot conceive of, what we will pass into. The baby is lapped in its ignorance, in the faith of its dumb, helpless being. And we who are not entirely ignorant or entirely knowing must take care to wrap ourselves in our faith, in the word of our Lord. Meriel looked at the minister, who stood in the hall doorway with a glass of sherry in his hand, listening to a vivacious woman with blond, puffed hair. They didn\u2019t seem to be talking about the pangs of death and the light ahead. What would he do if she walked over and tackled him on that subject? Nobody would have the heart to. Or the bad manners. Instead, she looked at Pierre and the bush doctor. Pierre was talking with a boyish liveliness she didn\u2019t often see in him these days. She occupied herself by pretending that she was seeing him for the first time now. His curly, short-cropped, very dark hair receding at the temples, baring the smooth, gold-tinged ivory skin. His wide, sharp shoulders and long, fine limbs and nicely shaped, rather small skull. He smiled enchantingly but never to charm, and seemed to distrust smiling altogether since he had become a teacher of boys. Faint lines of permanent fret were set in his forehead. She thought of a teachers\u2019 party\u2014more than a year ago\u2014when she and he had found themselves, at opposite sides of the room, left out of the nearby conversations. She had circled the room and got close to him without his noticing, and then she began to talk to him as if she were a discreetly flirtatious stranger. He smiled as he was smiling now\u2014but with a difference, as was natural when talking to an ensnaring woman\u2014and he took up the charade. They exchanged charged looks and vapid speeches until they both broke down laughing. Someone came up to them and told them that married jokes were not allowed. \u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019re really married?\u201d said Pierre, whose behavior at such parties was usually so circumspect. She crossed the room to him now with no such foolishness in mind. She had to remind him that they must soon go their separate ways. He was driving to Horseshoe Bay to catch the next ferry, and she would have to get across the North Shore to Lynn Valley, by bus. She had arranged to take this chance to visit a woman her dead mother had loved and admired, and in fact had named her for, and whom Meriel had always called Aunt, though they were not related by blood. Aunt Muriel. (It was when Meriel went away to college that she had changed the spelling.) This old woman was living in a nursing home in Lynn Valley, and Meriel had not visited her for over a year. It took too much time to get there, on their infrequent family trips to Vancouver, and the children were upset by the atmosphere of the nursing home and by the looks of the people who lived there. So was Pierre, though he did not like to say so. Instead, he asked what relation this person was to Meriel, anyway. It\u2019s not as if she was a real aunt. So now Meriel was going to see her alone. She had said that she would feel guilty if she didn\u2019t go when she had the chance. Also, though she didn\u2019t say so, she was looking forward to the time that this would give her to herself. \u201cMaybe I could drive you,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cGod knows how long you\u2019ll have to wait for the bus.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d miss the ferry.\u201d She reminded him of their arrangement with the sitter. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d The man he\u2019d been talking to\u2014the doctor\u2014had not had any choice but to listen to this conversation and said unexpectedly, \u201cLet me drive you.\u201d \u201cI thought you came here in an airplane,\u201d said Meriel, just as Pierre said, \u201cThis is my wife, I\u2019m sorry. Meriel.\u201d The doctor told her a name which she hardly heard. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy landing a plane on Hollyburn Mountain,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I left it at the airport and rented a car.\u201d Some slight forcing of courtesy, on his part, made Meriel think that she had sounded obnoxious. She was often either too bold or too shy. \u201cWould that really be O.K.?\u201d Pierre said. \u201cDo you have time?\u201d The doctor looked directly at Meriel. This was not a disagreeable look\u2014it was not aggressive or sly, it was not appraising. But it was not socially deferential, either. He said, \u201cOf course.\u201d So it was agreed that this was how it would be. They would start saying their goodbyes now, and Pierre would leave for the ferry, and Asher, as his name was\u2014or Dr. Asher\u2014would drive Meriel to Lynn Valley. What Meriel planned to do after that was to visit with Aunt Muriel\u2014possibly even sit through supper with her\u2014then catch the bus from Lynn Valley to the downtown bus depot (buses to town were relatively frequent) and board the late-evening bus, which would take her to the ferry, and home.", "The nursing home was called Princess Manor. It was a one-story building with extended wings, covered in pinkish-brown stucco. The street was busy, and there were no grounds to speak of, no hedges or fences to shut out noise or protect the scraps of lawn. On one side, there was a Gospel Hall with a joke of a steeple, on the other a gas station. \u201cThe word \u2018manor\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean anything at all anymore, does it?\u201d said Meriel. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even mean there\u2019s an upstairs. It just means that you\u2019re supposed to think that a place is something it doesn\u2019t even pretend to be.\u201d The doctor said nothing\u2014perhaps what she had said didn\u2019t make any sense to him. Or wasn\u2019t worth saying even if it did. All the way from Dundarave, she had listened to herself talking and been dismayed. It wasn\u2019t so much that she was prattling, saying just anything that came into her head; rather, that she was trying to express things that seemed to her interesting, or that might have been interesting if she could get them into shape. But they probably sounded pretentious, if not insane, rattled off in the way she was doing. She must seem like one of those women who are determined not to have an ordinary conversation but a real one. And even though she knew that nothing was working, that her talk must seem to him an imposition, she was unable to stop herself. She didn\u2019t know what had started this. Unease, simply because she so seldom talked to a stranger nowadays? The oddity of riding alone in a car with a man who wasn\u2019t her husband? She had even asked, rashly, what he thought of Pierre\u2019s notion that the motorcycle accident was suicide. \u201cYou could float that idea around about any number of violent accidents,\u201d he had said. \u201cDon\u2019t bother pulling into the drive,\u201d she said. \u201cI can get out here.\u201d So embarrassed, so eager was she to get away from him and his barely polite indifference that she put her hand on the door handle, as if to open it, while they were still moving along the street. \u201cI was planning to park,\u201d he said, turning in anyway \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave you stranded.\u201d She said, \u201cI might be quite a while.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I can wait. Or I could come in and look around. If you wouldn\u2019t mind that.\u201d She was about to say that nursing homes can be dreary and unnerving. Then she remembered that he was a doctor and would see nothing here that he had not seen before. And something in the way he had said \u201cif you wouldn\u2019t mind that\u201d\u2014some mild formality, but also an uncertainty in his voice\u2014astonished her. It seemed that he was making an offering of his time and his presence that had little to do with courtesy but, rather, something to do with herself. It was an offer made with a touch of frank humility, but it was not a plea. If she had said that she would really rather not take up any more of his time, he would not have tried any further persuasion; he would have said goodbye with an even courtesy and driven away. As it was, they got out of the car and walked side by side across the parking lot, toward the front entrance. Several old or disabled people were sitting out on a square of pavement that had a few furry-looking shrubs and pots of petunias around it to suggest a garden patio. Aunt Muriel was not among them, but Meriel found herself bestowing greetings. Every step she took, she felt as if there were a wire that lit up, a bright message travelling from her heels to the top of her skull. (When she asked him later \u201cWhy did you come in there with me?\u201d he said, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to lose sight of you.\u201d) Aunt Muriel was sitting by herself, in a wheelchair, in the dim corridor just outside her own bedroom door. She was fat and glimmering\u2014but that was because of being swathed in an asbestos apron so she could smoke a cigarette. Meriel believed that when she had said goodbye to her, months and seasons ago, she had been sitting in the same chair in the same spot\u2014though without the asbestos apron, which must accord with some new rule, or reflect some further decline. Very likely, she sat here every day beside the fixed ashtray filled with sand, looking at the liverish painted wall (they had painted it pink or mauve, but it looked liverish, the corridor being so dim) with the bracket shelf on it supporting a spill of fake ivy. \u201cMeriel? I thought it was you,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI could tell by your steps. I could tell by your breathing. My cataracts have got quite vicious. All I can see is blobs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s me, all right. How are you?\u201d Meriel kissed her temple. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out in the sunshine?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not fond of sunshine,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cI have to think of my complexion.\u201d She might have been joking, but it was perhaps the truth. Her pale face and hands were covered with large spots\u2014dead-white spots that caught what light there was here, turning silvery. She had been a true blonde, pink-faced, lean, with straight, well-cut hair that had gone white in her thirties. Now the hair was ragged, mussed from being rubbed into pillows, and the lobes of her ears hung out of it like flat teats. And she used to wear little diamonds in her ears\u2014where had they gone? Diamonds in her ears, real gold chains, real pearls, silk shirts of unusual colors\u2014amber, aubergine\u2014and beautiful narrow shoes. She smelled of hospital powder and the licorice drops she sucked all day between the rationed cigarettes. \u201cWe need some chairs,\u201d she said. She leaned forward, waved the cigarette hand in the air, tried to whistle. \u201cService, please. Chairs.\u201d The doctor said, \u201cI\u2019ll find some.\u201d The old woman and the young one were left alone. \u201cWhat\u2019s your husband\u2019s name?\u201d \u201cPierre.\u201d \u201cAnd you have the two children, don\u2019t you? Jane and David?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. But the man who\u2019s with me\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, no. That\u2019s not your husband.\u201d Aunt Muriel belonged to Meriel\u2019s grandmother\u2019s generation, rather than her mother\u2019s. She had been Meriel\u2019s mother\u2019s art teacher at school, first an inspiration, then an ally, then a friend. She had painted large abstract pictures, one of which\u2014a present to Meriel\u2019s mother\u2014had hung in the back hall of the house where Meriel grew up and been moved to the dining room whenever the artist came to visit. Its colors were murky\u2014dark reds and browns (Meriel\u2019s father called it \u201cManure Pile on Fire\u201d)\u2014but Aunt Muriel\u2019s spirit seemed always bright and dauntless. She had lived in Vancouver when she was young, before she came to teach in this town in the interior. She had been friends with artists whose names were now in the papers. She longed to go back there and eventually did, to live with and manage the affairs of a rich old couple who were friends and patrons of artists. She was left out in the cold when they died. She lived on her pension, took up watercolors because she could not afford oils, starved herself (Meriel\u2019s mother suspected) so that she could take Meriel out to lunch\u2014Meriel being then a university student. On these occasions she talked in a rush of jokes and judgments, mostly pointing out how works and ideas that people raved about were rubbish, but how here and there\u2014in the output of some obscure contemporary or half-forgotten figure from another century\u2014there was something extraordinary. That was her stalwart word of praise\u2014extraordinary. A hush in her voice, as if there and then and rather to her own surprise she had come on something in the world that was still to be absolutely honored. The doctor returned with two chairs and introduced himself, quite naturally, as if there\u2019d been no chance to do it till now. \u201cEric Asher.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a doctor,\u201d said Meriel. She was about to start explaining about the funeral, the accident, the flight down from Smithers, but the conversation was taken away from her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here officially, don\u2019t worry,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Aunt Muriel. \u201cYou\u2019re here with her.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. At this moment he reached across the space between their two chairs and picked up Meriel\u2019s hand, holding it for a moment in a hard grip, then letting it go. And he said to Aunt Muriel, \u201cHow could you tell that? By my breathing?\u201d \u201cI could tell,\u201d she said with some impatience. \u201cI used to be a devil myself.\u201d Her voice\u2014the quaver or titter in it\u2014made Meriel feel that there was some betrayal stirring: a betrayal of the past, perhaps of her, Meriel\u2019s, mother, and the kind of friendship she had had with this woman, or thought she had. Or of those lunches with Meriel herself, the high-minded discussions. Some degradation, which remotely excited her. \u201cOh, I used to have friends,\u201d Aunt Muriel said. \u201cSome people who had a place where we all used to go, on Bowen Island. The Delaneys. You don\u2019t remember the Delaneys?\u201d She spoke directly to the man, not to Meriel. \u201cI don\u2019t think I do,\u201d he said. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI thought you might have heard of them. Well, there were various goings on. What took place there might have looked like an adventure but it was all according to script, if you know what I mean. So not so much of an adventure, actually. We all got drunk as skunks, of course. But they always had to have the candles lit in a circle and the music on, of course\u2014more like a ritual. But not altogether. It didn\u2019t mean you mightn\u2019t meet somebody new and let the script go all to hell. Just meet for the first time and start kissing like mad and run off into the forest. In the dark. You couldn\u2019t get very far. Never mind. Struck down.\u201d She had started to cough, tried speaking through the cough, gave up, and hacked violently. The doctor got up and struck her expertly a couple of times on her bent back. The coughing ended with a groan. \u201cBetter,\u201d she said, and retrieved her story. \u201cOh, you knew what you were doing but you pretended not to. One time, they had a blindfold on me. Not out in the woods, that was inside. It was all right, I consented. It didn\u2019t work so well, though\u2014I mean, I did know. There probably wasn\u2019t anybody there that I wouldn\u2019t have recognized, anyway.\u201d She coughed again, though not so desperately as before. Then she raised her head, breathed deeply and noisily for a few minutes, holding up her hands to stall the conversation, as if she would soon have something more, something important, to say. But all she did, finally, was laugh and say, \u201cNow I\u2019ve got a permanent blindfold. Cataracts. Doesn\u2019t get me taken advantage of, in any debauch that I know about.\u201d \u201cHow long have they been growing?\u201d the doctor said with a respectful interest, and to Meriel\u2019s great relief there began an absorbed conversation, an informed discussion about the ripening of cataracts, their removal, the pros and cons of this operation, and Aunt Muriel\u2019s distrust of the eye doctor who was shunted off\u2014as she said\u2014to look after the people in here. Salacious fantasy\u2014that was what Meriel now decided it had been\u2014slid without the smallest difficulty into a medical chat, agreeably pessimistic on Aunt Muriel\u2019s side and carefully reassuring on the doctor\u2019s. The sort of conversation that must take place regularly within these walls. A glance was exchanged between Meriel and the doctor, asking whether the visit had lasted long enough. A stealthy, considering, almost married glance, its masquerade and its bland intimacy arousing to those who were, after all, not married. Soon. Aunt Muriel took the initiative herself. She said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s rude of me, I have to tell you\u2014I get tired.\u201d No hint in her manner now of the person who had launched the first part of the conversation. Distracted, playacting, and with a vague feeling of shame, Meriel said goodbye. She had a feeling that she would never see Aunt Muriel again, and she never did. Around a corner, with doors open on rooms where people lay asleep or perhaps watching from their beds, the doctor touched Meriel between her shoulder blades and moved his hand down her back to her waist. She realized that he was picking at the cloth of her dress, which had stuck to her damp skin when she sat pressed against the chair back. The dress was also damp under her arms. And she had to go to the bathroom. She kept looking for the visitors\u2019 washrooms, which she thought she had spotted when they were on their way in. There. She was right. A relief but also a difficulty, because she had to move suddenly out of his range and say \u201cJust a moment,\u201d in a voice that sounded to herself distant and irritated. He said, \u201cYes,\u201d and briskly headed for the men\u2019s room, and the delicacy of the moment was lost. When she went out into the hot sunlight, she saw him pacing by the car, smoking. He hadn\u2019t smoked before\u2014not in Jonas\u2019s parents\u2019 house or on the way here or with Aunt Muriel. The act seemed to isolate him, to show some impatience, perhaps an impatience to be done with one thing and get on to the next. Meriel was not so sure now whether she was the next thing or the thing to be done with. \u201cWhere to?\u201d he said, when they were driving. Then, as if he thought he had spoken too brusquely, \u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d It was almost as if he were speaking to a child, or to Aunt Muriel\u2014somebody he was bound to entertain for the afternoon. And Meriel said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d as if she had no choice but to let herself become that sullen, burdensome child. She was holding in a wail of disappointment, a clamor of desire. Desire that had seemed to be shy and sporadic but inevitable, yet was now all of a sudden to be declared inappropriate, one-sided. His hands on the wheel were all his own, reclaimed, as if he had never touched her. \u201cHow about Stanley Park? Would you like to go for a walk in Stanley Park?\u201d She said, \u201cOh, Stanley Park. I haven\u2019t been there for ages,\u201d as if the idea had perked her up and she could imagine nothing better. And she made things worse by adding, \u201cIt\u2019s such a gorgeous day.\u201d \u201cIt is. It is indeed.\u201d They spoke like caricatures\u2014it was unbearable. \u201cThey don\u2019t give you a radio in these rented cars. Well, sometimes they do. Sometimes not.\u201d She wound her window down as they crossed the Lions Gate Bridge. She asked him if he minded. \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d \u201cIt always means summer to me. To have the window down and your elbow out and the breeze coming in\u2014I don\u2019t think I could ever get used to air-conditioning.\u201d \u201cCertain temperatures, you might.\u201d She willed herself to silence, till the forest of the park received them, and the high, thick trees could perhaps swallow witlessness and shame. Then she spoiled everything by her too deep and appreciative sigh. Prospect Point. He read the sign aloud. There were plenty of people around, even though it was a weekday afternoon in May, with vacations not yet started. In a moment they might remark on that. There were cars parked all along the drive up to the restaurant, and lines on the viewing platform for the coin-op binoculars. \u201cAha.\u201d He had spotted a car pulling out of its place. A reprieve for a moment from any need for speech, while he idled, backed to give it room, then maneuvered into the fairly narrow spot. They got out at the same time, walked around to meet on the sidewalk. He turned this way and that, as if deciding where they were to walk. Pedestrians coming and going on any path you could see. Her legs were shaking. She could not put up with this any longer. \u201cTake me somewhere else,\u201d she said. He looked her in the face. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d There on the sidewalk in the world\u2019s view. Kissing like mad.", "Take me was what she had said. Take me somewhere else, not Let\u2019s go somewhere else. That is important to her. The risk, the transfer of power. Complete risk and transfer. Let\u2019s go\u2014that would have the risk, but not the abdication, which is the start for her, in all her reliving of this moment, of the erotic slide. And what if he had abdicated in his turn? Where else? That would not have done, either. He has to say just what he did say. He has to say Yes. He took her to the apartment where he was staying, in Kitsilano. It belonged to a friend of his who was away on a fishing boat, somewhere off the west coast of Vancouver Island. It was in a small, decent building, three or four stories high, inexpensive rather than cheap-looking. All that she would remember about it would be the glass bricks around the front entrance and the elaborate, heavy hi-fi equipment of that time, which seemed to be the only furniture in the living room. She would have preferred another scene, and that was the one she substituted, in her memory. A narrow six- or seven-story hotel, once a fashionable place of residence, in the West End of Vancouver. Curtains of yellowed lace, high ceilings, perhaps an iron grille over part of the window, a fake balcony. Nothing actually dirty or disreputable, just an atmosphere of long accommodation of private woes and sins. There she would have to cross the little lobby with head bowed and arms clinging to her sides, her whole body permeated by exquisite shame. And he would speak to the desk clerk in a low voice that did not advertise, but did not conceal or apologize for, their purpose. Then the ride in the old-fashioned cage of the elevator, run by an old man\u2014or perhaps an old woman, perhaps a cripple, a sly servant of vice. Why did she conjure up, why did she add that scene? It was for the moment of exposure, the piercing sense of shame and pride that took over her body as she walked through the (pretend) lobby, and for the sound of his voice\u2014its discretion and authority\u2014speaking to the clerk the words that she could not quite make out. That might have been his tone in the drugstore a few blocks away from the apartment, after he had parked the car and said, \u201cJust a moment in here.\u201d The practical arrangements, which seemed heavyhearted and discouraging in married life, could in these different circumstances provoke a subtle heat in her, a novel lethargy and submissive anticipation.", "After dark, she was carried back again, driven through the park and across the bridge and through West Vancouver, passing only a short distance from the house of Jonas\u2019s parents. She arrived at Horseshoe Bay at almost the very last moment, and walked onto the ferry. The last days of May are among the longest of the year and, in spite of the ferry-dock lights and the lights of the cars streaming into the belly of the boat, she could see some glow in the western sky and, against it, the black mound of an island\u2014not Bowen but one whose name she did not know\u2014tidy as a pudding set in the mouth of the bay. She had to join the crowd of jostling bodies making their way up the stairs, and when she reached the passenger deck she sat in the first seat she saw. She did not even bother, as she usually did, to look for a seat next to a window. She had an hour and a half before the boat docked on the other side of the strait, and during this time she had a great deal of work to do. No sooner had the boat started to move than the people beside her began to talk. They were not casual talkers who had met on the ferry but friends or family who knew each other well and would find plenty to say for the entire crossing. So she got up and climbed to the top deck, where there were always fewer people, and sat on one of the bins that contained life preservers. She ached in expected and unexpected places. The job she had to do, as she saw it, was to remember everything\u2014and, by remember, she meant experience it in her mind, one more time\u2014then store it away forever. This day\u2019s experience set in order, none of it left ragged or lying about, all of it gathered in like treasure and finished with, set aside. She held on to two predictions, the first one comfortable and the second easy enough to accept at present, though no doubt it would become harder for her later on. Her marriage with Pierre would continue, it would last. She would never see the doctor again. Both of these turned out to be right.", "Her marriage did last, for more than thirty years after that\u2014until Pierre died. During an early and not too painful stage of his illness, she read aloud to him, getting through a few books that they had both read years ago and meant to go back to. One of these was \u201cFathers and Sons.\u201d After she had read the scene in which Bazarov declares his violent love for Anna Sergeyevna, and Anna is horrified, they broke off for a discussion. (Not an argument\u2014they had grown too tender for that.) Meriel wanted the scene to go differently. She believed that Anna would not react in that way. \u201cIt\u2019s the writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t usually ever feel that, but here I feel it\u2019s just Turgenev coming and yanking them apart and he\u2019s doing it for some purpose of his own.\u201d Pierre smiled faintly. All his expressions had become sketchy. \u201cYou think she\u2019d succumb?\u201d \u201cNo. Not succumb. I don\u2019t believe her\u2014I think she\u2019s as driven as he is. They\u2019d do it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s romantic. You\u2019re wrenching things around to make a happy ending.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about the ending.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d said Pierre patiently. \u201cIf Anna gave in, it\u2019d be because she loved him. When it was over, she\u2019d love him all the more. Isn\u2019t that what women are like? I mean, if they\u2019re in love? And what he\u2019d do\u2014he\u2019d take off the next morning, maybe without even speaking to her. That\u2019s his nature. He hates loving her. So how would that be any better?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d have something. Their experience.\u201d \u201cHe would pretty well forget it, and she\u2019d die of shame and rejection. She\u2019s intelligent. She knows that.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Meriel, pausing for a bit, because she felt cornered. \u201cWell, Turgenev doesn\u2019t say that. He says she\u2019s totally taken aback. He says she\u2019s cold.\u201d \u201cIntelligence makes her cold. Intelligent means cold, for a woman.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI mean in the nineteenth century. In the nineteenth century it does.\u201d", "That night on the ferry, during the time when she thought she was going to get everything straightened away, Meriel did nothing of the kind. What she had to go through was wave after wave of intense recollection. And this was what she would continue to go through\u2014at gradually lengthening intervals\u2014for years to come. She would keep picking up things she\u2019d missed, and these would still jolt her. She would hear or see something again\u2014a sound they made together, the sort of look that passed between them, of recognition and encouragement. A look that was in its way quite cold, yet deeply respectful and more intimate than any look that would pass between married people, or people who owed each other anything. She remembered his hazel-gray eyes, the close-up view of his coarse skin, a circle like an old scar beside his nose, the slick breadth of his chest as he reared up from her. But she could not have given a useful description of what he looked like. She believed that she had felt his presence so strongly, from the very beginning, that ordinary observation was not possible. Sudden recollection of even their early, unsure and tentative moments could still make her fold in on herself, as if to protect the raw surprise of her own body, the racketing of desire. My-love-my-love, she would mutter in a harsh, mechanical way, the words a secret poultice. When she saw his picture in the paper, this did not happen. The clipping had been sent by Jonas\u2019s mother, who as long as she lived insisted on keeping in touch, and reminding them, whenever she could, of Jonas. \u201cRemember the doctor at Jonas\u2019s funeral?\u201d she had written above the small headline. \u201cBUSH DOCTOR DEAD IN AIR CRASH.\u201d It was an old picture, surely, blurred in its newspaper reproduction. A rather chunky face, smiling\u2014which she would never have expected him to do for the camera. He hadn\u2019t died in his own plane but in the crash of a helicopter on an emergency flight. She showed the clipping to Pierre. She said, \u201cDid you ever figure out why he came to the funeral?\u201d \u201cThey might have been buddies of a sort. All those lost souls up north.\u201d \u201cWhat did you talk to him about?\u201d \u201cHe told me about one time he took Jonas up to teach him to fly. He said, \u2018Never again.\u2019\u201d Then Pierre asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t he drive you someplace? Where?\u201d \u201cTo Lynn Valley. To see Aunt Muriel.\u201d \u201cSo what did you talk about?\u201d \u201cI found him hard to talk to.\u201d The fact that he was dead did not seem to have much effect on Meriel\u2019s daydreams\u2014if that was what you could call them. The ones in which she imagined chance meetings, or even desperately arranged reunions, had never had a foothold on reality, in any case, and were not revised because he was dead. They had to wear themselves out in a way she did not control and never understood. When she was on her way home that night, it had started to rain, not very hard. She stayed out on the deck of the ferry. She got up and walked around and could not sit down again on the lid of the life-jacket bin without getting a big wet spot on her dress. So she stayed looking at the froth stirred up in the wake of the boat and the thought occurred to her that in a certain kind of story\u2014not the kind that anybody made up anymore\u2014the thing for her to do would be to throw herself into the water. Just as she was, packed full of happiness, rewarded as she would surely never be again, every cell in her body plumped up with a sweet self-esteem. A romantic act that could be seen\u2014from a forbidden angle\u2014as supremely rational. Was she tempted? She was probably just letting herself imagine being tempted. Probably nowhere near yielding, though yielding had been the order of that day."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/02/19/what-is-remembered", "keywords": ["mother", "doctor", "way", "say", "muriel", "remembered", "pierre", "didnt", "aunt", "old", "meriel"], "summary": "She smiles, because she has remembered something that Queen Sirikit of Thailand said, or was quoted as saying, in a magazine.\nAunt Muriel.\nAlso, though she didn\u2019t say so, she was looking forward to the time that this would give her to herself.\nThen she remembered that he was a doctor and would see nothing here that he had not seen before.\nShe remembered his hazel-gray eyes, the close-up view of his coarse skin, a circle like an old scar beside his nose, the slick breadth of his chest as he reared up from her.", "authors": ["Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Jane Mayer", "Deborah Treisman"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "a13b1235-77cd-3dea-aaef-834192769174"}
