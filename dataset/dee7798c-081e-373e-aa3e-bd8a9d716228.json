The first, released Monday, was a 658-page report by the House Judiciary Committee detailing the president\u2019s misdeeds. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna read that?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cYou expect the American public to read a 658-page anything? We can\u2019t even catch up on our TV shows.\u201d", "The second was a six-page letter Trump wrote to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which the president \u201ctakes zero responsibility for his impeachment\u201d, Kimmel summarized. \u201cOf course, he says the same thing about Eric and Donald Jr.\u201d", "Stephen Colbert: Republicans 'should at least pretend' to be fair on impeachment Read more", "The six pages decrying the impeachment process \u201cmight be the most deranged letter to Santa ever\u201d, Kimmel continued. \u201cIt is a long, stupid, disingenuous and incoherent defense signed by an angry gorilla with a Sharpie.\u201d", "The House will almost definitely pass the articles of impeachment this week, sending them to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial, which Kimmel said will be a \u201cjoke\u201d, since Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell already rejected Democrats\u2019 request for witnesses this week. \u201cHe wants a no-witness trial. He also said he\u2019ll be running the trial in close coordination with the White House \u2013 that seems fair,\u201d Kimmel panned. \u201cLet the guy on trial run it. Perfect.\u201d", "Stephen Colbert", "On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated \u201cimpeachment eve\u201d with a close reading of Trump\u2019s letter to Pelosi. Prior to Tuesday, Trump had been relatively quiet about impeachment, Colbert said, \u201cbut the pressure clearly was building under the surface because this afternoon, the lid blew off Mt St Yellin\u2019. The eruption came in the form of a six-page shriek addressed to Nancy Pelosi\u201d.", "The letter was full of anger toward Pelosi, including some choice quotes such as: \u201cYour spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America\u2019s founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d Colbert responded, \u201ca nation built on the belief that powerful white men face no consequences whatsoever.\u201d", "Colbert called the letter \u201ca disorienting mishmash of dry legal language mixed in with Trump\u2019s signature angry word smoothies. For example: \u2018the articles of impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence \u2026 You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!\u2019\u201d", "\u201cHappy now, Nancy?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve cheapened something very ugly. That goes against everything Trump stands for \u2013 making very ugly things extremely expensive.\u201d", "Trump also blamed the impeachment process on Democrats\u2019 bitterness from the election loss in 2016 and accused Pelosi of viewing \u201cdemocracy as your enemy!\u201d Colbert, imitating the president, clarified: \u201cWhereas I view democracy as a friend with benefits, because under me democracy is so screwed.\u201d", "Trump also wrote that \u201cmore due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials\u201d.", "\u201cYou know what? I agree with the president on this one,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cFair is fair \u2013 we should throw him in the river.\u201d", "Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he took \u201czero\u201d responsibility for impeachment, which means, according to Colbert, \u201che takes foreign assistance, he takes daddy\u2019s handouts, he takes a handful of any women who wanders into the grope zone, but he draws the line at responsibility\u201d.", "Seth Meyers", "Seth Meyers also addressed Trump\u2019s letter on Late Night, in which the president said the impeachment inquiry was full of \u201cshameless lies and deception\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich is true, it\u2019s called evidence,\u201d Meyers retorted.", "\u201cThis letter is bonkers,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe the tone of it.
