The Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, did \u201cregret the anxiety and upset caused by the ESL proposal\u201d.", "The Super League had been announced as being in train, like an unstoppable force, at 11pm on Sunday, with the six English signatories being joined by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid from Spain and Juventus, Internazionale and Milan from Italy. On Monday, there were fears among supporters across Europe that nothing could stand in the way of the closed-shop tournament, which would have gravely undermined the game\u2019s competitive spirit.", "Chelsea fans protest outside Stamford Bridge before the game with Brighton.

In England, it came from the royal family and government downwards, taking in the Premier League\u2019s \u201cOther 14\u201d clubs, with fans mobilising in numbers, particularly across social media, to decry the scheme.", "The Football Association had taken a key stand earlier on Tuesday when it warned that any club involved would be banned from the Premier League and all domestic competitions. Before Liverpool\u2019s statement, to which nobody at the owner, Fenway Sports Group, put their name, two key figures from the club had voiced their opposition to the plan.", "The captain, Jordan Henderson, said on behalf of the squad: \u201cWe don\u2019t like it and we don\u2019t want it to happen. This is our collective position,\u201d while Kenny Dalglish, a club legend and nonexecutive director, urged the owners to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d.", "01:16 Chelsea fan protests turn to celebrations as club pulls out of Super League \u2013 video", "The FA\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, emboldened by the UK government\u2019s pledge to do whatever it took in legislative terms to block the breakaway tournament, said his organisation would take an uncompromising line with the rebel clubs.", "Bullingham articulated the FA\u2019s stance in a meeting with Premier League officials, including the chief executive, Richard Masters, and the division\u2019s other 14 clubs, who were united in their opposition to the big six\u2019s scheme. The FA is empowered to license clubs to compete \u2013 or otherwise. Bullingham and Masters had come off a separate call with Boris Johnson, who had reassured them that the government would move to support them if they encountered any issues with competition law. Put simply, Johnson said they would introduce new laws, if needed.", "Bullingham also told the meeting the FA would refuse to grant governing body endorsements \u2013 essentially work permits \u2013 for overseas players at clubs that participated in the Super League. The meeting, which began at 11am, was marked by a sense that each of the 14 clubs wanted the same thing \u2013 which is not always the case \u2013 and, as the day wore on, there would be a growing optimism that the breakaway had lost its impetus.", "The anger bubbled in plain sight. The 14 have no ill feeling towards the big six clubs themselves and they recognise how important they are to the Premier League product. But it is a different story in terms of their feeling towards the owners of them, together with the executives that do their bidding.", "There were calls at the meeting for reprisals against Ed Woodward, Bruce Buck and Vinai Venkatesham, among others \u2013 the day-to-day bosses at Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal; a call to explore whether they could be held to account for their actions, possibly via legal avenues. Woodward resigned as United\u2019s executive vice-chairman on Tuesday night but is due to continue until the end of the year.", "Chelsea and Manchester City in action in the Premier League in January.

And yet all the while, the six have plainly been plotting to break away. The 14 are now determined to put in place a mechanism so that this kind of behaviour cannot happen again.", "The Premier League had said in a strongly worded statement after its meeting that the 14 clubs \u201cunanimously and vigorously rejected the plans\u201d for a Super League. It went on that it was \u201cconsidering all actions available to prevent it from progressing, as well as holding those shareholders involved to account under its rules\u201d.", "Everton had earlier been fierce in their condemnation of the six English clubs involved in the Super League, accusing them of preposterous arrogance, subversive practices and disenfranchising their own supporters.

The backlash is understandable and deserved and has to be listened to. This preposterous arrogance is not wanted anywhere in football outside of the clubs that have drafted this plan.\u201d", "A number of other clubs, including Leicester and West Ham, both of whom hope to finish in the top four, went public with their opposition. Significantly, Pep Guardiola launched a scathing attack on the proposed tournament, even though City were due to play in it each season.", "\u201cIt is not a sport where the relation between the effort and the success, the effort and the reward, does not exist,\u201d City\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt is not a sport where success is already guaranteed or it is not a sport when it doesn\u2019t matter where you lose.", "Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I said many times, I want the best competition, the strongest competition possible, especially the Premier League.
