To Iranian Americans, many of whom have lived under sanctions in Iran or have family members there suffering through economic hardship, the fresh round of penalties is a painful reminder of the collateral consequences of escalating conflict.", "Iranian Americans across the United States told the Guardian about their worries for their family members and friends affected by US sanctions. And they spoke of the ways the policies affect their own lives, work and communities in the US. \u201cI was raised under sanctions my entire life,\u201d said Nazanin Asadi, 34, who left Iran for California in 2014 and now works as a law clerk in Orange county. \u201cAfter moving to the US permanently, I can\u2019t believe the sanctions and these laws are still chasing me \u2026 I don\u2019t want my community to suffer.\u201d", "Iranian Americans on edge as tensions surge: 'The fear is palpable' Read more", "\ufeffThe threats of a full-blown war following Trump\u2019s 3 January order to kill Gen Qassem Suleimani caused anxiety among some Persian communities in the US, especially for Iranian families who have been torn apart by Trump\u2019s travel ban. Trump backed away from additional strikes, but his administration implemented a fresh wave of sanctions, targeting senior Iranian officials and the country\u2019s textile, construction, manufacturing and other sectors.", "The US has imposed sanctions for decades, targeting Iran\u2019s energy sector and a range of exports of goods and services. Trump had already expanded sanctions against Iran in 2018 with his withdrawal from the nuclear deal signed under Barack Obama.", "Under sanctions law, people are forced to apply for specific licenses when they seek to be exempted from prohibited transactions, and even for allowed activities, there are complicated reporting requirements.
