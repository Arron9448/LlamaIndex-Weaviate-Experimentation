The men who arrived at the constitutional convention in 1787 brought with them a horror of monarchy. Absent a figure of George Washington\u2019s stature, the young country might have adopted a parliamentary system of government. Yet having created the office, the founders had to devise a way to remove presidents who abuse their positions\u2014not all people are Washingtons. They defined the mechanism: an impeachment vote in the House, followed by a trial in the Senate. The question of what exactly a president should be impeached for\u2014\u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours\u201d\u2014was deliberately left to Congress.", "Hence, though impeachment is a constitutional provision, it is also a political campaign. That campaign began in earnest this week when Nancy Pelosi directed her Democratic colleagues in the House to begin impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump. This will not necessarily lead to impeachment. In the past, though, impeachment hearings have generated a momentum of their own. The process is fraught with risks on both sides. One thing seems certain: the process will further divide a country that is already set against itself.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Ms Pelosi has taken such a momentous step because she believes the president\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine\u2019s government crossed a line. If that seems an obscure reason to contemplate unseating a president, remember that impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon had their origins in an office burglary and the ones against Bill Clinton began with an affair with an intern. Mr Trump appears to have let Ukraine\u2019s government know that relations with America, including the supply of aid, depended on it pursuing an investigation into the family of a political rival\u2014that would be more serious than a break-in or a fling. It would mean the president had subverted the national interest to pursue a political vendetta.", "The federal government often gives foreign powers promises of aid in exchange for doing something that America wants them to do. The Ukraine case is different (see Briefing). America has an interest in ensuring that Ukraine is able to defend itself against Russian aggression, which is why Congress came up with a package of $391m in military aid for its newly elected government. Mr Trump acted against the national interest in putting that aid on hold, while pressing Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, to investigate Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine and is the son of the Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden. If that were not clear enough, Mr Trump also sent his personal lawyer to meet an adviser to Mr Zelensky and repeat the message.", "In a country as corrupt and vulnerable as Ukraine the link between American support and investigating the Bidens\u2014you give us dirt on Joe and we\u2019ll give you weapons and money\u2014did not need to be explicit to be understood. \u201cI also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation,\u201d Mr Zelensky told Mr Trump in a call on July 25th.", "You might have thought the Mueller investigation into his campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia would have made Mr Trump wary of dallying with foreign governments. It seems not. His conduct looks a lot like bribery or extortion. And to use taxpayer funds and the might of the American state to pursue a political enemy would count as an abuse of power.", "The founders wanted impeachment to be a practical option, not just a theoretical one. Otherwise the president would be above the law, a monarch sitting on a throne for four or eight years. Declining to impeach Mr Trump would set a precedent for future presidents: anything up to and including what the 45th president has done to date would be fair game. Republican partisans should consider to what depths a future Democratic president, thus emboldened, could stoop.", "It would also signal to America\u2019s allies and foes that snooping on Americans who are influential or might become so was a fine way to curry favour with a president. There would be no need for the dirt even to be true. Russia and China, are you listening?", "Such are the risks of ducking impeachment. Yet the risks on the other side\u2014of pressing forward\u2014are great, too. Voters expect impeachment to be a last resort, not a trick by one party to remove a president from the other, or a means for the losers of an election to frustrate its result. House Democrats risk looking self-indulgent as, rather than getting on with fixing infrastructure or health care, they obsess over the minutiae of internal White House communications. The hearings may spin out of control and make Democratic politicians seem ineffectual and obsessive, as the stonewalling testimony of a former Trump aide, Corey Lewandowski, did last week. The hearings may also be too confusing and rancorous for the public to follow.", "Even if the House did decide to impeach Mr Trump, it is highly unlikely that he would be found guilty by the two-thirds majority needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of 100 seats. Legally, Mr Biden junior\u2019s sleazy dealings in Ukraine have no bearing on whether Mr Trump abused his office. Politically, though, the two are linked because they give Republican senators minded to defend Mr Trump a handy set of talking points.", "A failed impeachment that leaves Mr Trump in office might not be much of a deterrent to this president or to a future one. In fact it might even help Mr Trump, who could argue that he had been found innocent after a partisan witch-hunt by loser-Democrats. Until this week that was the calculus of Ms Pelosi and House Democrats from competitive districts. It is not clear that public opinion has yet shifted enough to change the equation. Though it may be bravado, Mr Trump\u2019s campaign team has always insisted that the more Democrats talk about impeachment the better it is for the president\u2019s chances of re-election in 2020.", "Cast the die", "Faced with such a daunting choice, Ms Pelosi had until now held back. But Mr Trump appears to be becoming more brazen as re-election draws near. The president\u2019s behaviour needs investigating, with the extra authority that the impeachment process confers. Better, therefore, to lean towards principle than pragmatism. But it is a risky and perilous path. \u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/26/the-promise-and-the-perils-of-impeachment", "title": "The promise and the perils of impeachment", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["president", "trump", "mr", "house", "impeachment", "promise", "ukraine", "office", "presidents", "pelosi", "political", "perils"]}
