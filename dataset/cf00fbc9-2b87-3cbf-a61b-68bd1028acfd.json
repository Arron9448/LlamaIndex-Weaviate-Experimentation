After telling him of her plan, the museum adviser replied: \u201cAh. One of those books where the author travels around the world in search of his or her roots \u2013 there are plenty of those now.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Stepanova. \u201cAnd now there will be one more.\u201d", "In Memory of Memory is an astounding collision of personal and cultural history, and Stepanova\u2019s first full-length book published in English, translated by Sasha Dugdale. It is a remarkable work from a writer who has won Russia\u2019s most prestigious honours (including the Big Book award for In Memory of Memory, the NOS literary prize, the Andrei Bely prize and a Joseph Brodsky fellowship); a writer who will likely be spoken about in the same breath as Poland\u2019s Olga Tokarczuk and Belarus\u2019s Svetlana Alexievich in years to come. But 2021 is the year of Stepanova: in addition to In Memory of Memory, her poetry collection War of the Beasts and the Animals, and a collection of essays and poems titled The Voice Over, will also be published in English this year. \u201cI feel a bit funny about it,\u201d she jokes, from her dacha outside Moscow. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit of an overkill?\u201d", "Stepanova was born in 1972 and raised in Moscow. \u201cI am a Muscovite,\u201d she says \u201cand have been living here for all my life, with short detours to different places.\u201d These include a year-long teaching position at Humboldt University in Berlin, as well as time as a visiting fellow at Selwyn College, Cambridge, just before the pandemic. Her pet corgi has enjoyed the lockdown, she says \u2013 but for her, the present circumstances hark back to her Soviet past, when travel freedoms were largely restricted: \u201cI know how privileged I am to bother myself with such petty grievances, but still I\u2019m pushed back to 1984, when seeing London was an impossibility.\u201d From her dacha, she is working on a new book and continuing her work as founder of colta.ru, Russia\u2019s only independent and crowdfunded cultural magazine, sitting somewhere between the Huffington Post and New York Review of Books.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Far from ordinary \u2026 one of the family photographs included in In Memory of Memory. Photograph: courtesy Maria Stepanova", "Stepanova\u2019s family was \u201cquite ordinary\u201d, she insists: Russian Jews who, for the most part, were spared the worst of 20th century\u2019s atrocities. And yet, In Memory of Memory \u2013 a narrative treasure chest of old documents, love letters, postcards, souvenirs, photographs \u2013 feels anything but ordinary. It deviates from a traditional family memoir, as Stepanova is far more interested in a story\u2019s gaps, the unknowability of the past. She resists linear chronology in favour of unlikely connections: writing about US artist Joseph Cornell, she drifts suddenly to sekretiki, a popular game she played as a child in the 1970s.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to transform my family into raw material for my own projections,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s unavoidable. But at least I should try to stay aside, to give them a chance to appear visible as they were, with their own voices and words and cherished belongings, with their mannerisms and incongruences.\u201d Stepanova seems haunted by this authorial paradox; she describes herself as both a product of the family and the one now in charge.", "Her ancestors brushed up against momentous episodes: the Revolution, the siege of Leningrad, Stalin's 'Doctors' plot'. Her grandmother spent time in prison", "Her family may have been ordinary folk, but many of her ancestors brushed up against some of the 20th century\u2019s most momentous episodes: the Russian Revolution, the siege of Leningrad, Stalin\u2019s \u201cDoctors\u2019 plot\u201d. Most memorable is her great-grandmother, \u201cBaba Sarra\u201d as Stepanova calls her, who spent time in St Petersburg\u2019s infamous prison, the Peter and Paul Fortress. \u201cHer story was one of the main fairytales of my childhood,\u201d says Stepanova. \u201cOur house was full of relics, filled with her, still very vivid, presence. What on earth could one do in our brisk and modest Soviet universe with an enormous French hat crowned with black ostrich feathers, or with a tiny box of visiting cards, or with a pair of gloves, foolishly tiny, as if produced for a fairy queen? It was all a riddle, too eccentric to be real, and endlessly fascinating.\u201d", "Stepanova is too aware and respectful, however, to romanticise riddles. \u201cThe truth of the past, whatever it is, is fragile and too easily replaced with our ready-made fantasies,\u201d she says. In the book, she describes how the past is often treated as \u201ca huge planet waiting to be colonised\u201d. For her, it might better be characterised as a moon: visible and alluring, but hiding much in its shadow. And why shouldn\u2019t some things stay hidden, she thinks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got photographs of unknown people who are supposed to be somehow important, stories that you are unable to connect with the pictures, places that were reconstructed, then bombed, built over again \u2013 and nothing speaks to you directly,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you understand that it\u2019s only fair \u2013 love\u2019s labours should be lost.\u201d", "When so many people seem to struggle to not document every moment with cameras or social media, to lose the record of a life now seems unimaginable. But for Stepanova, our abundance of information bears little relationship to reality. \u201cOur lives might be reconstructed in great detail with the help of endless rows of pictorial traces we leave behind, but I am not sure the result will have anything to do with truth,\u201d she says. \u201cWho is the tireless viewer that is supposed to be interested in someone\u2019s life in its entirety?\u201d Technology, she writes, \u201cshaves off time\u2019s natural build-up of lint\u201d. And In Memory of Memory is proof that this lint can produce unexpected and wonderful gifts.", "I started writing in an attempt to find a place for all the dispersed fragments of used language units, poetry lines, military terms and Soviet war songs, to understand better what has happened to us all Maria Stepanova", "Stepanova\u2019s poetry collection War of the Beasts and the Animals (also translated by Dugdale) was written in 2014 and 2015, during Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine. \u201cI had a feeling that events were doing something significant to the language I\u2019m writing in, that its outlines were changing, getting distorted, fragmented, broken, the sentences running mad, losing themselves,\u201d she says of the collection. \u201cI started writing in an attempt to find a place for all the dispersed fragments of used language units, poetry lines, military terms and Soviet war songs, to understand better what has happened to us all.\u201d What emerges is another archive of sorts, a home for language\u2019s changing and motley complexion.", "What then is Stepanova\u2019s answer to this puzzle of memory? Vladimir Nabokov \u2013 one of Stepanova\u2019s many literary companions in In Memory of Memory \u2013 once wrote: \u201cI think it is all a matter of love: the more you love a memory, the stronger and stranger it is.\u201d Stepanova, too, conceives of our relationship to memory as multidirectional; we simultaneously move towards, and away, from it.", "\u201cLove is the key word \u2013 you know it\u2019s an impossible task, yet you keep on digging,\u201d she says. \u201cYou realise that all the words said, paths taken and lessons learned aren\u2019t going to bring your dead back to life, even in the limited space of your writing. At the end, you\u2019re just standing there, somewhere, together with your lost ones \u2013 you alive, they not \u2013 in complete silence, a silence that is a form of embrace. You\u2019re finally home. You\u2019re utterly empty \u2013 and you\u2019ve arrived.\u201d"], "authors": ["Matthew Janney"], "keywords": ["russias", "lost", "stepanova", "great", "writer", "family", "book", "memory", "poetry", "war", "loves", "writing", "maria", "labours", "past", "ordinary", "soviet"], "pubDate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
