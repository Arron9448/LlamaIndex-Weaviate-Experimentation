Over the years it has been divided on Europe, NATO and devolution. It has lured those who dream of a socialist Scotland, and those who think it can be a low-tax rival to Ireland. Young Scandiphiles rub elbows with old Anglophobes. Electoral success and growing support for independence have bound it together.", "Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s predecessor as first minister and its leader in the independence referendum of 2014, announced that he was leading a new party, called Alba. The Scottish Parliament\u2019s electoral system comprises constituency and list seats, and is geared to stop one party becoming too powerful. Mr Salmond would like independence supporters to game this system, and back the SNP with one vote and Alba with the other, to create a parliament with a \u201csupermajority\u201d for independence.", "To many, it looks like revenge. Last year Mr Salmond was tried and acquitted on charges of sexual assault against ten women. He accused Ms Sturgeon\u2019s inner circle of a political plot to have him jailed, and he is suing the Scottish government over its handling of complaints against him. She doubts his fitness for office.", "But Mr Salmond is also prising open a growing fissure in the SNP over how to achieve independence. Under the Scotland Act which governs devolution, the union is the preserve of Westminster. The referendum of 2014 took place after the British government granted a legal instrument, known as a Section 30 order. Persuading Boris Johnson to do so again is Ms Sturgeon\u2019s strong preference; only if a referendum is recognised in London will it result in exit negotiations and statehood. Otherwise, it is a dead end.", "Many nationalists are sick of waiting, and are toying with more radical options. Mr Salmond has offered himself as their leader. A big nationalist majority in the Scottish Parliament would be a \u201cmandate to negotiate\u201d, he argues. \u201cIt is a fundamental mistake to put forward the Section 30 as the Holy Grail.\u201d He cites the \u201cvelvet divorce\u201d that split Czechoslovakia in the early 1990s as an example of a break-up that was preceded by an election, rather than a referendum. He won\u2019t be pinned to a strategy, but says options could include a plebiscite organised by the Scottish Parliament, securing international pressure, a constitutional convention of lawmakers or demonstrations.", "Two SNP members of parliament and a handful of councillors have defected to Mr Salmond\u2019s new party, but he probably won\u2019t force a major exodus at the ballot box. Some 79% of SNP voters say they have an unfavourable view of him, a similar figure to Tory voters.", "He could still find a niche. The SNP has become more Europhile since Brexit, and there is a split in the party over trans rights. Jan Eichhorn of the University of Edinburgh thinks he could win over socially conservative, pro-Brexit nationalists. Mr Salmond says he would like to attract working-class Scots who were animated by the referendum in 2014. The party has been held together by success, says Heinz Brandenburg of the University of Strathclyde: \u201cNow, the cracks are just showing at the most inopportune moment.\u201d", "Mr Salmond may cause more damage if he fails to find such a niche. Rather than creating a parliament stuffed with nationalists, Mr Salmond may fall short of winning seats, while also denying the SNP the list seats it needs to form an overall majority. The SNP strategy has long been to win the trust of suburban Scotland through cool-headedness. Alba may frighten away persuadable voters, says a veteran.", "Some of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s supporters are happy with the split. \u201cHe can have all the cranks that think we\u2019ll win independence by hanging flags off bridges, and we\u2019ll get on with speaking to the people we need to persuade,\u201d says one. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a colonic irrigation but I imagine this is what it feels like.\u201d Mr Johnson has several reasons to continue to refuse another independence referendum. Watching the once-disciplined nationalists scrap over strategy is a compelling one. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["salmond", "split", "referendum", "party", "independence", "sturgeons", "mr", "scottish", "alex", "parliament", "return", "snp"], "pubDate": "2021-03-31T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
